XHTML seems to have had a pretty significant detrimental effect on people's understanding of HTML syntax

[16:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
It used to be all nice and easy - you wrote <FONT></FONT> and you wrote <BR> and you just had to remember the handful of elements in the latter set

[16:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
HAPPY NEW YEAR!

[16:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: I can verify it is 2009 in Scotland :)

[16:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks from side to side of his monitor

[16:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
On one side, takkaria wishing happy new year; on the other, takkaria wishing no-one a happy new year.

[16:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't cope with this contradiction and his to make it known publicly ;p

[16:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray for popup EULAs, that are shown only once to each user (using the Windows registry to remember if it's been shown), on a program that I want to run as the SYSTEM user via a Windows service, which is user you cannot log in as while using an interactive terminal

[16:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
and therefore it's impossible to accept the EULA

[16:59:00.0000] <jcranmer>
just modify the registry

[17:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's what I'll do once I work out where the SYSTEM user's registry entries are

[17:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
It must be one of the S-1-50-{...} things, but I have no idea which :-/

[17:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/0//

[17:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, right, it's S-1-5-18

[17:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
How obvious

[17:03:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Duh.

[17:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also: the inability to copy-and-paste passwords into the Windows login prompt via rdesktop is annoying, because I didn't discover that until after I'd set a rather long password :-(

[00:38:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, regarding changing all instances of DOMObject to any, HTMLCanvasElement::getContext seems like one that should still be an object

[00:38:01.0000] <heycam>
i don't see how that could ever usefully return a non-object value

[00:39:00.0000] <heycam>
also, i'd suggest just using Object rather than DOMObject... there doesn't seem to be any advantage to using a typedef named DOMObject

[00:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it's also not ever going to return a Node...

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
so limiting it to just Objects seems a bit arbitrary almost

[00:44:00.0000] <heycam>
some language bindings may have to handle "any" values differently from Object

[00:45:00.0000] <heycam>
for ES it's no problem, obviously

[00:45:01.0000] <heycam>
/me shrugs

[00:45:02.0000] <heycam>
it's not that important

[00:45:03.0000] <heycam>
what's the deal with "attribute DOMString accept-charset;" ?

[00:46:00.0000] <heycam>
on HTMLFormElement

[00:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
typo; please send mail :-)

[00:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
mention the getContext() thing too, i'll change it back

[00:46:03.0000] <heycam>
k

[00:47:00.0000] <heycam>
btw, if i send mail to public-html, is it guaranteed to end up in your issues page?

[00:47:01.0000] <heycam>
since i sent a mail a month ago or so, and it didn't appear in that list or get replied to

[00:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
uri?

[00:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
is lists.w3.org down again?

[00:49:01.0000] <heycam>
apparently :/

[00:50:01.0000] <heycam>
oh, k

[00:50:02.0000] <heycam>
couldn't find it in the list

[00:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's in the WF2 folder

[00:51:00.0000] <heycam>
ah, thanks

[00:51:01.0000] <heycam>
be good if you could search that list, given they're not all expanded to do a ctrl+f on

[00:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip` has a static version of it

Hixie, what's the [XXX] on the ModalWindow interface for?

[01:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
the no interface thingy, i expect

[01:34:00.0000] <heycam>
ok.  just checking that it's not some other missing web idl feature.

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have like 100 idl-related e-mails to deal with

[01:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
so the idl blocks are way out of date

[01:47:00.0000] <heycam>
righto

[05:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Man.

[05:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Weather forecasts keep changing.

[09:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me is not an NS URI :-)

[09:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the example is saying that Eric Miller is cat Hedral

[09:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders how the Semantic Web deals if someone asserts that someone else is a cat

[09:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
They go about their business, with the added knowledge that someone is a cat

[09:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
You look in your FOAF social network to decide whether you should trust the person making the assertion

[09:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Trust? Why would anyone make a non-true assertion?

[09:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how does one distinguish between assertions about a person and assertions about a fragment in the person's file?

[09:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/file/resource representation/

[09:33:02.0000] <webben>
Shouldn't you chaps just accept the fact that Eric Miller is a cat?

[09:33:04.0000] <Dashiva>

Anyone here from around Edinburgh?

[09:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Or, more relevantly, in Edinburgh on Saturday?

[10:27:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me recommends the channels #swig to hsivonen 

[10:28:00.0000] <karlcow>
asserting that a thing is another thing is not an issue. It all depends on the context. And yes lies are already part of human languages mechanisms for ages. And that is fine.

[10:29:00.0000] <karlcow>
and useful in some circumstances.

[10:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: the example in the spec should probably not use a URI claimed by a W3C staff member, though.

[10:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me gets confused for moments, and wonders why the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator's IRC channel would be relevant

[14:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[14:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Eric chose HTML 5 because it permits any element to be an HREF"

[14:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Did I miss that?

[14:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps I should redesign my site. The style sheet dates from the Netscape 4 days

[14:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure wish people would tell me when we made decisions like that

[14:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[14:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe you did it in your sleep

[14:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i went to sleep because comcast went out

[14:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
and woke up when my ping -a started beeping

[14:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
so seems unlikely!

[14:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Perhaps he meant "it permits any element to be in an A HREF", which sounds more plausible?

[14:48:00.0000] <jcranmer>
"And we're expecting regular authors to usethis stuff? Sheesh." :-)

[14:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I think the real issue is Hixie isn't as good as most regular authors.

[14:49:01.0000] <jcranmer>

[14:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>

gsnedders: you're younger than I

[14:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jcranmer: And that's all it takes!?

[14:50:03.0000] <jcranmer>
I don't expect to see people younger than I doing serious work on specs

[14:50:04.0000] <jcranmer>

Hixie: In the "Internal Algorithm for Scanning and Assigning Header Cells", should "If there is no cell in the opaque headers list ... let blocked be True" read "If there are one or more cells in the opaque headers list ... let blocked be True"

[02:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
since it seems like the opaque headers list is a list of headers that can prevent the current header from applying

[02:14:02.0000] <jgraham>
But I might be misreading something

[02:24:00.0000] <Hixie>

[02:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I am implementing it but not right at the moment (I guess I will do some work on it this evening). And you shouldn't let me stop you from sleeping :)

[02:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: By post?

[02:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Of course.

jgraham: And if it's an offer, and not just being dumped into the pool, the UCAS website should be updated sometime

[02:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
Today?

[02:37:02.0000] <jgraham>
Otherwise I guess Monday is the most likely

[02:37:03.0000] <gsnedders>
The UCAS website? Whenever they feel like updating it, seemingly.

[02:37:04.0000] <hsivonen>

[02:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>

/me notes that UCAS are still better thean the Cambridge Board of Graduate Studies

[02:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
heh

[02:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
UCAS _are_ open today, at least.

[02:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
UCAS should have a pushed-based mechanism rather than requiring you to poll the web site

[02:39:03.0000] <jgraham>
They sent me a letter after I had been doing my PhD for a year telling me who my supervisor was

[02:39:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Like email?

[02:39:05.0000] <Philip`>
In particular, they should send MSN Messenger IMs, because that would work for most of their audience

[02:39:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: They say in all the literature that they will email you.

[02:39:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I realized that it was opt-in yesterday.

[02:39:08.0000] <Philip`>

[02:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Sorry, s/geeks/clever people/

[03:10:02.0000] <Hixie>

[03:10:03.0000] <zcorpan>
or i mean, well done :)

[03:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: It seems to me that preventing SVG <script> from doing document.write() the same way as HTML <script> requires special casing whereas treating them alike wouldn't.

[03:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the issue graph indeed looks good.

[03:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it actually requires less special-casing for me

[03:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: since i'd have to add text to make <svg:script> do something

[03:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I meant in Gecko.

[03:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i could be convinced to make document.write() work in <svg:script> if we _really_ wanted to, though i'd still be against doing it in any onload handlers. But it seems like the SVGWG would not want that, since it goes against their stated goals.

[03:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
maybe heycam can comment?

[03:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I want the onload handlers to go away

[03:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well

[03:31:02.0000] <zcorpan>

[03:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Does it build other than on Mac?

[03:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>

Nice one: "It could of course be the RDFa curie is worse than the disease."

yeah it's hard to say that last week is trolling us when he keeps posting examples of me not doing anything controversial or bad :-)

Advantage of using git-svn for html5: blame runs at a sane speed:)

[04:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
last week has really gone from a fun, scatological blog troll to something indistinguishable from any lame redditor with an axe to grind over HTML5

[05:26:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I do like how I manage to have an entire copy of the repo using git-svn taking up less space than an SVN checkout.

And things like blame are sanely quick.

[05:26:07.0000] <jgraham>

Hixie, which goal would allowing document.write() from <svg:script> violate?

[15:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: the goal of keeping svg fragments in text/html separable, so that you can drop them into standalone xml documents and still have them work


2009-01-03
[16:02:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, what other HTML APIs wouldn't work when you're working in a standalone xml document?

[16:09:00.0000] <heycam>
i mean, you can easily come up with some script in an SVG-embedded-in-HTML that would fail to work when you extract it out

[16:09:01.0000] <heycam>
/me afk

[16:10:00.0000] <roc>
that's sort of a generic problem with that goal

[16:11:00.0000] <roc>
that goal isn't even realized in XHTML

[16:11:01.0000] <roc>
because of namespaces, stylesheets and other things that prevent cutting and pasting from an XML document without data loss

[16:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that his ISP is seemingly blocking an entirely harmless page (a copy of a robots.txt) file from web.archive.org, via a system that claims to be filtering "indecent images of children" (and was blocking a Wikipedia page some weeks ago)

[16:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
although actually they're not blocking the page, they're rewriting links in the HTML in the page pointing to that page

[16:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, actually they seem to be blocking pretty much all of web.archive.org

[16:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: there aren't many APIs that would flat out not work (i.e. where there is no way to use the API in a way that would work)

[17:52:00.0000] <takkaria>
hmm

[17:53:00.0000] <takkaria>
maybe I should write an SVG fragment extractor for hubbub

[17:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
What is an SVG fragment extractor?

[17:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
Isn't it just getElementsByTagName('svg') plus an XML serialiser? :-)

[18:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
When it comes to getting significant long-term performance gains from web browsers running on multi-core CPUs, the parser seems like it's on the wrong side of Amdahl's law

[18:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's still got to loop through every byte in the document in order, and splitting one component into a separate thread can't do more than double the performance regardless of how many processors you have

[18:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me would like to learn why he's wrong, though :-)

[18:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the Refresh header has never been defined in any RFC or other standard (other than the HTML5 draft), right?

[18:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856

[18:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Knuth interview where he's generally critical/skeptical of value of parallelism and multithreading, but says "From the opposite point of view, I do grant that web browsing probably will get better with multicores. I’ve been talking about my technical work, however, not recreation."

[19:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: not to my knowledge

[19:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: thanks

[23:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is it just me or isn't incompatible ABIs on one operating system between different compilers a result of C++ being a Technical Specification?

[00:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and if you want to implement a comptetitive underdog C++ compiler, you need to reverse engineer the ABI of the incumbent compiler

[00:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why anyone would think a "Technical Specification" is a good idea, given the scale of evidence against the idea

[00:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
(that is, a spec that doesn't define precise conformance criteria for all conformance classes and doesn't leave things undefined)

[00:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
(at least in terms of processing content appropriate to the specification, of course; e.g. a network-level spec shouldn't talk about UI, etc)

[00:36:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: that is a good point

[02:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder why some IE installs send a UA-CPU HTTP header with requests

[02:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: to allow ActiveX install sites offer the right binary for 32 vs 64 bit?

[02:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, maybe

[02:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
what a lot of bandwidth to waste just for that

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
especially since it's already in the User-Agent header

[03:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://blogs.msdn.com/iemobile/archive/2006/08/03/Detecting_IE_Mobile.aspx mentions UA-CPU, and I assume it's not for ActiveX if it's on a mobile platform

[03:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.ppczone.net/forum/archive/index.php/t-268.html - fun

[04:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: a use case for Unicode in HTTP headers!

[04:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I assume by "doctypes" the original twitterer meant "doctypes I have used in my web publishing" which suggests he probably was including XHTML 1.x (but probably served as text/html)

[04:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm

[04:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
Didn't meant to do that

[04:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
Sorry, dody connection + scrollback = bad

[04:41:03.0000] <jgraham>
*dodgy

[04:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
I meant to say http://james.html5.org/tables/table_inspector.html now with (probably very buggy) support for the new HTML 5 algorithm

[04:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I may not be very responsive to bug reports over the weekend)

[05:13:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, header text is being shown in cells when you click them, which makes the layout jump around while checking relationships.

[05:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, was much better when clicking only did highlighting, imho

[05:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, this table works fine in Smart Headers mode but gives an error page in HTML5 December: http://james.html5.org/tables/table_inspector.py?input_type=type_uri&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fprojectcerbera.com%2Fgta%2F2%2Ftutorials%2Fmultiplayer-strategy&source=&algorithm=html5c

[05:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I also see: <meta name="MobileOptimized" content="width">

[05:21:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, it's justified as: "It's really useful if you try to build pages or sites that are targeted towards mobile end users."

[05:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, so if I've used semantic markup, logical source order, CSS layout and send a media="handheld" stylesheet with a linearised and compact layout which hides all but the most important things, I haven't "targeted towards mobile end users"? :|

[05:25:00.0000] <webben>
BenMillard: Where's this?

[05:25:01.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, http://blogs.msdn.com/iemobile/archive/2006/08/03/Detecting_IE_Mobile.aspx

[05:25:02.0000] <BenMillard>
(at the end)

[05:26:00.0000] <webben>
that article is lulzsome.

[05:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
maybe device independence doesn't work? :)

[05:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: If you've expended all that effort, but not actually tested in mobile devices and modified your page so that it works as well as possible in them (using whatever hacks are necessary if there's no better solution), you haven't done a good job of targeting real end users

[05:27:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, what I describe above works perfectly in all but the stupidest of mobiles, in my experience.

[05:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
like, the ones which apply media="screen" and try to do side-by-side page layout on narrow screens with no zoom :P

[05:28:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Openwave on my several-year-old, low-end Sharp handset handles it fine

[05:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Pocket IE tended to mess it up

[05:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: If end users use the stupidest of mobiles, that doesn't excuse you from using the necessary hacks to target them :-)

[05:29:02.0000] <webben>
mind you I guess it's older than the recent popularity of sophisticated media queries

[05:30:00.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, "popularity" seems rather an overstatement...

[05:30:01.0000] <webben>
meh s/popularity/appearance/

[05:30:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, they can probably install Opera Mini if they want to browse the actual web

[05:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
(But if most people use decent browsers nowadays, it seems to makes sense to target them in the cleanest possible way)

[05:31:01.0000] <webben>
BenMillard: Yep. If most of the web is unusable with their browser, are they likely to constitute much of an audience.

[05:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I've only seen a couple of devices try doing full-page layout on tiny screens without zoom. I've seen several which ignore positioning CSS but apply colours, some font styling and things like text-align. (Including 2 devices older than 5 years.)

[05:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: I would imagine most people have never heard of Opera Mini, so they would never realise they could install it

[05:34:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, yeah, so as webben says they probably don't do mobile browsing since their experience is "it doesn't work"

[05:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: (20 million Opera Mini users vs >3.5 billion moD[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[Dbile phone users is not a very good ratio)

[05:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
Um

[05:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Thank you SSH for inserting random garbage into my message

[05:35:01.0000] <webben>
Philip`: Yeah, but Opera Mini's hardly the only bearable mobile browser.

[05:35:02.0000] <webben>
Philip`: There's also the issue of depth of use.

[05:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, my impression is that stupid mobile browsers are a minority. A device I tested in 2004 ignored all but a few text styling properties, which is very conservative but sensible: http://projectcerbera.com/misc/mobile-support

[05:36:01.0000] <webben>
I know I use the web more for having a bearable browser on my phone than for having one that makes sites unusable.

[05:36:02.0000] <BenMillard>
(And that device was several years old, even in 2004)

[05:36:03.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose I must count as two Opera Mini users, but I've visited about three pages with it in the past couple of years

[05:36:04.0000] <BenMillard>
(it had a monochrome display)

[05:36:05.0000] <webben>
Philip`: I use it all the time.

[05:36:06.0000] <BenMillard>
oh wait, it could do white, black and blue

[05:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
I would be more likely to use a web browser on my phone if it didn't seem to cost huge amounts of money :-)

[05:37:01.0000] <webben>
for wikipedia/news/googling/twitter-following (no free SMS in UK) ... but I haz a fixed contract for "unlimited data"

[05:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, there was a big fanfare around flat-rate Internet access throughout the UK mobile networks last yea

[05:38:01.0000] <BenMillard>
r

[05:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
so my point is: building websites following the now long-established best practices for standards-based web design is enough for authors to reasonably expect mobile devices to work on their website

[05:40:01.0000] <BenMillard>
without adding <meta> tags, UA sniffing and suchlike

[05:41:00.0000] <webben>
I guess my point is: if you're going to spend $ optimizing, might as well spend $ on people who spend a lot of time on the phone browser - and those folks will tend to have decent browsers and favorable modern data contracts.

[05:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(by best practiceses I specifically don't mean MWBP, btw)

[05:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
All I know is that the person who pays the phone bill commented that there was ~1 UKP of WAP usage, and I'd only used it for about five minutes

[05:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
Also: I need to sort out Unicode support in my IRC client - the layout totally breaks if I type a £ :-(

[06:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that @font-face mostly sucks in browsers that use the native TrueType rasterization of Windows

[06:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
on XP

[06:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
due to lack of anti-aliasing and due to lack of Windows-oriented hinting in free-as-in-freedom fonts

[06:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what proportion of XP users has enabled ClearType

[06:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, in my experience it's only a few expert users (like me)

[06:05:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, the school I work for, my local library and the college I attended didn't have it turned on

[06:06:00.0000] <webben>
didn't IE7 enable cleartype by default?

[06:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: seems like bad news for @font-face in Opera and Firefox on XP

[06:06:02.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, yes but only inside IE7, not the whole OS

[06:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I thought XPsp3 would switch it on as a new default but it seems not

[06:08:00.0000] <webben>
oh i see

[06:08:01.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, so if you install IE7 on a non-ClearType XP you get smooth fonts in IE7 but not in any other browsers you use (unless they do smoothing in their own viewport by their own means)

[06:08:02.0000] <webben>
yep

[06:09:00.0000] <webben>
like Safari on Win does, right?

[06:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I can't even figure out how to turn ClearType on without resorting to googling

[06:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, right-click desktop, Properties item, Appearence tab, Effects button, "Use the following method..." checkbox, then set "ClearType" in the dropdown, then OK out of all the windows

[06:10:01.0000] <BenMillard>
simple :P

[06:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ah. I was in the right dialog but I was looking for a checkbox where I should have looked for a two-item popup

[06:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I opened the dialog about 3 times without seeing it, because I was looking for [ ] Use ClearType

[06:11:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, there are...interesting UI decisions like that throughout Windows

[06:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hisivonen, although Standard font smoothing is slightly different to none at all

[06:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
@font-face examples are still ugly in Opera. do I need to reboot or something?

[06:13:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, seems to switch immediately for me

[06:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh well. I guess the solution is to upgrade to Linux or OS X

[06:13:03.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, actually

[06:13:04.0000] <BenMillard>
unticking it seems to work without reboot

[06:13:05.0000] <BenMillard>
ticking and selecting Standard works

[06:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ah, ticking and selecting ClearType worked the 2nd time

[06:14:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(I used the Apply button in Display Properties after each change, and used Opera's view of this channel to check if the change took effect)

[06:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, which examples are you using?

[06:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the ones under howcome's princexml.com directory

[06:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.princexml.com/howcome/2008/webfonts/

[06:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, ugliness confirmed here (Opera 9.63)

[06:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
heh, Ray Larabie made the Pricedown font used heavily in GTA3...he also designed cars and suchlike for the early GTA's

[06:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
now it worked

[06:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
still ugly compared to OS X, though

[06:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
This whole cleartype thing seems like snakeoil compared to FreeType, Quartz and whatever Adobe's renderer is called

[06:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. is ClearType enabled regardless of OS setting in Firefox 3.1?

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps Opera 10 should enable ClearType regardless of OS setting at least for @font-face fonts

[06:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Vista's new fonts were designed specifically to work with ClearType, which apparently makes it better

[06:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. no, it's not on all the time in Firefox. I just forget the microsoftish "Apply" button

[06:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, there are differences in font rendering between browser engines, even on the same OS with the same settings: http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/cairo-beats-safari

[06:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(I dare say desktop applications differ in similar ways, too)

[06:39:01.0000] <BenMillard>
s/desktop/desktop publishing/

[06:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fortunately, Microsoft says it has patents on ClearType, which hopefully keeps it away from Linux and OS X

[06:42:00.0000] <takkaria>
yeah, libfreetype can use cleartype but works around said patents by working out its own hintings, I believe

[06:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: I think that's about Apple's TT hinting patents

[06:43:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh, fair enough

[06:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://freetype.sourceforge.net/patents.html ?

[06:43:02.0000] <takkaria>
one day I should probably start knowing things before talking about them :)

[07:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so if natural language processing tools aren't available for $LANGUAGE, people whose native language is $LANGUAGE are better off using RDFa than using English???

[07:19:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: Wouldn't the argument more be: it's easier for authors to use RDFa, then to write NLP tools for those languages?

[07:20:00.0000] <webben>
(I don't think it's a good argument, but anyhow...)

[07:21:00.0000] <webben>
to be fair, it's something that comes up in microformats discussions

[07:21:01.0000] <webben>
people suggested trying to ditch the machine-data datatimes in favour of human-friendly formats

[07:21:02.0000] <webben>
but the idea always got shot down because of the complexity of parsing all the different locales

[07:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: isn't it easier to use English than RDFa?

[07:23:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: I wouldn't say it's easier for me to learn (say) Chinese than use RDFa, so not necessarily.

[07:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps it's offensive to suggest using English, but one might consider having to use RDF even more offensive

[07:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: Chinese and English are different

[07:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Dates aren't really a fair example, since machine-readable dates are also not-entire-stupid-human-readable :)

[07:24:02.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: And also, that's asking end-users to learn a different language just to read your content.

[07:25:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: Chinese and English are different because Chinese is objectively harder to learn or because English is more internationally spoken?

[07:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: both

[07:25:02.0000] <webben>
I think it would be easier for me to use RDFa than write my content in Spanish and ask my users to learn Spanish.

[07:26:00.0000] <webben>
(well, and learn it myself)

[07:26:01.0000] <webben>
heck, I'd probably find it easier to use RDFa than publish content in French - and I learned that at schoo.

[07:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: at least English, Spanish and French are human-authorable

[07:27:01.0000] <webben>
How is RDFa not human-authorable (as opposed to not easy to author)?

[07:28:00.0000] <webben>
I think the rules for writing correctly and idiomatically in a foreign language are much harder to learn than any technical language I've seen.

[07:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: everything is human authorable on some level

[07:31:00.0000] <webben>
human-author-friendly you meant?

[07:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
for example, English is more authorable than Finnish, because there are better text input methods for English

[07:32:00.0000] <webben>
you can type RDFa without worrying about accented characters, so I'm not sure on that reckoning it's less author-friendly

[07:33:00.0000] <webben>
but I think the interface difficulties are not comparable with the cognitive load

[07:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: you can dictate English. dictation solutions for RDFa aren't available AFAIK

[07:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
or predictive text entry with limited keys

[07:34:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: well, you can presumably dictate RDFa the same as RSI sufferers dictate other code?

[07:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: the alternative wasn't using other kind of code but putting a few natural-language words into Google/Yahoo!/Live search

[07:36:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: Hmm. I don't think the idea is for authors to construct RDF queries (well, not directly) and submit them to search engines.

[07:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: then the range of UI limits things even though RDF is touted as being able to express concepts not prescribed by an authority

[07:37:01.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: I'm not really sure what you mean.

[07:38:00.0000] <webben>
for example, a user of $LANGUAGE could enter a keyword in $LANGUAGE into Yahoo! search, and data could be extracted for display in the results page with a SearchMonkey

[07:38:01.0000] <webben>
without Yahoo! having to implement NLP tools for $LANGUAGE.

[07:38:02.0000] <webben>
(that much, at least, is possible now)

[07:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems to me that it's more efficient to implement superficial NLP for $LANGUAGE at a few companies than to do RDF at each publication point

[07:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
about UI concepts I mean this: Microformats solve n use cases with a small value of n.

[07:40:01.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: That's why I think the argument is weak, though to be fair it's hard to know without knowing $ cost of sufficient NLP.

[07:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
even if RDF syntax could express solutions for more use cases, the practical number of cases addressed will be limited by UI in both cases--not by syntax

[07:41:01.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: I'm confused why it couldn't be limited by both

[07:42:00.0000] <webben>
i.e. let's say there's a set of use cases which are not limited by UI and a set which are.

[07:43:00.0000] <webben>
it's not necessary that those sets can be mapped to the sets limited by microformat limitations and those not.

[07:43:01.0000] <webben>
that is, there could be a set limited by microformat limitations but not UI limitation.

[07:45:00.0000] <webben>
just as there could be a set limited by UI limitations not microformats limitations

[08:25:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm still not entirely clear on what RDFa does that you can't do with plain HTML

[08:25:01.0000] <takkaria>
except for "be RDF"

[08:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Curies? :)

[08:27:00.0000] <takkaria>
mm, curry

[08:27:01.0000] <jcranmer>
all I know about RDF is what I found inside mozilla

[08:27:02.0000] <jcranmer>
where I think it ought to be slaughtered and left for dead

[08:29:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, RDF-EASE is something I thought of years ago but abandoned it because I thought the markup would simply be <div> everywhere

[08:30:00.0000] <takkaria>
I dunno, I guess I just don't see the use in marking up data as being about a given URL

[08:30:01.0000] <takkaria>
data about an URL should be in the resource itself, really

[08:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is there a solution to what to do about malicious or just plain incorrect RDF statements?

[08:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
and what's this thing foaf and hcards do, assigning names and dates of births to urls?  tis the wrong way round

[08:33:00.0000] <takkaria>
actually, hcard doesn't do it

[08:33:01.0000] <takkaria>
foaf does though

[08:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: The URI is the identifier of a representation of a human being, so assigning names and dates of birth to a URI is just as good as assigning them to any other identifier

[08:38:00.0000] <takkaria>
the ontology is still upside-down, though; people have URIs, and people have names and dates of birth

[08:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's indirection :)

[08:40:00.0000] <takkaria>
I guess I just don't like saying that takkaria.org represents me, I'd rather say I owned takkaria.org

[08:41:00.0000] <danbri>
if i understand you, it's XFN that most directly equates people with their pages

[08:41:01.0000] <danbri>
the XFN idiom is to write in http://danbri.org/ that i'm xfn:friend with http://takkaria.example.org/

[08:41:02.0000] <danbri>
of course it is understood that the pages are serving as proxy identifiers, but the indirection isn't made as explicit as RDF (eg. FOAF) tends to encourage

[08:42:00.0000] <danbri>
in FOAF we say there's a Person, and they might have a 'weblog', 'homepage', or 'openid' property, whose value is a page URI

[08:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: It's not upside-down, it's a circle - people have names and names identify people, just like how people have URIs and URIs identify people, and you describe the properties of a person in relation to an identifier of that person (e.g. "John Smith was born on 1 Jan 1980" or "http://johnsmith.example.com was born on 1980-01-01" or whatever)

[08:42:02.0000] <danbri>
and they might have jabberID, name, mbox etc too, of course

[08:42:03.0000] <danbri>
re Dashiva: Is there a solution to what to do about malicious or just plain incorrect RDF statements?

[08:43:00.0000] <danbri>
...nope

[08:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and then you might also say "http://johnsmith.example.com owns the web page http://johnsmith.example.com")

[08:43:02.0000] <takkaria>
danbri: fair enough, I'm just going off wikipedia examples and what they look like

[08:43:03.0000] <danbri>
Can I politely say 'of course not'; the situation is same as with 'what to do about malicious or plain incorrect English/Spanish/... statements

[08:44:00.0000] <danbri>
there are techniques of course, eg. favouring statemnts that come from sources you have evidence for trusting (which will depend on the problem you're currently concerned with, the risks of getting it wrong, etc)

[08:44:01.0000] <takkaria>
Philip`: I see what you're saying, but names only identify people and sites don't only identify people

[08:44:02.0000] <takkaria>
I just see using site URIs as representing people as a bit of a semantic hack, I guess

[08:45:00.0000] <danbri>
there are techniques for encouraging rdf statements to tend towards not going stale, eg. define 'date of birth' rather than 'age'; however that is in tension with a reasonable desire to represent the things people write in web pages

[08:45:01.0000] <danbri>
so i'd write 'i'm 36' more than 'i was born in 1972', even if the latter is never going to go out of date, and the former will be false in < 365 days

[08:45:02.0000] <danbri>
with db-backed sites, the page containing 'i'm 36' is even more prevalent

[08:46:00.0000] <danbri>
yeah it's a bit of a hack takkaria, but one that lets us do data joins a lot easier --- less guesswork etc

[08:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: It's not a site URI, it's a page URI (which just happens to have no page name after the domain name) :-)

[08:46:02.0000] <takkaria>
heh

[08:47:00.0000] <takkaria>
true, but doesn't really affect the argument ^_^

[08:48:00.0000] <takkaria>
danbri: I guess-- I suppose I don't see the value of doing it particularly over the coolness factor

[08:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
danbri: Humans have builtin nonsense detectors. RDF parsers don't.

[08:51:00.0000] <annevk>
what's the use of marking up your age?

[08:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: The output of RDF parsers is eventually read by humans, who still have builtin nonsense detectors - I guess the issue is that it introduces a potentially large separation between the output (which is all the user can judge for nonsensicality) and the input (which is what the user ought to judge for nonsensicality)

[08:52:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And probably disassociates the source from the data as well...

[08:53:00.0000] <takkaria>
annevk: address book applications extracting data and showing it?

[08:56:00.0000] <danbri>
dashiva, one thing we took care to include in SPARQL (the rdf query language) is a construct for querying the source of the data (identified by uri)

[08:56:01.0000] <danbri>
so every claim in the rdf store is tagged with an optional URI, indicating where you found it (or who said it --- the admin scheme is up to you)

[08:57:00.0000] <danbri>
a reasonable compare/contrast is SQL, consider reasking the question 'what to do about malicious or incorrect SQL statements'?

[08:57:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't aggregation one of the big points about RDF? Wouldn't assigning sources to an aggregated statement get messy?

[08:57:02.0000] <danbri>
firstly - people don't dump raw SQL data in the Web; it isn't designed for that kind of interop/merging

[08:58:00.0000] <danbri>
secondly - RDF+SPARQL have some tricks (like the graph keyword alluded to just now) for keeping track of data imported from untrusted or semi-trusted sources

[08:59:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm not sure SQL is analagous to RDF, really?  not on the web, anyway.  SQL might be a solution for storing data, but it's got nothing to do with decentralised aggregation and merging

[09:02:00.0000] <annevk>
takkaria, people still use those?

[09:04:00.0000] <takkaria>
annevk: not convinced they do, but that's the only use I can think of

[09:05:00.0000] <takkaria>
really people are just better off using a vcard, though, I'd have thought

[09:05:01.0000] <annevk>
it's not like people are actually going to tag all that stuff when they write a blog or forum post

[09:05:02.0000] <annevk>
and don't tell me it will happen automatically, because then the data is just redundant

[09:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lots of sites ask your age, so they can refuse to show you content if you're under a certain age (to comply with COPPA laws or common sense or whatever) or so they can congratulate you on your birthday, and it'd be nicer if they could automatically determine that information when you've simply logged in and told them your homepage

[09:06:01.0000] <takkaria>
the other thing is of course that most peopel do

[09:07:00.0000] <webben>
danbri_ and takkaria: in the SQL-on-the-web line of things, http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/ be interesting if you haven't seen it.

[09:07:01.0000] <takkaria>
don't have homepages

[09:07:02.0000] <annevk>
I haven't seen studies, but I'd imagine lots of people have a profile page of some sorts

[09:07:03.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, wouldn't they use some kind of OpenID data provider for that info?

[09:08:00.0000] <takkaria>
true.  I imagine you're far better off implementing support for grabbing info from Facebook profiles than using any kind of markup extraction though

[09:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't have a homepage or a global profile page

[09:08:02.0000] <annevk>
philip.html5.org

[09:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's not a homepage, it's just a page with links to some stuff that I made :-)

[09:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
I have other sites with links to other stuff that I made

[09:09:02.0000] <annevk>
I would count all of them

[09:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
and none of them are a main homepage

[09:09:04.0000] <annevk>
doesn't have to be pretty

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
philip.html5.org doesn't even give my name, and it didn't even give an email address until fairly recently

[09:10:01.0000] <annevk>
but now it does

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
It still doesn't say who I am :-)

[09:12:00.0000] <annevk>
why is that needed?

[09:18:00.0000] <danbri_>
YQL - interesting, I knew it was on the way but missed the announcement. Google have a perhaps-similar subset used in the Google Viz APIs... wonder how they compare...

[09:19:00.0000] <danbri_>
re philip.html5.org ... if people use it like a homepage, eg. hyperlink to it when they mention you, ... maybe that's some large % of what being a homepage really is...?

[09:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
People rarely link to it - they just refer to me by name :-)

[11:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has not got into Clare College for comp.sci.

[11:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is also less sure than ever if he actually wants to do phys.

[11:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
So, basically, I have no idea what I'm doing later this year :P

[11:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(I have been put into the pool, but I really don't want to at a college out from the centre, who are the likely ones to have any space for pool applicants)

[11:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Meh.

[11:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh :-(

[11:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me obviously sucks at comp.sci.

[11:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Ones near the centre might still have places, because they sometimes just don't have enough candidates they would want to accept)

[11:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: They do however tend to have more applicants

[11:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Ignoring Churchhill)

[11:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
More waiting. fun.

[15:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's with people not actually answering the question with the rdfa thread

[15:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
was i that unclear?

[15:58:00.0000] <takkaria>
people think you're asking the wrong questions :)


2009-01-04
[16:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparently

[16:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just wish someone would tell me wtf the requirements are and wtf the problem is we're solving

[16:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
all i hear is "we solved this problem years ago, there's been lots of research, rdfa is the answer"

[16:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't even know what the question is!

[16:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
surely a url to the problem description would be a simple thing to provide if it's such a solved problem

[16:56:00.0000] <nessy>
rdf is about solving the problem of machine-readable interoperable metadata, FAIK

[16:57:00.0000] <nessy>
rdfa is a particular implementation of rdf through attributes, which I think is stupid

[16:57:01.0000] <nessy>
but don't quote me on this :)

[16:57:02.0000] <webben>
nessy: I don't think that's the sort of problem statement Hixie is looking for.

[16:57:03.0000] <nessy>
I think it should be done through class names

[16:57:04.0000] <nessy>
machine-readable interoperable metadata is not a problem?

[16:58:00.0000] <webben>
nessy: "machine-readable interopable metadata" is a vague solution to (set of) user and author problems.

[16:58:01.0000] <webben>
nessy: Hixie's email is effectively seeking a catalogue of those problems, I think.

[16:58:02.0000] <webben>
(or at least of examples of said problems)

[16:58:03.0000] <nessy>
fair enough :)

[16:59:00.0000] <webben>
nessy: Hence why the discussion has partly revolved around Natural Language Processing as an alternative.

[16:59:01.0000] <nessy>
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-scenarios/

[17:00:00.0000] <nessy>
has an example of 9 use cases

[17:00:01.0000] <nessy>
it's sort-of asking what is the use case for html

[17:01:00.0000] <nessy>
kinda difficult to destill the essence

[17:01:01.0000] <nessy>
anyway - i don't really want to get into the semantic web discussion - better to have that discussion with some semantic web enthousiasts

[02:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
ooh, the first kickoff was this weekend

[02:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me signs up to ref at the silicon valley regional again

[02:49:00.0000] <olliej_>
Hixie: ?

[02:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
usfirst.org

[02:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
though the "us" is a lie

[02:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's international

[02:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
(though still heavily us-skewed currently)

[03:08:00.0000] <olliej_>
ah

[03:08:01.0000] <olliej_>
i see

[03:32:00.0000] <cyclist>
It seems that if I have a <div> inside a <pre>, the "newline removal" applies for the inner div as well.

[03:33:00.0000] <cyclist>
for example: <pre> \n <div> \n foo \n </div> \n </pre>

[03:34:00.0000] <cyclist>
If you set backgrounds to the div and the pre blocks then the <div> occupies

[03:34:01.0000] <cyclist>
two lines.

[03:37:00.0000] <gpy>
anyone have spotify invites left?

[03:55:00.0000] <cyclist>
ok this is really weird:

[03:56:00.0000] <cyclist>
<pre> \n <div> </div> \n </pre>

[03:56:01.0000] <cyclist>
is exactly the same as:

[03:56:02.0000] <cyclist>
<pre> \n <div> \n </div> \n </pre>

[03:57:00.0000] <cyclist>
(everything without any text, just boxes with background)

[03:57:01.0000] <cyclist>
but this is hilarious:

[03:57:02.0000] <cyclist>
<pre> <div> </div> </pre>

[03:57:03.0000] <cyclist>
without newlines actually occupies 3 lines!

[03:58:00.0000] <cyclist>
is that part of the standard?

[05:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
google sure doesn't make it easy to file bugs on their services

[05:34:00.0000] <annevk>
what problem descriptions for the RDF thread have been tried yet?

[05:35:00.0000] <annevk>
is "being able to add 'arbitrary' metadata to HTML content so that machines can understand what is going on" accurate?

[05:36:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe I shouldn't try

[05:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/01/03/iCalendar-Validator#c1231033642

[05:43:00.0000] <annevk>
writing good specs is hard

[05:43:01.0000] <annevk>
and not just because of the politics

[05:59:00.0000] <olliej_>
annevk: heh

[06:13:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I'd say this Charles person is doing a lot of explanation of what RDF will solve

[06:13:01.0000] <jcranmer>
just not why we care

[06:14:00.0000] <jcranmer>
he also does a lot of "well, the answer is obvious"

[06:15:00.0000] <jcranmer>
after being asked the question because the answer was, well, not obvious

[06:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: wiki.whatwg.org has gone 500

[06:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the spec annotation script connects to a server that has gone 500, too

[06:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
why is http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#attr-meta-http-equiv-default-style in the spec?

[07:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: That's why I just complain about Google service bugs on IRC

[07:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ok let's try that

[07:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/source/browse/ has gone 500

[07:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(checkout fails with Reference to non-existent node '/.37722223df817abf.519887ccaff96edb.6c29f3f04d5d1dee' in filesystem 'jing-trang')

[07:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
(http://jing-trang.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ fails with that too)

[09:30:00.0000] <rubys>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MicrosyntaxDescriptions

[09:31:00.0000] <rubys>
wiki's down

[09:36:00.0000] <annevk>
forums as well

[09:36:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe CPU quota limit has been hit, Hixie?

[09:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
If the wiki is down, how can you validate a page that uses rel values defined therein?

[09:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It becomes a human-verified conformance criteron :)

[09:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
How can the human verify it, if they can't access the wiki? :-)

[09:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The human can go and visit the data center

[09:46:00.0000] <rubys>
The reason why I ask is that apparently I can't build hsivonen's checker without access to that page.

[09:52:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe get a copy from Google's cache?

[09:54:00.0000] <rubys>
this is the fourth thing fetched by the build process that doesn't resolve.  The second was from google code: http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/source/browse/

[09:54:01.0000] <rubys>
I mean, if you can't trust google to be up, who can you trust?  :-)

[09:59:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen was complaining about that earlier as well

[09:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
rubys: windows update!

[10:00:00.0000] <rubys>
Dashiva: doesn't help me much, I'm running Ubuntu :-)

[10:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can only trust your own machine to be up

[10:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
so what you should do is download all the dependencies to your own computer, and then you'll never have problems accessing them

[10:03:00.0000] <rubys>
I also tend to prefer fewer dependencies than Henri seems comfortable with.

[10:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe he reckons people won't find his site if google is down :)

[10:04:00.0000] <annevk>
dependency on wiki.whatwg.org should be fine, but it should not be fatal...

[10:14:00.0000] <annevk>
not really

[10:15:00.0000] <annevk>
though sometimes I do get through, seems like the CPU quota thing

[11:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: right now, I'm not comfortable with the wiki deps, either. :-(

[11:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: the wiki dependency is an app startup time dependency--the wiki is not consulted later at run time

[11:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess the wiki deps need the same treatment as the spec

[11:14:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the spec is not checked into the svn of the validator itself

[11:15:00.0000] <rubys>
how does the validator depend on the spec?

[11:17:00.0000] <rubys>
btw, I have the checker working.  I needed one more dependency, but as the dependency had a file name with 2004 in it, I figured I could get that from where I had gotten the checker working last year.

[11:20:00.0000] <rubys>
it looks like (a) this checker build process checks out all of the files necessary for the cpp generation, so I can get started with what I have got, and (b) unlike what I remember, the checker build process can be used to update an existing build.

[11:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: the spec is mined for UI strings

[11:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: if you run python build/build.py --help, it lists command line options for overriding the wiki URIs

[11:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I have forgotten to document some options

[11:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
--microsyntax=http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MicrosyntaxDescriptions

[11:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
actually, it's worse than just not documenting stuff. the build script can't override the alt advice URI

[11:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
given how easy it is for remote resources to break the validator.nu build script, I'm not very optimistic about the idea of UAs fetching namespace URIs at runtime to load OWL

[11:32:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, didn't DTDs tell us that wasn't going to work, ever?

[11:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I suppose

[11:34:00.0000] <annevk>
/me remembers some outcry over the Netscape RSS DTD going dead

[11:34:01.0000] <rubys>
this stuff should be cached, and tags with ETAGs

[11:34:02.0000] <rubys>
s/tags/tagged/

[11:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: do you mean the cvsdude repo should seed the cache?

[11:35:01.0000] <annevk>
can't the validator SVN carry a copy of the page that's updated from time to time and used when the wiki page is not available?

[11:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: yes

[11:36:01.0000] <rubys>
and furthermore, running instances should update their own private cache when they can successfully fetch the wiki page

[11:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: fwiw, the main reason why jars aren't checked in is that I don't want to deal with all the license compliance stuff that would come with distributing the binaries

[11:37:01.0000] <rubys>
/me nods

And as we're talking about how last week has gone downhill, it plunges into the swamp....

[12:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, it really isn't very good any more.

[12:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Damned Mr Last Week.

[12:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: I think you should set up your own Last Week-like blog

[12:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And call it Next Week in HTML5!

[12:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, if you're a teamster, you should be able to know what's gonna happen!

[12:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
Backdate all the blog posts, and nobody will ever realise that you can't actually read the future

People really like using trailing slashes in HTML5

[14:00:01.0000] <annevk>
http://adactio.com/journal/1540 mentions a bunch of HTML5 articles I missed

[14:01:00.0000] <annevk>

That obviously didn't entirely work.

all the focus outlines are turned off: http://forabeautifulweb.com/demo/2008/11/15/index.html

[15:37:04.0000] <BenMillard>
that's rather sad

[15:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
funny how things which actually help users, like focus outlines, are being turned off when things that don't help anyone, like classitis, are becoming vogue

[15:38:01.0000] <BenMillard>
although I wholeheartedly approve of his intention style :P

I'd find both interesting, it's just I'm probably less likely to get in for the joint degree :)

jgraham & annevk, I'm tried a more vibrant "web 2.0" pallette of colours for links: http://ben.local/!dev/whatwg-blog/

I think it makes the links complement the runs of orange code a bit better than #00c

it is inconsistent with the spec now, of course

It is fixed locally. The bug you found looks like stray debugging code so it should be pretty easy to fix too (but I don't know when I will be able to resync the live version)

[03:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me updates web forms 2

[03:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a process for adding the note to the W3C copy?

[03:06:01.0000] <annevk>
you can update the shorthand to redirect to html5

[03:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the /TR copy?

[03:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: done

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yes

[03:09:00.0000] <annevk>
it was more in reply to hsivonen regarding the /TR/ shorthand, but for the WHATWG one it makes sense too :)

[03:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: dunno, whose charter does it fall under?

[03:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: oh :-)

[03:09:03.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, is there a process for making the /TR/shortname of redirect to a different place once the draft has fallen off charters?

[03:09:04.0000] <hsivonen>
s/ of / of a draft /

[03:09:05.0000] <Hixie>
the w3c process is so heavy for this kind of thing, i don't really want to get involved in working out what the process is

[03:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
but feel free to champion the cause if you want to

[03:10:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, there's no process, you just tell sysreq, prolly easiest to do when we publish a new html5 draft and then list the WF2 draft as a previous version

[03:10:02.0000] <Philip`>
Why does the first bit of the HTML5 forms page list "Submittable elements" and "Resettable elements", but "Listed" and "Labelable" [not "... elements"]?

[03:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: editorial oversight. file a bug / send an e-mail / ignore it, as desired :-)

[03:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: no, unless you intend to add similar prose everywhere else that invokes another algorithm :)

[03:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: bummer

[03:12:02.0000] <annevk>
(the CSS WG did the shorthand change thing with the borders and background drafts)

[03:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[03:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
And about the stripping of lines that start with "*"

[03:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>

[03:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
but maybe with your name splet right

[03:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
stripping of lines that start with "*"?

[03:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: there is no parsing folder

[03:33:05.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: parsing issues are in the processing-model folder at the moment

[03:33:06.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: ok

[03:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wonders whether http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-October/007528.html got a reply

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't appear to be in my folders anymore

[03:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
so i assume yes

[03:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
we're having trouble with innerHTML roundtripping -- pages depend on the ie6 behavior that form controls don't lose their form after innerHTML assignment

[03:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: how do you mean?

[03:37:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: <table><form><tr><td><input>

[03:37:03.0000] <zcorpan>
table.innerHTML = table.innerHTML

[03:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do other browsers handle it?

[03:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
in safari and firefox the control looses its form

[03:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i can't find the reply if there is one

[03:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.google.com/search?q=%22I+didn%27t+consider+that.+I+see+the+issue%22 should probably have 2 results if there was :)

[03:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, let me answer it now then:

[03:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
making <form> into a table body wouldn't solve your problem for tables that contained table bodies.

[03:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
and it would be _really_ weird behavior

[03:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
since all but one of the major browsers don't support this page, i recommend evangelisation.

[03:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i agree it would be weird

[03:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I meant that (when I last looked) lines starting with "*" were stripped :-)

[03:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: that's odd

[03:45:03.0000] <Philip`>
but I can't find any examples because I don't know how to search for mails that have lines starting with "*" and that were turned into issues

[03:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: in the body?

[03:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Yes - I wrote emails with list items starting with "*", and the first line of each list item (i.e. the line starting with "*") was nowhere to be seen in the version on the issues list

[03:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: though it would work for tables that have tbodies (even though it's rare) by making <form> close tbody

[03:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
FYI http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/accessibility/2009-January/000272.html

[03:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: only at the cost of breaking the styling

[03:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I don't really want to run it on the html5.org server because I don't want to bother with having to install Perl modules and stuff

[03:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: good lord, captions shouldn't use JS

[03:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: but I suppose I could run it on my own server at issues.philip.html5.org/ or something

[03:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm inclined to think that the captioning browsing context should have scripting disabled. 

[03:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: there don't appear to be any e-mails with "*" at the start of them in the issues list right now

[03:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Well, there wouldn't be since those lines all got stripped out ;-)

[03:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: but it could just be that i never see the *s in the first place

[03:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i mean, my script doesn't see any *s in the raw data

[03:51:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: yeah but the combination of using tbody and form in a table *and* styling tbody in a way that would make a difference is so rare that it's just not there

[03:51:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Ah

[03:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: apparently the combination of <form> and innerHTML is rare enough that no browser other than IE supports it either :-)

[03:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: fair enough but we're still getting bugs about it

[03:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: other than JS, what's your take on overlaying a browsing context with a CSS formatter onto the video to implement captioning?

[03:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: i'm very reluctant to special case <form> here, it's a hack that my intuition says will cause far more problems down the road than anything it might solve today

[03:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it seems to me that if a shell document with UA-set innerHTML is used, the result would be massively simpler to implement in browsers than W3C TimedText

[03:53:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: ok

[03:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it sounds like trying to dig a hole to plant a flower using one of these: http://tinyurl.com/yqodhg

[03:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: having said that i do wish we had a solution to the innerHTML problem

[03:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I guess srt would be simple flower planting

[04:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but going beyond srt, what would you suggest? implementing a parallel W3C TimedText formatter instead of reusing the CSS formatter would suck

[04:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: have you had any bugs on other innerHTML weirdness in IE? like with what it does with mis-nested tags?

[04:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: my dvd player should not have to support <iframe seamless>, and my web browser should support the same timed text standard as my dvd player.

[04:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i don't understand where "formatting" comes into this. we're talking about lines of text overlayed at the bottom of the screen, right?

[04:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: your DVD player support overlaid bitmaps

[04:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: do we even need colour or italics?

[04:02:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: yeah we've had lots of innerHTML bugs

[04:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: would be interesting to have a list of cases that fail in safari/firefox also

[04:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: well, srt covers 99% of usage (text at bottom of screen without styling)

[04:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: i.e. cases the spec can't handle

[04:02:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: cool, that's 19% more than i care about :-)

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: sounds perfect :-)

[04:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the timed text WG has respecified the kitchen sink without CSS

[04:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the timed text WG's work will likely be irrelevant then

[04:03:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i think most of them would be solved by implementing an html5 parser and going with html5's innerHTML algorithm

[04:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: anyway, when one suggests srt, someone always has a use case that isn't satisfied. by induction, you end up with CSS or a poor replacement for CSS

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: if there are any that wouldn't, like the table-form-input one, i'd love to get a list, maybe there's something we can do to fix a bunch at once

[04:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: there appears to be a problem in the process you describe. namely, there doesn't seem to be a step at which someone is told "no".

[04:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is it your position that browser vendors should not implement native captioning capability beyond roughly the feature set of srt?

[04:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: ping? see above

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems sort of nice to have a subset of HTML in subtitle tracks

[04:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: do you have a reference for SRT so I could educate myself before answering that?

[04:07:02.0000] <annevk>
e.g. links

[04:07:03.0000] <annevk>
dvd players can just use a browser :) makes them also capable of running youtube and all

[04:08:00.0000] <annevk>
and following the links :p

[04:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#Sample_file

[04:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: doom9 documents weird HTMLish extensions to srt. I don't mean those.

[04:10:00.0000] <annevk>
"Unicode and basic HTML tags such as <i>, <b>, <u> and <font> in subtitles are supported by most players, but VLC (the nightly builds are starting handling them) and some subtitle editors (SubResync, Subtitle Workshop) do not handle these tags well."

[04:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fwiw, if you start supporting <foo>-like tags in srt, you are going down a slippery slope fast, and I'd prefer a well-specified format in terms of innerHTML

[04:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like srt is already in the RSS <title> hell

[04:11:02.0000] <annevk>
agree

[04:12:00.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: Hi. Was there ever any talk about the W3C adopting v.nu as the front end for validator.w3.org? It's a bit of a mission getting the W3C's validator to validate (X)HTML5 stuff properly. And I haven't even looked at file upload yet.

[04:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Because I'm a picky pedantic asshole :)

[04:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
deane: no, not really

[04:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Actually, it's more a case of I don't want to be to far out

[04:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>

[04:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i, a complete novice in terms of subtitling and timed text, would be surprised to see features beyond the following in a timed text specification: start/end time, full unicode support, device- and media-independent way of annotating non-overlapping, non-nested spans of text as being related to a particular class, _maybe_ the ability to indicate emphasis for spans of text, some mechanism to encode position, and some definition of the expected relationship

[04:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it seems that subtitle formats that aren't HTML+CSS are doomed to reinvent HTML+CSS in an ad hoc way

[04:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
subtitle formats that are HTML+CSS are almost certainly doomed to collapse under their own weight

[04:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Bad reason. Because 1) It's not really /that/ far out and 2) you'll likely be closer to Comp. Sci / Phy. buildings anyway (and and 3) because it hardly makes a difference when you're there) 

[04:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: It's certainly true it's harder than in Scotland :P

[04:16:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, if videos are primarily created for the Web and primarily rendered in browsers, why?

[04:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
videos aren't primarily created for the web nor primarily rendered in browsers.

[04:17:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, CSS would be optional, right?

[04:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I gave up on good reasons a while ago. I mean, whatever criteria I try and apply now isn't going to be what I'd apply after having started.

[04:17:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: even in browsers? with my suggested changes, implementing HTML+CSS captions can be done in terms of existing DOM operations given the anonymous iframe

[04:17:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: youtube is evidence to the contrary

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
youtube is a great example

[04:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: as optional as it is for web browsers in general

[04:18:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: For example I lived roughly by New Hall/Fits for four years and it wasn't a problem. Plus most of the central colleges have no space so their actual accommodation isn't in the centre of twon anyway

[04:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's streamed to the iPhone, to Apple TV, and to various other devices

[04:18:04.0000] <jgraham>
*Fitz

[04:18:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: having "[html5] r46 - This draft is now obsolete." as a subject for a WF2 commit message is confusing

[04:18:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Apple has a CSS formatter at their disposal

[04:18:07.0000] <Hixie>
and the idea of turning those devices into web browsers would likely horrify their developers

[04:18:08.0000] <hsivonen>
iPhone already has a browser

[04:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me always puts Fitz at the wrong side of Cambridge

[04:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Huntingdon Rd?

[04:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Anyway my point is that if you get pooled to somewhere further out that should not be a sufficient reason to reject it

[04:19:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Just off there, yes

[04:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I always want it to be on the south side of Cambridge, for some non-obvious reason

[04:20:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, e.g. I think it should be possible to extract the subtitles from the HTML and simply render them with default rendering for various elements (or no rendering at all)

[04:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: fwiw, my initial reaction was also against requiring non-browser players to render HTML, but the prospect of supporting W3C TimedText alongside CSS sucks pretty badly from a browser POV

[04:21:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, so if e.g. mobile phones do not want to use a CSS formatter they do not have to

[04:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and from non-browser POV, HTML sucks about as much as W3C TimedText

[04:21:02.0000] <jgraham>
Being able to trivially render the subtitles in a web browser does sound like a win

[04:21:03.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, then the only cost would be parsing HTML which is negligible

[04:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: having the features of html and css without using html and css is even worse than using html and css, but that doesn't mean that using html and css is a good idea

[04:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Oh well, I guess I'll see.

[04:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: a bad idea doesn't become a good idea just because it is compared to an even worse idea

[04:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it becomes preferable over the worse idea, though :-)

[04:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: there are more than two options here

[04:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Given the assumption that the desired feature set of subtitles will expand over time, it seems like a bad idea not to start out with something that is a subset of HTML since otherwise we will end up reinventing HTML, badly

[04:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
what jgraham said

[04:23:03.0000] <annevk>
/me agrees

[04:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
that assumption is a bad assumption

[04:24:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, why? it seems several subtitle formats are heading in that direction

[04:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
and that assumption assumes that the ultimate end point is html

[04:24:03.0000] <hsivonen>
but subsetting HTML in a way other than disabling scripting in the browsing context is more complex than just importing the whole thing

[04:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
why not assume that subtitles will end up being svg?

[04:24:05.0000] <Hixie>
then we should use an svg subset

[04:24:06.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, e.g. SubRip and W3C TimedText

[04:24:07.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: It's not clear to me whether it is a good thing, but it doesn't seem like a bad assumption. People generally want new features from technology over time

[04:24:08.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: HTML5 innerHTML implicitly imports SVG, too

[04:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: once the relevant bits of the spec are uncommented

[04:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
why not assume it shouldn't become OOXML?

[04:25:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, because currently they use HTML like tags and rendering rather than SVG

[04:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: because current evidence suggests ad hoc feature copying from HTML and CSS--not OOXML

[04:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
when building technology one needs to start from the problem, not the solution. it doesn't matter what timed text does when considering what timed text _should_ do

[04:26:02.0000] <annevk>
OOXML is also not really an option

[04:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
i think you are seeing HTML because that's what you're used to

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: fwiw, the HTML proposal flowed from trying to address problems where the problem space was defined more broadly than in European TV subtitling

[04:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: So, for example, people have suggested putting hyperlinks in timed text to link to contextual information about the video content

[04:27:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#Fields simply says "HTML"

[04:27:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, and has tags that are from HTML, literally

[04:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: people have been talking about hyperlinks in video for decades, but i've yet to see anyone actually want to click a hyperlink while watching video

[04:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Ogg Kate is different, but its implementation isn't suitable for importing into Gecko

[04:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yeah, and imho that's a terrible design :-)

[04:28:02.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: OK, I guess it's just a case of persevering with the present system then, thanks.

[04:28:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ttaf1-dfxp-20061116/#content-element-vocabulary also has tags copied from HTML

[04:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: why would Gecko need to do any of this? Surely the video subsystem should take care of this so it'll work in all video players on the system.

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, whatever, but we're not seeing HTML because that's we're used too

[04:29:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, apparently the people working on subtitles see a need for HTML features

[04:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Well it is a problem statement "link to contextual information in video". And if it is hard to do it's not so surprising that people haven't done it so much

[04:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: they have similar names, but that's about all that seems to be like html in that list

[04:29:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'm pretty much in agreement with you about what people need. However, I also recognize that creeping featurism looks inevitable and needs to be guided to a path that leads to least code duplication.

[04:30:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, they have identical functions, for one

[04:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
you don't combat creeping featuritism by throwing more features at the solution than will ever be needed in the history of mankind

[04:30:02.0000] <nessy>
ups, looks like I missed a discussion

[04:30:03.0000] <nessy>
/me reads up

[04:30:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: when looking for a solution for Web video, it's pretty relevant how it suits Gecko, since Gecko is a significant browser engine

[04:31:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ttaf1-dfxp-20061116/#styling-attribute-vocabulary is identical to CSS/XSL

[04:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: your definition of identical is interesting :-)

[04:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i don't understand the adjective "web" in "web video".

[04:31:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: video that the user primarily encounters through a Web browser

[04:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i don't know of any content that falls into that category.

[04:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
(and i work for youtube)

[04:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: How is Youtube primarilly encountered then?

[04:34:00.0000] <nessy>
I think you guys are vastly underestimating the use of time-aligned text that goes beyond simple subtitles

[04:34:01.0000] <nessy>
srt may solve 50% of the needs

[04:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
it is encountered in a variety of media and i think any current predominance of a particular outlet is more a function of ease of deployment than anything to do with that outlet itself.

[04:34:03.0000] <nessy>
nowhere near 99%

[04:34:04.0000] <nessy>
all of the video sites are starting to have annotation tags and speech bubbles and the like

[04:34:05.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: depends on whether you count use cases or use cases weighed by frequency of occurrence

[04:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
for example, if youtube was widely available on TVs, then people would view it there at least as much as on the Web, maybe even more.

[04:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
same with small devices.

[04:35:02.0000] <nessy>
since nobody has done an actual count, I don't think your 99% stands up

[04:35:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: how do you follow links from IRC to your TV to view youtube?

[04:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I've seen some TV programmes include clips from YouTube, which means millions of viewers each time

[04:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: most users aren't finding videos from IRC

[04:36:02.0000] <nessy>
if your tv is just a mythtv box like mine, easy :)

[04:36:03.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: ok. note that I quite like the HTML idea as long as it's defined to use the same parsing as innerHTML instead of something else

[04:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: The obvious way to deploy Youtube on TV would be via something like an embedded web browser

[04:37:01.0000] <nessy>
/me goes to read up on innerHTML

[04:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
also, i have to say that the idea of reusing the html syntax in another specification strikes me as a terribly bad idea, given how screwed up html's syntax is.

[04:37:03.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: for the ogg-muxed packets, that is

[04:37:04.0000] <takkaria>
let's use XML instead

[04:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: appletv isn't an embedded web browser.

[04:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
using XML sucks more due to the namespace mapping context when parsing fragments

[04:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and due to XML spec itself not specifying fragment parsing

[04:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
Why does it have to use fragments?

[04:38:04.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: your alternative is TimedText

[04:38:05.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, why fragments?

[04:38:06.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: alternative to what?

[04:38:07.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: For all its faults, HTML is one of the most widely authored languages in the world, so "too hard to author" seems like a weak argument

[04:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: for seeking 

[04:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i didn't say too hard to author :-)

[04:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: in the Ogg-multiplexed case

[04:39:03.0000] <nessy>
alternative to using plain-old html to specify time-aligned text

[04:39:04.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: for separate HTML files, the normal parse mode is fine

[04:39:05.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Well what is the problem with the syntax if it is easy for authors and easy to parse?

[04:39:06.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: but propagating design errors into more specs just because "well one day subtitles might need <iframe> and <eventsource>" seems like a terrible way of doing things

[04:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: it's clearly not easy for authors, given how widespread syntax errors are.

[04:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: but that isn't the problem

[04:40:02.0000] <nessy>
so you prefer to create a new spec that just picks the stuff that we currently deem as relevant out of HTML

[04:40:03.0000] <nessy>
?

[04:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: the problem is that it is an inconsistent disaster :-)

[04:41:00.0000] <nessy>
works fairly well for the web :)

[04:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i don't think there's anything in HTML that really makes sense for timed text tracks

[04:41:02.0000] <nessy>
what about YouTube's annotation tracks?

[04:41:03.0000] <nessy>
what about the speech bubbles you can overlay onto videos?

[04:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
(FWIW I would be fine with having a document conformance class for this use case without <eventsource> and other stuff that could be added later if needed. Of course desktop UAs would just use their ordinary engine so people might use those things anyway, but at least that would demonstrate a use case for them)

[04:42:01.0000] <nessy>
what about music video lyrics, that are displayed alongside the video and scrolled down?

[04:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: As opposed to XML which is a consistent disaster :)

[04:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: what about them?

[04:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i never suggested XML :-)

[04:43:00.0000] <nessy>
and karaoke

[04:43:01.0000] <nessy>
they all need some kind of formatting

[04:43:02.0000] <nessy>
and hyperlinks inside them

[04:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
They need a little bouncing ball along the words too

[04:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: HTML doesn't have formatting.

[04:43:05.0000] <nessy>
and background images

[04:43:06.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: and i'm not at all convinced of the need for hyperlinks.

[04:43:07.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: nor background images.

[04:43:08.0000] <nessy>
ask any advertiser

[04:43:09.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Sure but many people would 

[04:43:10.0000] <nessy>
speech bubbles are background images on text

[04:43:11.0000] <Hixie>
show me a successful advertisement on video and i'll reconsider.

[04:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: then argue against them :-)

[04:44:01.0000] <nessy>
almost all video hosting sites live off overlay advertisements

[04:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me has seen an overlay advert popping up on a video on YouTube

[04:44:03.0000] <nessy>
as much as banner ads and the like

[04:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: we'll see how many survive the depression :-)

[04:44:05.0000] <Philip`>
(It was really annoying and distracted me from the video for a couple of seconds while I looked for the 'x' button)

[04:44:06.0000] <takkaria>
how did we got from subtitling to overlaying ads?

[04:44:07.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Most films and TV shows are *full* of successful advertisments on video. Not ones you could obviously click on admittedly

[04:45:00.0000] <nessy>
overlaying ads are also time-aligned text

[04:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i rest my case

[04:45:02.0000] <takkaria>
right, but there are different use-cases here

[04:45:03.0000] <nessy>
since they are shown on TV, clicking would be a problem :)

[04:45:04.0000] <Philip`>
Movie teaser trailers often show a URL at the end, and it'd be nice if you could visit that without manually typing it into your browser

[04:45:05.0000] <takkaria>
one is ads, one is subtitles

[04:45:06.0000] <jgraham>
but I can see advertisers _killing_ for the ability to click on their product when it appears on the screen and be taken to their website

[04:45:07.0000] <nessy>
takkaria: they can all be solved with the same technology

[04:45:08.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Revver's business is based on putting hyperlinks into videos

[04:46:00.0000] <takkaria>
it doesn't necessarily make sense to use the same technology to solve them, though

[04:46:01.0000] <takkaria>
for example, subtitling is a fairly well-defined problem

[04:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: if 80% of people watching videos would at some point or other be actually interested in clicking on one of those links, then fair enough. i'm not at all convinced that even 5% of people would ever be so interested.

[04:46:03.0000] <nessy>
takkaria: if you analyse the cases thoroughly, you will notice that they have more incommon than different and that it makes sense to use the same technology to solve them

[04:46:04.0000] <takkaria>
and a format that tried to only cater for subtitles, it could do quite well at it

[04:47:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: many people click on these ads

[04:47:01.0000] <takkaria>
but if you want ads with speech bubbles and scrolling text, it seems like the kind of thing you just want to do using JS 

[04:47:02.0000] <nessy>
probably more than on banner ads

[04:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i'm not working on standards to support business models, i'm working on standards to help users

[04:47:04.0000] <nessy>
takkaria: javascript together with a time-aligned text spec, yes

[04:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: the entire movie teaser trailer should be a link, not just the url at the end. Put the <video> in an <a>.

[04:48:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: it's not about business models, it's about use cases

[04:48:01.0000] <nessy>
and we are talking about more than just ads here

[04:48:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: I'm not sure. It seems like Philip`'s example of a movie trailer with a URL at the end is quite reasonable and >5% of people would click on one of those at some point

[04:49:00.0000] <annevk>
we might use this for e.g. standards suck to provide URLs to the stuff we're talking about

[04:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: well, if HTML5/Ogg videos don't support insterting a linked ad, content providers will stick to Flash and QuickTime, which means users still have to deal with the badness of plug-ins

[04:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
(and on something like YouTube you don't necessarily have access to the surrounding page)

[04:49:03.0000] <nessy>
using innerHTML, CSS and javascript to solve the time-aligned text problem seems simple and elegant to me

[04:50:00.0000] <takkaria>
annevk: I would have thought it would be easier just to include the links in the post containing the video, no?

[04:51:00.0000] <nessy>
almost like a recursive function (from an elegance view-point) :)

[04:51:01.0000] <annevk>
takkaria, that would give away spoilers

[04:51:02.0000] <nessy>
takkaria: then you cannot have the links turn up at the time that they are relevant

[04:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i'd be willing to take that risk, frankly, because i don't believe that enough people care to make a difference.

[04:52:00.0000] <nessy>
it's not just about Ogg, btw

[04:52:01.0000] <nessy>
it's also about the external files that contain time-aligned text

[04:52:02.0000] <nessy>
if we get to a format that is web-friendly, web developers will easily be able to author them

[04:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway. Both the Timed Text W3C draft and HTML are suggestions that go completely overboard. One can provide much more than even SRT without going all the way to either of those.

[04:53:01.0000] <nessy>
so far, srt seems the only sensible format, but it is far too incapable for any richer need

[04:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
specs have to be built in baby steps, well-defined each step of hte way, only trying to address the 80% cases each time, if they are to be truly successful.

[04:54:00.0000] <nessy>
yes, the first web page was also far simpler than any current web page

[04:54:01.0000] <nessy>
that's why there are so many time-aligend text formats

[04:54:02.0000] <nessy>
each one with a bit more complexity

[04:54:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so from a POV of a browser vendor, the options are roughly: 1) use timed plain strings (original srt; no extension path without the RSS <title> hell), 2) Use W3C TimedTimed or derivative, 3) Use the CSS formatter you already have, 4) Use an unproven single-implementation format like Kate or 5) design a new non-CSS/HTML format

[04:54:04.0000] <nessy>
and with TimedText we have reached a very complex level for a reason

[04:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i don't understand why a browser vendor would ever have to even remotely be looking at implementing any of these proposals.

[04:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it should be implemented at the same layer as the video codec.

[04:55:02.0000] <webben>
IIRC the main problem with TimedText I saw was that it attached categories to text without enforcing any meaning to those categories.

[04:55:03.0000] <webben>
which was just bonkers.

[04:55:04.0000] <webben>
maybe they've fixed that now

[04:56:00.0000] <annevk>
nessy, btw http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/Timed_Divs_HTML#2._The_div_element says it matches HTML5 but HTML5 uses a point as a microsecond separator and not a comma so the examples are wrong

[04:56:01.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: almost nobody wants timed-aligned text inside video files

[04:56:02.0000] <webben>
nope, not fixed: http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ttaf1-dfxp-20061116/#metadata-attribute-role

[04:56:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you can't pick stuff that doesn't exist off the shelf

[04:56:04.0000] <nessy>
annevk: I created that page today! nobody apart from hsivonen has even seen it - wow!

[04:56:05.0000] <nessy>
will fix it :)

[04:57:00.0000] <webben>
/me would love to know what the difference between 'dialog', 'transcription', and 'caption' is supposed to be.

[04:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: what do people suggest happens to the subtitles when the user saves the video?

[04:57:02.0000] <nessy>
same as what happens to images and html pages

[04:57:03.0000] <nessy>
all go into a directory

[04:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: HTML5 has a microsecond separator? i thought we dropped that.

[04:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: and how do those subtitles get played when i load quicktime, then?

[04:58:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#times suggests seconds can have a fractional part

[04:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: oh, fractional seconds, ok. those aren't necessarily microseconds.

[04:59:01.0000] <nessy>
it depens on your player

[04:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
quicktime

[04:59:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Hmm, 00:99:00 is a valid time string?)

[04:59:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: basically browsers are now driving the need for timed text for Ogg, so browser vendors don't have existing Ogg stack code to reuse

[04:59:05.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, true, the conversion is indeed slightly more involed

[05:00:00.0000] <annevk>
nessy, ^^

[05:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: also, wouldn't you want to have the full Unicode goodness of Gecko for line layout instead of shipping duplicate code for it?

[05:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: so stop considering yourself as a browser implementor and just add the code to ogg :-)

[05:00:03.0000] <nessy>
the quicktime player is not as capable as for example vlc or mplayer, who load external srt and similar files to sync upon playback

[05:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the OS already has full Unicode goodness for line layout.

[05:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so would the Ogg stack merely blit pixels as far as Gecko is concerned? what about exposing the textual data to JS and AT?

[05:01:02.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, seems like a bug in the spec

[05:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: we don't need pixel-perfect precision for subtitles. Heck we don't even need the same font or color to be used.

[05:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: oops. i'll file a bug.

[05:02:01.0000] <nessy>
that's like saying you don't care if a web page author created a red heading - you display the heading in whichever colour you like

[05:03:00.0000] <nessy>
also, we really want to expose the time-aligend text so crawlers and other engines can deal with it

[05:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
crawlers can read movie files.

[05:04:00.0000] <nessy>
a web crawler should not have to

[05:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see why not

[05:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
my point with the subtitles is that subtitles shouldn't support formatting to that level of detail at all

[05:04:03.0000] <webben>
Hmm.

[05:04:04.0000] <nessy>
there is a need for it

[05:04:05.0000] <webben>
Captioning positioning may be important however.

[05:04:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: doing too much on the Ogg stack side is actually an argument *against* Kate

[05:04:07.0000] <Hixie>
no there isn't :-)

[05:04:08.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: what is the need?

[05:05:00.0000] <nessy>
and we are talking about more than subtitles - all other time-aligned text types that are similar

[05:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: partially because it doesn't do it on all platforms that Gecko does text on

[05:05:02.0000] <webben>
e.g. TV captions are sometimes in the video, not beneath or above it.

[05:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
webben: position was on my list of the few things i'd expect

[05:05:04.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: now you're just playing devil's advocate

[05:06:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Ah okay, by pixel perfect you mean what? text smoothing/hinting type things?

[05:06:01.0000] <nessy>
so to add to my above list:

[05:06:02.0000] <webben>
isn't that important to legibility?

[05:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i honestly don't think that there are valid use cases for formatting information in timed text, but would welcome contrary evidence.

[05:06:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Crawlers can't read movie files, because http://youtube.com/robots.txt says "Disallow: /get_video"

[05:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
webben: i mean, i don't think it matters what the line height is or what font is used, so long as the text is roughly in the right place.

[05:07:00.0000] <nessy>
it has been shown that captions that are formatted in particular ways (and there are guidelines by captioning organisations) will help deaf people understand things better faster and more in-depth

[05:07:01.0000] <nessy>
karaoke text needs specific formatting

[05:07:02.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Well. There either needs to be semantic information (different speakers) or presentational info.

[05:07:03.0000] <webben>
However, semantic info would be better, since then it can be formatted by the UA.

[05:07:04.0000] <webben>
@nessy's point.

[05:07:05.0000] <nessy>
speech bubbles need positioning and a background image, as well as appropriately formatted text

[05:07:06.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: sure, that's an argument for including particular classes of spans, as i mentioned; that formatting should certainly _not_ be hardcoded in the file.

[05:08:00.0000] <nessy>
in which file?

[05:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
the timed text data

[05:08:02.0000] <nessy>
so it should be in a css file and javascript accompanying this file?

[05:09:00.0000] <webben>
http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/CR-ttaf1-dfxp-20061116/#metadata-vocabulary-agent ... timed text can differentiate speakers at least.

[05:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: why does karaoke text need formatting? (and why do we need to handle karaoke? that seems like a rather specific case.)

[05:09:02.0000] <nessy>
it's one of the use cases, and not a small one in certain parts of the world

[05:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: what's the use case for speech bubbles?

[05:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: what? no css and js, please!

[05:09:05.0000] <webben>
Hixie: Showing who is speaking, I guess.

[05:10:00.0000] <nessy>
and singing along to karaoke, colouring words as their time comes is the best way

[05:10:01.0000] <nessy>
and speech bubbles are annotations - youtube has them and most other hosting sites have them - they add to the message that an author can provide about their videos

[05:10:02.0000] <webben>
Hixie: see also http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/06/youtube-annotations.html

[05:10:03.0000] <nessy>
people use them, so there is the use case

[05:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i have yet to see an karaoke video that colours the words in a way that actually leads to even half-decent singing, so if it's the best way, we're doomed.

[05:11:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: where do you put the formatting information if not into the text file hard-coded and not into css?

[05:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: people use lots of things, that doesn't mean we have to support them

[05:11:02.0000] <webben>
Hixie: They may be an improvement over just positioning the text in different places.

[05:11:03.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: btw, what's your plan for timed coloring? 

[05:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: in particular, i would not expect youtube-style annotations to ever be implemented using timed text features

[05:11:05.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: javascript? :-)

[05:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Subtitled foreign films often have positioned English subtitleish text overlaying the original foreign text that's encoded in the video, and those require reasonable control over position and size to avoid the bits of English text overlapping each other

[05:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: no formatting information. let the UA do it.

[05:12:02.0000] <nessy>
and the UA should get it from a CSS

[05:12:03.0000] <nessy>
it should definitely not fall from the sky

[05:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
good lord no

[05:12:05.0000] <Hixie>
the whole point is taht the formatting has to follow the guidelines

[05:12:06.0000] <Hixie>
don't let the author style it

[05:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: wouldn't you then need time-based callbacks inside the captioning browsing context, too

[05:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's a recipe for disaster

[05:13:02.0000] <nessy>
ok, let's stop all css and not style any web pages any more either - the guidelines we have for styling web pages are better than any author will ever do it, right?

[05:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
what guidelines?

[05:13:04.0000] <nessy>
the ones that existed when the web was created

[05:14:00.0000] <nessy>
ok, let's take a step back

[05:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wasn't aware that there were any

[05:14:02.0000] <webben>
I wonder if one could cater to UAs either positioning captions or providing speech bubbles by allowing content creators to specify origin points for text.

[05:15:00.0000] <webben>
I guess it depends on whether TV captions are positioned out of the way of the action or near to the speaker.

[05:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
regarding the youtube annotations -- it is far too early to standardise them. the youtube folk are inventing new things every week, you'd never be able to keep up, and they'd end up never using what the timed text spec supported.

[05:16:00.0000] <webben>
I also wonder whether it's possible to detect where the action is in a set of frames and position captions appropriately. I suspect not.

[05:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
they'll just overlap actual html or svg or canvas or flash or whatever on top of the video, with the data in a custom format fetched by xhr or some such.

[05:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I've now verified that Gecko with HTML5 parsing does not build on Linux at this time

[05:16:03.0000] <webben>
(e.g. superman flying - superman is still, the sky is moving, but you probably want to see superman)

[05:16:04.0000] <hsivonen>
(with the default build settings)

[05:16:05.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: I have spoken to the YouTube guys and they would love to have a standard available to provide them with the functionality

[05:16:06.0000] <Hixie>
who'd you speak to?

[05:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's not what i've heard

[05:17:01.0000] <nessy>
Ken and the guys around him

[05:18:00.0000] <nessy>
when they implemented time-aligned text functionality, it was a big question to use which format

[05:18:01.0000] <nessy>
when they implemented time offset addressing, they didn't know what to use

[05:18:02.0000] <nessy>
they are grateful that somebody is looking into standards

[05:18:03.0000] <nessy>
that's what I heard

[05:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
Ken Harrenstien?

[05:19:01.0000] <nessy>
also, speech bubbles for example are not just a youtube phenomenon - many other sites use them

[05:19:02.0000] <nessy>
yup, that Ken

[05:21:00.0000] <nessy>
anyway - we'll implement srt and experiment with other stuff

[05:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: why would it be less disastrous for sites to overlay HTML+CSS onto the frame from a script in the containing document than browser C++ code driving innerHTML setting on the overlay?

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: btw, is there a plan on what line layout code will be used for srt and what glyph rasterization code?

[05:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: because with the latter you are importing all of HTML and CSS into a format that will be reused outside browsers.

[05:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in the former, you just can't take the stuff out of a browser. how's that better?

[05:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it allows for conventions to arise and implemenetation experience to be collected so that the eventual standard can be designed sanely and with a suitably limited scope that still handles the important use cases

[05:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it's the same reason we often don't add features to html5 until there are cowpaths to pave

[05:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
video on the web is very young

[05:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
video annotation on the web is in its infancy

[05:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's one thing to be writing standards for things like subtitles, which are well understood and mature

[05:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
but things like timed annotations are far too new to be standardised successfully

[05:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: some use cases (captioning for the deaf) aren't waiting. if browsers don't deliver native support soon, we'll be stuck with JS-based captioning, in which case your goals about moving the video with captions outside the browser fail

[05:26:01.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: the srt layout question is unsolved at this stage - I hope to solve this with your and doublec's help

[05:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: right, that's why we should develop standards today for subtitles, which are well understood and mature, and which are incredibly simple to do compared to animated, interactive, formatted, web pages.

[05:27:01.0000] <webben>
Hixie: I guess one way of harmonizing this stuff would be to allow extraction of the data with the HTML5 video API, so you don't need to make an XHR call if you want to pull some sort of SVG/Canvas stunt.

[05:28:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: where subtitles includes captions?

[05:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
Most of the world does not distinguish captions from subtitles.

[05:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: what would the API return when the data isn't a naked DOMString?

[05:29:01.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: there is a huge gap between what the subbing community considers as good subtitles and what professional captioners regard as good subtitles - and it has a lot to do with formatting

[05:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: could you give an example of something where that formatting choice is not a choice the user agent could make?

[05:30:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: in fact, the part of the world that cares about captions, very much distinguishes between subtitles and captions, but let's not go down that path, too :)

[05:30:01.0000] <nessy>
in professional captions, you will find that different speakers are given different colours

[05:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: George Lucas uses yellow subtitles with black outline when the TV convention over here is to use white text with black outline

[05:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess Lucas is special and gets to master the subtitles where others don't care

[05:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That rebel!

[05:31:02.0000] <nessy>
so if a speaker is off-screen, you don't have to provide the name of the person (which incidentally may not be known) to refer to the speaker

[05:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: right, so not providing formatting choice would have improved matters.

[05:32:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: Depends what format is chosen, I guess. e.g. Timed Text DOM, or a DOM of whatever format Hixie has in mind.

[05:32:01.0000] <nessy>
also, if there are two speakers on screen talking fast, professional captions often create two different boxes with text and position them close to the person that actually said that text

[05:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: yes, my list of features did indicate that the text should be able to specify classes for each span of text, which the UA can then style accordingly (e.g. picked colours that the viewer can distinguish)

[05:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
<devilsadvocate>Should all Web documents be rendered in Computer Modern for consistency?</devilsadvocate>

[05:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: positioning was also on my list

[05:32:05.0000] <nessy>
also, when there is already on-screen text at the bottom of a screen, professional captions end up at the top of the screen or some place where they don't obstruct important information

[05:33:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: If you prefer Computer Modern, maybe they should!

[05:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: web pages and subtitles are totally different. subtitles are more akin to the <title> or title="" text, and we don't provide any control over those (and rightly so).

[05:33:02.0000] <nessy>
lol

[05:33:03.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: I disagree

[05:33:04.0000] <nessy>
10 years ago I would have said the same

[05:34:00.0000] <nessy>
but I have worked with professional captioners, I have created time-aligned text formats, and I have watched the Web2.0 space pick up on different types of time-aligend text

[05:34:01.0000] <nessy>
time-aligned text has almost as many requirements as web pages

[05:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
you have yet to give an example that shows that :-)

[05:35:01.0000] <nessy>
even picture-in-picture could be solved by having video inside text

[05:35:02.0000] <nessy>
video elements that is

[05:35:03.0000] <nessy>
but it's not something I'd advocate easily, since the synchronisation is a different matter

[05:36:00.0000] <nessy>
ok, let's take ticker text

[05:36:01.0000] <nessy>
ticker text often has images inside it

[05:36:02.0000] <nessy>
it has text in different fonts

[05:36:03.0000] <nessy>
text that may be fixed or run across the screen

[05:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
why would you put ticker text into the same solution as captions?

[05:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
ticker text has nothing to do with the video

[05:37:02.0000] <nessy>
because it is time-aligned text

[05:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
ticker text is pretty much exactly the opposite of time aligned text

[05:37:04.0000] <nessy>
yes it does - if the program changes, the text changes

[05:37:05.0000] <nessy>
if an ad comes, ticker text stops

[05:37:06.0000] <Hixie>
if the program changes, the video changes :-)

[05:37:07.0000] <nessy>
it is very much aligned to a segment of programming

[05:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
well in any case if we could kill ticker text forever, i think we'd have done the world a great favour

[05:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
so let's move on to the next use case

[05:38:02.0000] <nessy>
I have a whole bunch of other stuff that I'd like to put in that bucket - many html and css features

[05:39:00.0000] <nessy>
doesn't mean because we don't like it, the world doesn't need it

[05:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
please do send such feedback to the list, i'm trying to drop as much as possible in html5

[05:39:02.0000] <nessy>
blinking text!?

[05:40:00.0000] <nessy>
javscript that doesn't let you leave a webpage?

[05:40:01.0000] <nessy>
anyway ... I digress

[05:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ticker plus blink is the new blinquee

[05:40:03.0000] <nessy>
/me shudders

[05:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
<blink> is dead in html5 and text-decoration:blink has always been optional

[05:41:00.0000] <nessy>
good

[05:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
javascript that doesn't let you leave a webpage is as far as i know impossible, and html5 doesn't allow it (in fact it goes to some lengths to prevent it)

[05:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
(in fact <blink> has never been in any html standard)

[05:42:00.0000] <annevk>
<marquee style=text-decoration:blink>

[05:44:00.0000] <nessy>
I came across a spam web page recently that always brought up this dialog box upon browsing away from it which you were only able to say "no" on - had to do some firebug magic to make it go away

[05:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
might have been a browser bug

[05:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you come across it again, please do let us know the url

[05:47:00.0000] <nessy>
ok, will

[05:47:01.0000] <nessy>
thought I still had it, but can't find it any more

ah, here it is - http://scan4plus.com/22/?uid=165

[05:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
what browser?

[05:51:00.0000] <nessy>
had it in firefox and safari on the mac

[05:51:01.0000] <nessy>
it forces you to download an install.exe file, bascially

[05:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
i have no trouble closing it on safari

[05:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries firefox

[05:51:04.0000] <nessy>
I think it has a little delay effect

[05:52:00.0000] <nessy>
if closed immediately, it's fine - but after a while it becomes a nuisance

[05:52:01.0000] <nessy>
but I haven't investigated much

[05:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i waited and in both cases it eventually prompted with a dialog that i hit cancel on and then could close without issue

[05:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
but anyway

[05:53:02.0000] <nessy>
my cancels were ignored

[05:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
odd

[05:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[05:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
bed time

[05:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:56:00.0000] <webben>
nn Hixie

[05:57:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah - long past my bedtime

[05:57:01.0000] <nessy>
but at still 32 degrees, I don't really feel like sleep yet

[05:58:00.0000] <nessy>
nn Hixie :)

[06:02:00.0000] <annevk>
what do you call window.XMLHttpRequest ?

[06:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
window.XMLHttpRequest? :P

[06:03:00.0000] <annevk>
you can go stand in the corner

[06:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Seeming I have two working legs, I'd tend to agree with that statement.

[06:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
But you might be standing in a circular room

[06:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I, however, am not.

[06:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
There might be more than one corner

[06:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
You might be outdoors

[06:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
Or you might be indoors in a room shaped like a Klein bottle, in which case you are still outdoors too

[06:10:00.0000] <annevk>

/me doesn't know which way gravity is acting on him now

[06:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Gravity is down

[06:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Unless you are observing youself from a distance

[06:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No, there is a gravitational force acting on me in every possible direction, silly

[06:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds a link to a Wikipedia image in a (dead-tree) book

[06:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is quite user-unfriendly, and also seems rather a fragile thing to put onto paper

[06:24:00.0000] <gpy>
please whatwg, dont remove javascripts method .blink()

[06:24:01.0000] <annevk>

rubys: I think I'm going to try to relax GCC errors overall first before trying to do it on a per directory or file basis

[06:28:00.0000] <rubys>
relax errors?  Why not simply fix them?

[06:28:01.0000] <rubys>
My compile has started, I should be able to help shortly

[06:29:00.0000] <rubys>
annevk: ie8 beta2 shows ./support for both pages

[06:29:01.0000] <annevk>
cheers

[06:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: the error of jumping past variable initialization should actually be harmless and fixing it would mean hoisting all variable declarations to the start of the method and initializing them to placeholder values

[06:29:03.0000] <annevk>
that at least works the same everywhere then :)

[06:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I think the warning goes away if you just move the declarations up, and leave the variables uninitialised until the point where they're needed

[06:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
(i.e. you don't need placeholder values)

[06:31:01.0000] <rubys>
I'm getting what appears to be an unrelated error: /usr/include/gtk-2.0/gtk/gtkmenushell.h:117: error: expected ‘,’ or ‘...’ before ‘<expression error>’

[06:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
(except to the extend that default constructors would provide placeholder values)

[06:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: did you run the Ubuntu-specific build dependency apt-get incantations?

[06:32:01.0000] <rubys>
yup

[06:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
then I have no idea why that happens :-(

[06:33:01.0000] <rubys>
weird... restarted the build and it picked up where it left off and continued on.

[06:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: but if I move the declarations up in Java, I'll waste cycles zeroing the variables needlessly, right?

[06:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
not a big deal, probably

[06:35:00.0000] <rubys>
next error: /home/rubys/hg/html5parsing/content/html/parser/src/nsHtml5Parser.h:73: error: comma at end of enumerator list

[06:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: In Java I thought you could just leave stack variables uninitialised, and it's fine as long as the JVM can statically verify that you're not going to use it until it's been assigned

[06:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
in any case, I'm reluctant to move the declarations in Java, because the variables would be declared totally out of context of use

[06:35:03.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: already fixed in hg

[06:35:04.0000] <Philip`>
(and so it will just allocate stack space, which has zero cost)

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
(though actually I suppose it'll all be JITted into unrecognisability)

[06:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ok. well, then there's only the argument of losing context

[06:36:02.0000] <rubys>
hsivonen: is that a file that is produced by cpptranslate?

[06:36:03.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, the variables will appear less local to the reader than they are

[06:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: no

[06:37:01.0000] <rubys>
ok, pulled and updated, restarting compile

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: The warning also seems to go away if the variable is no longer in scope at the goto target, i.e. "goto x; { int n=1; }; x: ;" is fine, so is it easy to make your code do that?

[06:39:00.0000] <rubys>
ok, I think I'm now where you are:

[06:39:01.0000] <rubys>
/home/rubys/hg/html5parsing/content/html/parser/src/nsHtml5TreeBuilder.cpp:538: error: jump to case label

[06:39:02.0000] <rubys>
/home/rubys/hg/html5parsing/content/html/parser/src/nsHtml5TreeBuilder.cpp:488: error:   crosses initialization of ‘PRInt32 currGroup’

[06:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: would you prefer moving the declarations or telling GCC not to treat it as an error?

[06:42:00.0000] <rubys>
I'm still trying to understand the error.  Line 538 to me is not a goto but rather a label "default:"

[06:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
That looks like the label being goneto

[06:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: I'm seeing defaults, too, on the relevant lines

[06:44:00.0000] <rubys>
I'm assuming that the real error is "starttagloop"

[06:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that's possible

[06:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this can be addressed by putting braces around the affected statements in a switch-case

[06:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
eww. that looks ugly with my Eclipse settings

[06:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm trying to locate the relevant cases in Java and wrap the statement in cases in braces

[06:54:00.0000] <rubys>
cool

[06:54:01.0000] <rubys>
if there is any way I can help, let me know.

[06:55:00.0000] <rubys>
I've reproduced building the cpp from java (diffs from hg were nil at the time) and compiling firefox to the point of getting the same error you are seeing.

[06:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I wonder if I should just generate the braces around all switch-cases in C++ instead of using braces case-by-case in Java...

[06:59:00.0000] <rubys>
i see you've done a checkin... rebuilding

[07:00:00.0000] <rubys>
still see the errors

[07:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
committed to hg & svn. partial build succeeded already

[07:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I opted not to change the parser Java source

[07:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
instead, I changed the translator to insert braces

[07:11:02.0000] <rubys>
reasonable for now (at least until it causes a problem that needs to be addressed)

[07:12:00.0000] <rubys>
pulled, updated, and rebuilding now...

[07:12:01.0000] <rubys>
unrelated question: is there a high res version of http://about.validator.nu/icon.png ?

[07:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: I don't have one

[07:12:03.0000] <rubys>
alternately, how was it created?

[07:12:04.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: do you have a high-res version?

[07:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: zcorpan contributed it. I don't know.

[07:13:01.0000] <rubys>
if I blow it up, it looks like 8 line segments, but the underlying intent may have been different.

[07:15:00.0000] <rubys>
I guess putting it another away: if the image were to be scaled up, how would you expect it to look?

[07:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I would expect the top of the V to be horizontally straight but the tip at the bottom to be rounded

[07:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: no sorry

[07:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd expect the top left of n to be angled and top right round

[07:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and u to be like n rotated by 180 degrees

[07:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: ok. does my understanding of rounding match yours?

[07:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: yeah. the V is dark blue and the "nu" has a black blurry shadow with no offset

[07:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: ok

[07:24:00.0000] <rubys>
build is progressing, when done, I'll post a howto on my blog, complete with an svg rendering of the icon.  Feel free to critique and/or steal the icon when done.

[07:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: cool

[07:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: cool

[07:29:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, why is it hard btw to find start tags with (significant) trailing slashes in them?

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Because I'd need to write code

[07:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: and that code might have to be embedded in the tokeniser, which is not trivial to modify

[07:31:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, can you put it on a wishlist?

[07:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
unfortunately, I'm now back in Oslo, after a fantasic holiday in England

[07:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: btw, i created it in photoshop, drawing the "V" with a line tool and pixel-size pen for the edges, and the "nu" with the text tool with some font i don't remember and then shadow on the "nu"-layer

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I don't really do lists, since whenever I've written a list in the past I've never read it again :-)

[08:06:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, guess I'll just keep bugging you with it then :)

[08:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: now I've confirmed that Gecko+HTML5 parsing builds on Linux :-)

[08:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Nice :)

[08:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmmm

[08:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if there are any blog packages which store their data as Atom

[08:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=6357 ouch. that's not nice

[08:27:01.0000] <annevk>
toally agreed

[08:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
It seems like a different survey of web pages (with different sample selection) would be a generally good thing

[08:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
(also to enable different data to be collected)

[08:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: If you only want to look for one specific tag (like script), and don't mind missing any tag split onto multiple lines, then I could just grep for it fairly easily

[08:32:00.0000] <annevk>
if you could do just script that would help

[08:32:01.0000] <annevk>
at least for that bug

[08:33:00.0000] <olliej_>
morning annevk Philip` 

[08:33:01.0000] <annevk>

nice logo

[08:38:00.0000] <annevk>

[08:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: s/prerequites/prerequisites/

[08:39:00.0000] <rubys>
fixed and fixed

[08:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm. I need some language and UI that I can expect to run on any computer I am on, without compiling or installing anything

[08:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses Java would probably work

[08:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Java with bundled jre?

[08:40:01.0000] <rubys>
I could have done better with the logo if I wanted to go for fancy filter effects

[08:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: You don't have to exit all Firefox windows - you can run "firefox -no-remote" and it'll start a new version even if you're already running Firefox

[08:40:03.0000] <Philip`>
...though you need to choose a different profile

[08:40:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Issue: I don't know Java.

[08:41:00.0000] <rubys>
how do you chose a profile from the command line

[08:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I imagine you're kind of stuck if you're ever on a Windows computer, because they don't have anything if you don't compile or install it

[08:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: -P profilename

[08:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: Or -profilemanager

[08:41:04.0000] <hsivonen>
-P on its own starts the profile manager

[08:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, that's easier

[08:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: That's not an issue, it's an opportunity :)

[08:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But what is the probability of Java not being installed?

[08:42:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: 100% if it's a recent version of Windows and nobody has installed Java onto it :-)

[08:42:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Bundle the runtime

[08:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I suggest using HTML and JS and CGI, then you can access it from anywhere

[08:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me could almost do this with HTML and JS

[08:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me realizes other more major issues with making it cross-platform

[08:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: linked from http://hsivonen.iki.fi/html5-gecko-build/ ; thanks

[08:45:00.0000] <rubys>
when I try with -P and -no-remote, I get the profile manager.  I can create a profile, but when I select it I get an immediate segmentation fault.

[08:45:01.0000] <rubys>
for now, I'll keep with the instructions I've got :-)

[08:46:00.0000] <rubys>
being able to do this is just a sanity test for what I really want to work on... integrating with Python and/or Ruby.

[08:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What supports XML Encryption?

[08:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: things like SAML identity brokers, IIRC

[08:47:02.0000] <annevk>
rubys, sweet

[08:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether he could use Flash for what he wants

[08:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes Flash has the issue of being wholly closed

[08:48:02.0000] <rubys>
http://santuario.apache.org/

[08:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: So that's a library for dealing with encrypted XML?

[08:49:01.0000] <rubys>
http://santuario.apache.org/c/prog_enc.html

[08:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: from what I've heard, dealing with XML encryption and signing is painful

[08:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Without making up my own file-format it seems the only way to do this

[08:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
probably the runner up in # of over beer complaints after Namespaces

[08:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: Thanks for those, links, though

[08:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Making up your own file format might be sensible, since you only have to support 1 use case and not 80%

[08:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But if there are already libraries, like what rubys linked to, then it may be less effort to use them

[08:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: what's your use case?

[08:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: that is, do you really need to encrypt an XML subtree instead of encrypting an entire XML file?

[08:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: A diary on a memory-stick, which should be editable anywhere while simultaneously being encrypted.

[08:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That depends on whether the cost of learning the library, and the language restrictions it imposes on you, are less than the cost of simply writing what you want

[08:55:04.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: No, I can just encrypt entire Atom entry documents, so entire files.

[08:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: seems like a use case for an encrypted sparse disk image

[08:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: then you can use general-purpose crypto

[08:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I guess I'd avoid the issue of platform-specificy by having my own encrypting/decrypting stuff for it, but it'd probably be easier just to use something like tar encrypted as then I don't need to worry about OS differences about mounting images

[08:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe something like http://www.truecrypt.org/faq.php ("How can I use TrueCrypt on a USB flash drive?")

[08:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That seemingly requires to be installed, though

[08:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=traveler-mode says it doesn't quite

[08:59:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That says on Windows you need to be an admin

[08:59:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Everyone on Windows is an admin :-)

[09:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: At school I'm not :P

[09:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whatever happened to that idea of doing schoolwork today

[09:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: If you're not, that just means you haven't tried hard enough

[09:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Laziness wins.

[09:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
You're not meant to actually respect the security restrictions imposed by schools - they're just there as a fun challenge

[09:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Does the thing really need to be on a memory stick rather than an online service?

[09:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It being online means trusting someone else with my data :P

[09:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: not if the server is in your apartment and is booted with a crypto key that you remove after booting so that shutting it down makes it unbootable without key

[09:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: That sounds like too much effort.

[09:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It being offline means trusting everybody who has access to any of the hardware that you will use it with

[09:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
and it's probably difficult to have that much trust when you're in somewhere like a school

[09:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I hope the computer doesn't keep it unencrypted in memory for too long

[09:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
so, in comparison, a hosting provider is much more trustworthy :-)

[09:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: All they need is a keylogger

[09:05:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Another advantage of per-file encryption: if there is data leakage, it is minimalized

[09:05:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: A key logger will still get around online stuff

[09:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Set up a one-time password system

[09:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: And if I have the physical hardware on which it is on, then they can't get at it even with a keylogger

[09:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: If you have the physical hardware, you can install stuff like TrueCrypt on it

[09:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I mean a "memory stick" by physical hardware

[09:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Ah

[09:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I don't see how that prevents keyloggers from working...

[09:07:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It doesn't, but it means they need to get the memory stick to get at the data even with a key logger

[09:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Instead of just going to a URI and typing in what I did

[09:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: They can just copy the (encrypted) data off the memory stick when you've got it plugged in to the compromised machine

[09:08:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I do realize it can always be circumvented :P

[09:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: HTTPS + one-time password would mostly prevent them from going to a URI and typing in what you did :-)

[09:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: HTTPS + one time password where? :P

[09:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
s/where/how/

[09:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Other problem with online: it requires internet access.

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Just set up a web server with HTTPS, and generate n random passwords, and have the server only let you use each one once, and then print out the list of passwords and, uh, be very careful not to lose it

[09:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[09:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose the last step is a problem

[09:12:03.0000] <Philip`>
because if it wasn't, you could just make sure you don't lose your memory stick

[09:12:04.0000] <Philip`>
and then you wouldn't need to bother with encryption at all

[09:12:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Exactly.

[09:12:06.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, I'm unlikely to lose it, but I may as well be an asshole :P

[09:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or: Find/write a Java application for your mobile phone which lets you read/write the data (with a password), because nobody's going to keylog a phone and you're probably not going to lose it very often

[09:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But number pads suck for typing on

[09:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
You'll get better with practice :-)

[09:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees that a compatibility bug in Wine he reported yesterday got fixed today, which is rather nice responsiveness

[09:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And two years later, it appears in package repos

[09:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: The lag on Gentoo is currently about one month (and three days if you don't mind using not-yet-stable versions), so it's nowhere near that bad for me :-)

[09:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't remember how to simplify logs

[10:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
does ln|x-2| - ln|x+2| = ln|(x-2)(x+2)| or not?

[10:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is just being stupid

[10:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
No

[10:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
ln|(x-2)/(x+2)|, I think

[10:03:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks at marking scheme and sees he's made another mistake

[10:03:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That's still wrong because it's a modulo function, IIRC

[10:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Oh, you mean |x-2| like abs(x-2) and not just fancy brackets?

[10:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
In that case you'd want to calculate separate solutions for x <= -2, -2 < x <= 2, and 2 < x

[10:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I also realized I didn't actually need to simplify it

[10:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: yes

[10:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: http://philip.html5.org/data/script-with-trailing-slash.txt

[10:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me fails to see how \frac{x^2}{x^2-4} = 1 + \frac{4}{x^2-4}

[10:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sees now

[10:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders how we're meant to realize that

[10:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
(x^2)/(x^2-4) = (x^2-4+4)/(x^2-4) = 1 + 4/(x^2-4)

[10:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's just a standard way of rearranging fractions :-)

[10:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
Try to add stuff to the top so it looks like the bottom, and then things cancel out nicely

[10:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I saw that

[10:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's just a question of how we are meant to realize that

[10:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess we're meant to think that x = y + 4 and work out that y = x^2-4

[10:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
You're meant to have done some maths in the past, so you can recognise that in this kind of case you can simplify by adding stuff to the top so it looks like the bottom :-)

[10:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You see there's a 1, so you try to make a 1 on the left side too, and it just works out. :)

[10:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's just an instance of a/(a+b) = (a+b-b)/(a+b) = 1+b/(a+b), which is a simplification if b is simpler than a

[10:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, 1-b/(a+b)

[10:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yeah, sure, but I haven't done maths in weeks :P

[10:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds it strange that the BBC iPlayer appears to have the rights to stream some movies but [this is wild speculation] not to display screenshots of them on the web site, so the poster frames are unrelated images of the principal actor

[10:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
(e.g. http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b009lt62/The_Magic_Roundabout/ and http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00gbjh8/Dances_with_Wolves/)

[10:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, oops, I meant: http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/whatwg-blog/

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me unrelatedly notices that rubys's latest blog post breaks Opera's feed reader, because Opera scrolls horizontally to the end of the "java -classpath ..." line and does not display horizontal scrollbars and so the rest of the post disappears off the left edge of the screen

[10:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me really threw himself a the hard end of stuff going straight into previous exam qustions

[10:47:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, good to know. :)

[10:50:00.0000] <rubys>
You mean you can break Opera with something as simple as a <pre>?

[10:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: It appears so

[10:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: (though it's only showing a single feed entry at a time, so you can only break your own and can't interfere with anyone else's)

[10:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
it seems Opera 9 uses ul { margin: 1em 0; } when a <ul> is inside a <dd> whereas Firefox and IE have a rule like dl ul { margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; }

[10:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(Fx and IE are what I expected)

[11:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Would you mind if I said I thought that blog design looked quite ugly? :-)

[11:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually I think it's just the green that I don't like much, mainly the blockquotes

[11:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
If I remove the colours and indent them more then it looks better to me - the green box is just a bit weird

[11:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also the green horizontal lines are a kind of sickly colour - if I make them something like 2px #ddf then it makes me happier

[11:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Other than that, it looks fine to me :-)

[11:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I just copied the colours from the spec. feel free to put your own demos online

[11:30:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, updated the table inspector UI demo: http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/table-inspector/new

[12:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is realizing how much maths he's missed

[13:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How do I start Firefox up without my profile?

[13:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: "firefox -P" and then create a new one

[13:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
At least, that's what hsivonen said, but it doesn't seem to work

[13:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
at least in FF2

[13:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
but "firefox --profilemanager" does work

[13:08:00.0000] <jwalden>
add -no-remote to the commandline prior to the -P

[13:08:01.0000] <jwalden>
that makes it work if you already have a Firefox open

[13:08:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me rarely has FF open

[13:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Peh. This spec is badly organized already.

[14:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"Implementations MUST support GZIP [RFC1952] compressed ustar [IEEE.1003‑1.2008] archives. Exporters SHOULD create such archives." — is that clear enough, where "exporters" are defined above?

[14:18:00.0000] <dglazkov>
Hixie: so what would be a better way to modify render tree directly?

[14:18:01.0000] <dglazkov>
it's not like I am a huge fan of the spec-that-must-not-be-mentioned, but it appears to be at least going in that direction

[14:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it's pointed in that direction

[14:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
but it's not going anywhere :-)

[14:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
at least not currently

[14:19:03.0000] <dglazkov>
great distinction!

[14:19:04.0000] <dglazkov>
:)

[14:19:05.0000] <Hixie>
i told the csswg i'd be able to resume editing it in 2017 or so

[14:20:00.0000] <dglazkov>
Hixie: I can't wait that long. It's like 5 years or something :)

[14:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
xbl2 is the other way to have diverging trees

[14:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
that one has a stable spec, at least

[14:20:03.0000] <dglazkov>
ptr?

[14:20:04.0000] <dglazkov>
I mean URL?

[14:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.google.com/search?q=xbl2 :-)

[14:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xbl/xbl2.html

[14:21:02.0000] <dglazkov>
is that the shadow content part?

[14:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
right

[14:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
holy crap

[14:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
holidays are over

[14:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me wades into his inbox

[14:22:04.0000] <dglazkov>
(gut feeling) I really dislike this whole XMLsy cruft

[14:22:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what spec Hixie isn't editing till 2017

[14:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah xbl2 is rather heavy handed

[14:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really like the way it turned out

[14:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
not sure how i'd have done it any different though

[14:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: css3 content (and lists)

[14:23:04.0000] <dglazkov>
why can't I just go and add crap to CSS, vigilante-style )

[14:23:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: ah

[14:23:06.0000] <dglazkov>
worked for dhyatt, right? :)

[14:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
dglazkov: xbl is hyatt's brainchild too :-)

[14:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was just the midwife

[14:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
and then the doctor and adoptive parent for 6 years...

[14:24:03.0000] <dglazkov>
he seemed to have abandoned the child :)

[14:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
he paid child support

[14:27:00.0000] <dglazkov>
/me feels he can add simple and effective render tree manipulation with a handful of new CSS attributes and perhaps a few pseudo-selectors. This should really ease the pain of Web dev who now have to weave these shims and wrappers in markup or with JS.

[14:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
this is an area where we have to make sure we do things the right way, because there are a huge number of subtlties that make things rather complicated

[14:28:01.0000] <takkaria>
did hyatt invent the adoption agency algorithm, too?

[14:29:00.0000] <dglazkov>
Hixie: oh, I already kind of discovered this

[14:29:01.0000] <dglazkov>
I don't like "complicated" :)

[14:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
takkaria: a simplified version of it, yeah

[14:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
dglazkov: agreed

[14:31:00.0000] <dglazkov>
really, honestly -- I am not pursuing counters, quotations, named string, and such. I just want wrap,insert before, after, and move to. I'll go think on this.

[14:32:00.0000] <dglazkov>
+ clipboard interaction 

[14:32:01.0000] <dglazkov>
+ dom/selector effects

[14:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
well insert before and after you can do now with ::before/::after

[14:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
wrap would be ::inside, right?

[14:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
the move-to mechanism in the css3 content draft has more holes in it than a french gruyere

[14:34:00.0000] <dglazkov>
mmm... cheese

[14:49:00.0000] <roc>
this stuff is very hard to get right

[14:50:00.0000] <roc>
If you want DOM access to the generated content, then I think you'll head in the direction of XBL2 pretty fast

[14:50:01.0000] <roc>
we removed everything from sicking's plate so he can work on XBL2 in Gecko in the next cycle

[14:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[14:51:00.0000] <roc>
and isn't there a project doing XBL2 in Webkit?

[14:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
do you know which quarter will more or less map to "the next cycle"? I'd like to leave some breathing room for me in my timetable so i can have time to fix xbl for sicking when he finds problems

[14:53:00.0000] <roc>
Hopefully he'll start working on it seriously in Q1, and then it will be "as long as it takes"

[14:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[14:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
well my q1 is pretty locked down already with plans to deal with splitting things from html5 into the ietf

[14:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
but i'll make sure to leave room in q2 for xbl

[14:54:01.0000] <roc>
I'm sure he's not promising to have it done for the next Firefox release post 3.1

[14:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: do you know who adam barth should talk to at opera regarding content sniffing stuff?

[14:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me would guess that'd be slumped in with HTTP and therefore be Yngve (sp?)

[14:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It seems I did spell that right.

[14:56:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, it'll probably take a while before i have oodles of feedback anyhow

[14:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[14:56:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, there'll be a lot to figure out just to get XBL1 and XBL2 to play together nicely

[14:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to ask questions btw

[14:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
i just can't promise to do much editing before q2

[14:56:06.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[14:56:07.0000] <sicking>
right

[14:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
they're different namespaces, if that helps :-D

[14:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Q2 of which year? :P

[14:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
2009

[14:57:03.0000] <sicking>
until then i'll just do whatever i think is right ;)

[15:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: :-P

[15:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok bbiab


2009-01-06
[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i have a feature request to replace the earlier feature request

[18:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: instead of doing cross references across specs, i would now instead like to have a spec gen script that takes the same input style as now, but outputs an RFC-style text file

[18:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are tools that might help here: http://www.rfc-editor.org/formatting.html

[18:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
documentation of the format is here: http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.html

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
specifically http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-editor/instructions2authors.txt

[18:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: also, a template would be useful for new people using anolis

[18:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: yt?

[18:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yt? wanted to ask about whether you had registered or were planning to register the 'Origin' HTTP header

[20:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, everything in #wai-aria and #webapps for the past 8 days is status messages, including all lines marked important: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/

[20:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, almost everything in #microformats is status messages

[20:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
maybe the holidays last a longer than I think they do

[00:58:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, it is registered

[00:58:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, see the provisional header registry

[01:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: k, thanks

[01:16:00.0000] <annevk>
as for the content sniffing person at Opera, maybe hallvors would be a good place to start, but otherwise just contact me or zcorpan directly and we'll figure it out

[01:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, you there still?

[02:02:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I was wondering whether the "script context" thingy is stable now

[02:02:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, as that is what I need to use in XMLHttpRequest, right?

[02:03:00.0000] <annevk>
that is, I somehow need to define that window.XMLHttpRequest has an associated script context from where you can get the base URL, etc. blah blah

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: completely unstable, both opera and webkit have said they want it changed

[02:32:00.0000] <annevk>
nicely nicely

[02:33:00.0000] <annevk>
well, will wait a bit with XHR then

[03:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders what idiom "nicely nicely" translates to in dutch :-)

[03:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me replies to mail from november 2004

[03:13:01.0000] <annevk>
/me isn't sure, got it from Ideal (BBC show)

[03:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
odd

[03:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
what context do they use it in?

[03:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
i've never heard it before

[03:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
google doesn't seem to help

[03:14:04.0000] <annevk>
the main character says it when he's pleased

[03:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
aah

[03:14:06.0000] <Hixie>
odd

[03:14:07.0000] <Hixie>
the british, really, you never know what they'll say next

[03:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[03:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
ooh that reminds me, i have a top gear downloading

[03:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
i get to watch it tomorrow evening!

[03:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
yay

[03:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
i was so happy to see top gear on itunes

[03:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
back on topic, i wonder how to convert <datagrid> to an async API

[03:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: ping

[03:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, is that the original or current BBC series, or the US version of Top Gear?

[03:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
current bbc series

[03:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I've not heard of it. Just reading about it in wikipedia

[03:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
you haven't heard of top gear? oh my

[03:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's awesome

[03:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
and i don't even remotely like cars

[03:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
apparently there's a new Australian version that started last year

[03:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
though it's on SBS, and so even if I were in Australia, I'd be unlikeliy to bother watching it

[03:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems more like a TV show about people who are making a TV show about cars, rather than actually being a TV show about cars

[03:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
the reason to watch it isn't the show concept so much as the execution, and i doubt that other teams would get quite the same result

[03:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: right

[03:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
so is it suitable for people like myself with no interest in cars and/or racing, except for the annual Bathurst 1000?

[03:25:00.0000] <takkaria>
yes

[03:25:01.0000] <takkaria>
very much so

[03:25:02.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: pong

[03:25:03.0000] <takkaria>
it's suitable for just about anyone :)

[03:25:04.0000] <Lachy>
alright. I'll download a few episodes later and check it out, if I remember

[03:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
(One particular example is that they had a segment filmed in America, and introduced it by saying they only had visas for making documentaries, and the last time they were in America they were accused of having made an entertainment film instead, and there wasn't time to get new visas, so this time they would have to be very careful not to be entertaining)

[03:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which is a bit meta)

[03:26:02.0000] <annevk>
yeah, Top Gear is funny, didn't know it was still going on

[03:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: according to ken, what i was saying yesterday is indeed google's opinion; he thinks you may have confused his interest in captioning standards for interest in annotation standards

[03:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: in particular, we're still very much playing around with annotation so we wouldn't really know what we wanted standardised yet

[03:27:02.0000] <nessy>
ah

[03:27:03.0000] <nessy>
hmm

[03:28:00.0000] <nessy>
I wonder what I confused then

[03:28:01.0000] <hallvors>
/me isn't interested in cars and doesn't watch TV anymore either.. :-p

[03:29:00.0000] <nessy>
anyway - we all know we need to solve the simple case first

[03:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
hallvors: TV is much more entertaining once you remove all ads, trailers, previews, overlayed images, etc, and make it on-demand and limit it to only quality programming. :-)

[03:29:02.0000] <nessy>
/me gets back to it :)

[03:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: :-)

[03:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, if you're referring to the video annotation "feature" that YouTube has implemented, I really despise that. It has ruined so many otherwise good videos, because people abuse it way too much

[03:30:02.0000] <nessy>
no harm in discussing the future though!

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes that Top Gear is an hour-long programme and because it's on the BBC it's actually really an hour, not 30 minutes plus adverts :-)

[03:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders how <video> rendering in WebKit is threaded

[03:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: http://www.blogsdna.com/288/turn-off-youtube-video-annotations.htm

[03:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I always turn them off manually when I see them.

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i was utterly shocked the first time i was exposed to US TV -- if you think (non-bbc) british tv is bad, you should see tv in the us, holy crap

[03:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I've seriously considered stopping paying for the TV permit and getting rid of the tuner accordingly

[03:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: they play ads between the teaser and the first act, and between the last act and the credits!

[03:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, unfortunately, there's no way to have them off by default

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yeah it does seem that way, that's unfortunate

[03:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
too bad availability of online movie rentals sucks in Finland

[03:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why media companies are still region-limiting availability

[03:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
that makes zero sense to me

[03:35:01.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: get a digital tuner card and set up mythtv

[03:35:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I suggest using Giganews and Newzbin for your TV and film needs

[03:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
why would you ever explicitly _restrict_ your audience?

[03:35:04.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: I have a USB tuner and EyeTV

[03:35:05.0000] <Hixie>
then again, they also do drm and stuff, they clearly don't understand the digital age yet

[03:35:06.0000] <nessy>
and you have to pay for that in Finland?

[03:35:07.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: yes

[03:36:00.0000] <nessy>
:(

[03:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: like in the UK

[03:36:02.0000] <nessy>
not here

[03:36:03.0000] <nessy>
fortunately

[03:36:04.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, it makes some sense for the BBC, since ok UK citizens are paying their BBC TV licences, and other people would just be free loading off them

[03:36:05.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: If you sell something to a wider audience now, you can't sell it to them next year for more money

[03:36:06.0000] <Lachy>
s/since ok/since only/

[03:36:07.0000] <Philip`>
so you lose the opportunity for price discrimination

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it makes sense taht the bbc doesn't give away their content internationally, but they don't even sell most of it! top gear is only on iTunes in the US because it is shown on BBC America and BBC America has a separate deal with iTunes!

[03:37:01.0000] <nessy>
I heard this weird argument that audiences outside the target country would need to get different ads and so some sites restrict their region

[03:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's moronic

[03:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: why can't yet sell it straight away for more money? by next year, half the audience will have bittorrented it

[03:38:00.0000] <nessy>
we still cannot get Hulu down here 

[03:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: They sell it on DVD, but I don't know if they sell it on US-regioned DVDs so maybe that doesn't help

[03:38:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I agree that there should be no restrictions on selling TV shows, films and music worldwide

[03:38:03.0000] <hsivonen>
it's also moronic that iTunes rentals are available only in a couple of English-language locales

[03:38:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I think you overestimate how many people use BitTorrent :-)

[03:38:05.0000] <hsivonen>
which suggests that someone at Apple thinks that they couldn't offer untranslated content elsewhere

[03:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i doubt it's apple's fault frankly

[03:39:01.0000] <nessy>
it's usually the content owners (traditional distributors)

[03:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
do you mean content owners prohibit untranslated distribution?

[03:39:03.0000] <nessy>
they are not entering a new market without knowing how to commercialise it properly

[03:39:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: They probably want to negotiate with broadcasters in foreign regions to do the first showing (and thus get millions of viewers and lots of money from advertisers), which takes months or years to sort out and schedule, before distributing it online

[03:40:00.0000] <nessy>
I agree

[03:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
after all, once the content is available in the U.S. and U.K. letting others pay for it would be free money

[03:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
unfortunately, the way the rights organisations like the RIAA and MPAA, and their international equivalents are structured, retailers have to negotiate rights in each territory individually, which sucks so much. And they also have to consider release schedules on local TV networks, so they don't compete directly with their old and failing business model

[03:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so is it just a coincidence that the U.K. was the next territory after the U.S.?

[03:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i would be surprised if they got more money from ads on syndication than they did from iTunes sales to an equal audience. And if it's not an equal audience, then one still doesn't preclude the other.

[03:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: sometimes the UK is first, even (e.g. some babylon 5 and sg-1 episodes aired in the UK before the US)

[03:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
basically the entire media industry is aniquated

[03:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[03:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, when Steve promised "Internation later this year [2008]", I expected something more than just the U.K.

[03:42:03.0000] <hsivonen>
*national

[03:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, Australia got some TV series too

[03:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
i expect he did too

[03:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: You can't really broadcast a nationwide exclusive of some series if 5% of people have already downloaded it on iTunes and know exactly what's going to happen and give spoilers to everyone else and ruin the excitement

[03:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yes because national boundaries are really effective at stopping _that_ problem

[03:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I stopped watching series, because the broadcast distribution model just sucks for them--you have to capture the data at a certain time, and the time isn't stable because sports are allowed to go overtime

[03:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i recommend interning with some US company, getting a US credit card, and keeping it when you leave

[03:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[03:46:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, the fact is that refusing to sell content directly to consumers only ignores the fact that Usenet and BitTorrent are already catering to that market well

[03:47:00.0000] <hallvors>
even my sister uses torrent. :)

[03:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
I only use torrent when something isn't available on Usenet because torrents can be and are actively tracked by rights organisations, whereas usenet can't be

[03:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
my neighbours try to use torrent

[03:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i block it because they aren't any good at bandwidth management and it takes down my network

[03:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
(personally i just use HTTP to download tv shows)

[03:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Rights organisations could get the news servers taken down for hosting illegal content, and then replace them with servers run by themselves which log all accesses

[03:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
but they don't :-)

[03:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
(yet, anyway)

[03:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, if they were running the servers, then they're the ones providing access and they can't turn around and accuse users of obtaining illegal access

[03:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
I guess the main difference is that people get caught/punished for uploading content (which will happen in any P2P system), not for downloading it (which is all that happens in Usenet)

[03:53:02.0000] <Lachy>
but Usenet servers are protected by the DMCA safe harbour provisions in the US, and similar laws in other countries

[03:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
so what you're saying is p2p systems should be written in such a way as to be covered by safe-harbour provisions...

[03:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, yes, if that's possible

[03:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
that i want to see

[03:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
for the comedic value if nothing else

[03:55:04.0000] <Lachy>
like a Freenet-like P2P system

[03:55:05.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think I'd want to rely on a "safe harbour" defence when the service's entire reason for existence is to serve illegal content to people

[03:55:06.0000] <Lachy>
unfortunately, Freenet is a little too slow for such things

[03:55:07.0000] <Hixie>
bittorrent is used for far more than illegal content

[04:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Grokster served legal content too, but its main usage and reason for existence was to serve illegal content

[04:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
which seems to be about the same situation as Usenet binaries

[04:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: Usenet binaries can be used for distributing copies of perl

[04:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I can't run the latest IE8 right now to test it. Does it recognise unknown elements properly by default, or does it still require the createElement() hack?

[04:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It requires createElement

[04:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
(or at least I'm almost certain it does, because they wouldn't make such drastic parser changes this late in the process)

[04:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
(though I don't remember explicitly testing it)

[04:57:04.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: (https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=364356)

[04:57:05.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure we he thinks these new elements only address a narrow scope. The whole point was that these are the most common patterns authors are trying to find workarounds for using class names etc.

[04:57:06.0000] <Lachy>
/me responded http://alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=2#11

[04:57:07.0000] <annevk>
He also starts putting href="" on <li> suddenly which is not backwards compatible at all. And if is in fact demonstrating XHTML2 he should have used <nl> (or is that gone?).

[04:57:08.0000] <hsivonen>
http://twitter.com/adamcoop/statuses/1099359229

[04:57:09.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I didn't notice the href on li elements.

[04:57:10.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: The most common patterns are a narrow scope because it's excluding the long tail, which consists of all the individually uncommon but combinedly wide semantics people want to express

[04:57:11.0000] <Philip`>
<li href> looks more like a typo than anything intentional

[04:57:12.0000] <annevk>
Comment number 6: "As said above; a solution already exists; its xhtml with a custom dtd – in fact thats precisely what a dtd is for."

[04:58:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, fair enough

[04:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: do you happen to have data about Firefox 2 installed base shrinkage rate?

[05:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how automatically offered updates on Windows&Mac and EOL of certain Linux distros are going to affect Firefox 2 to 3 update rate

[05:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nn

[05:14:00.0000] <takkaria>
grr at that twitter update

[05:14:01.0000] <takkaria>
"begs the question" != "asks the question"

[05:14:02.0000] <takkaria>
or implies the question

[05:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Just read it as an abbreviation of "begs us to ask the question", which happens to be abbreviated to the same words as a different phrase, and then you won't have to get angry about it any more :-)

[05:16:01.0000] <takkaria>
only if you agree to not be pedantic too. :)

[05:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is begging the question ever used properly where "properly" is defined by prescriptive English pedants?

[05:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think I've seen it used properly once

[05:23:00.0000] <takkaria>
yeah

[05:23:01.0000] <takkaria>
in philosophy it's used consistently corectly

[05:23:02.0000] <takkaria>
my degree is philosophy and so I see it being used that way a lot

[05:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
eww. it's creepy to see my Google Code login on Blogger

[05:26:00.0000] <takkaria>
I heard someone say a while ago that if you hear anyone use the word "scientific" you should question what exactly it means because it often means nothing at all these days

[05:26:01.0000] <takkaria>
I wonder what would happen to the Web discourse if you did that with "semantics"

[05:26:02.0000] <annevk>
yay, Yngve will explain how keygen works

[05:26:03.0000] <takkaria>
for example, "We can’t expect any single solution we develop right now to solve all imaginable and unimaginable future semantic needs."

[05:31:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.rgraph.org/ is using <canvas> but also a lot of type="text/javascript"

[05:32:00.0000] <annevk>
habits

[06:44:00.0000] <takkaria>
I really want got write a reply to that ALA article, but it'd be a waste of time really

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=2#16 - "isn’t HTML5, at its core, simply replacing one fixed set of tags with another? The new tags might be meaningful now, but will they be in 30 years time?" - in 30 years time, we can have HTML9 with a new fixed set of tags that are meaningful then, so that doesn't seem a problem

[07:31:00.0000] <annevk>
and more "Boy it’d be great if this “XML” language existed along with support for “DTDs”..." in the comments there

[07:32:00.0000] <annevk>
I somehow didn't realize the rest of the world hasn't moved on yet

[07:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://dret.net/netdret/docs/wilde-cacm2008-xml-fever.html#self-description-delusion

[07:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
"Recovery from self-description delusion can take a great deal of personal commitment and effort."

[07:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I've always erred away from writing such a script, simply because the RFC format is so strict and has some many minor little rules that have to be got correctly

[07:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: There are also all ready tools that do this. Ask DanC.

[07:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: And I have exams starting in 8 days, so no.

[07:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(This is the "I'm not your bitch" statement.)

[08:00:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, lovely

[08:01:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, the funny thing is that e.g. http://alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=2#20 does realize it's problematic but is still arguing for it

[08:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, the usual Cascading Semantic Sheets are proposed: http://alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=2#16

[08:13:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, apparently the RDF community is seriously discussing that

[08:13:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, forgot where though

[08:14:00.0000] <annevk>
slightly sad that I said on my blog I'd lost interest in pointing out who's wrong on the internet; I prolly haven't, just moved the ranting to IRC :)

[08:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ranting on IRC or twitter is easier than writing coherent articles

[08:25:00.0000] <olliej>

[08:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me is now reading the ALA article.

[08:50:01.0000] <BenMillard>
/me thought nothing interesting had been written on ALA for about 5 years.

[08:51:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"We have simply run out of HTML elements and attributes with which to mark up more richly semantic documents." Actually, I think the problem is people forgetting how many there are and not being imaginative enough about how they can be used and combined.

[08:51:01.0000] <BenMillard>
"It’s pseudo semantic markup at best." that's all it needs to be...

[08:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ROFL @ linking to some random article about "HTML semantics" instead of the actual index pages for HTML 4.01

[08:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"We need mechanisms in HTML that clearly and unambiguously enable developers to add richer, more meaningful semantics—not pseudo semantics—to their markup." for what purpose?

[08:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Given the half-life of Internet Explorer, we can predict that most users will be using IE6 or IE7 even several years from now." Nice way to describe it, in terms of a "half-life".

[08:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"[...] the need for greater semantic capability in HTML [...] more semantic goodness [...] we still won’t have solved the problem." So, erm, just what is that problem?

[08:58:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The semantic web

[08:59:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I thought the semantic web amounted to publishing databases on the web so people could merge them?

[08:59:01.0000] <BenMillard>
and that the document web we have today would not be affected

[09:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"[...] the extremely important task of providing a mechanism for semantic richness in HTML [...]" But it just said semantic richness doesn't solve the problem?

[09:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"[...] we’ve been using class and id attributes as mechanisms to extend the semantics of HTML." and yet the article claims several times there's no mechanism to extend HTML

[09:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Let’s invent a new attribute. [...] we can add a class value to the element for styling." So much for HTML being efficient!

[09:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Instead of new elements, HTML 5 should adopt a number of new attributes." Is this part requesting for the data-* attributes which are already present?

[09:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: (I think it's requesting attributes where there is a global shared understanding of what their values mean, so that's not data-*)

[09:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though I don't know where that shared understanding is going to come from)

[09:05:02.0000] <BenMillard>
ah

[09:05:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, I know, it comes from DTDs!)

[09:05:04.0000] <BenMillard>
:P

[09:06:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, the author owns microformatique.com so those are just vanity links

[09:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, he likens these new attributes to class so maybe their meaning is not expected to be understood by UAs? Perhaps it's just to give authors a warm, fuzzy feeling when they View Source?

[09:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Like <invisible></invisible> to hide source?

[09:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: I can't really tell, given that his only proposed usage of the attributes is to make divs with a defined structure have bold text

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
The only real problem with adding new elements to HTML is the block/inline parsing differences, so what HTML5 should say is that if the MD5 of an unknown tag name is an even number then it's parsed as a block element, else it's inline

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Then, when HTML6 is adding new elements, it can just be careful to choose element names that have the right MD5

[09:11:01.0000] <BenMillard>
"[...] could be used to markup the rhetorical nature of a document." hmm, I wonder why that would be a useful expenditure of time+money at the web scale

[09:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
which isn't really a problem because there's plenty of synonyms

[09:11:03.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I kind of hoped unknown elements would work like <ins> and <del>, adapting to their context, but it seems that won't happen

[09:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Have you checked if that works for all existing elements?

[09:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: It works perfectly for all existing elements, because the new rules will only apply to unknown elements

[09:14:01.0000] <BenMillard>
the article brings up the issue of timestamps in title attributes as a reason to introduce a new attribute, when HTML5 already introduced <time datetime>: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element

[09:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Then it's a silly rule, because it restricts choosing the most awesome tag name for a temporary short-term gain

[09:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: How dare you call it a silly rule :-(

[09:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
It seems perfectly sensible to me

[09:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: You should create a new hashing function that works on all existing elements, that way new UAs can implement only the hashing and leave out arbitrary specific block/inline designations

[09:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: That should be easy - just use something like gperf

[09:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I want it on my desk tomorrow

[09:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
The problem with that is that I'm too lazy

[09:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Opinion needed: I have an English dissertation first draft due Thursday, and physics and computing prelims next Wednesday. What school work do I do now?

[09:34:01.0000] <jcranmer>
gsnedders: obviously, HTML 5 work

[09:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
I suggest you do none of it, and chat on IRC/Twitter/etc instead

[09:34:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me was somewhat tempted by those two answers

[09:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
By the way, you should not take any advice on this channel seriously

[09:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But also by working on a spec I started on yesterday.

[09:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't take that statement by Philip` seriously :)|

[09:36:00.0000] <jcranmer>
gsnedders: just say the computer crashed and destroyed your work

[09:36:01.0000] <jcranmer>
and you had to spend the next five hours stopping it from crashing ever again

[09:36:02.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, what are the prelims?

[09:36:03.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I suggest dropping any expendable work and getting the essential work done first.

[09:36:04.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelims

[09:37:00.0000] <jcranmer>
since it's in this channel

[09:37:01.0000] <jcranmer>
BenMillard can't be giving serious advice

[09:37:02.0000] <jcranmer>
so do the opposite of what he says

[09:37:03.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: All of this is essential.

[09:37:04.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: See the "Singapore and Scotland" section of that article

[09:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, looks like prelims are the more essential thing, since a "first draft" implies there will be further opportunities to submit the work.

[09:38:01.0000] <BenMillard>
alternative, just do as much as possible instead of debating it here :)

[09:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But the English is worth 40% of the final grade.

[09:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Nah.

[09:39:01.0000] <BenMillard>
well, the English is due much sooner so you could work your arse off on that now

[09:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes he has actually done more of it than most of his class

[09:40:01.0000] <BenMillard>
then work your arse off preparing for prelims after this Thrusday

[09:40:02.0000] <BenMillard>
but the important thing is to do the actual work instead of talking about doing the actual work...you aren't W3C!

[09:40:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: If the only result of failing to hand in the English dissertation is that you get told off and have to hand it in later, whereas failing to prepare for practice exams means that you will have forever wasted that opportunity for practice, then it sounds sensible to concentrate on the latter

[09:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It would however mean I have less time to do the English, which in the long run is more important than prelims whose results will never (unless I choose to) leave the school

[09:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That depends on how far past the deadline you can work on the English

[09:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs

[09:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Life is fun.

[09:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, if you can't make up your mind them flip a coin once and do that.

[09:43:01.0000] <BenMillard>
*then

[09:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That seems too arbitrary :P

[09:43:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is now reading RFC2616

[09:44:00.0000] <BenMillard>
procrastinating means you get nothing done at all

[09:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me is most productive while procrastinating

[09:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Not necessarily productive on the thing I'm meant to be working on, but it's better than nothing)

[09:44:03.0000] <jcranmer>
gsnedders: rand(1)*2 = 1.9150

[09:44:04.0000] <BenMillard>
since both are "essential", making progress on either is worthwhile, so a coin toss as a tie-breaker seems quite reasonable

[09:44:05.0000] <jcranmer>
do with that as you will

[09:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: Why not use rand(2)? :-)

[09:45:01.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: that does a 2-by-2 matrix

[09:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: Oh, crazy language

[09:45:03.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: it's MATLAB :-)

[09:45:04.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: I thought it was Perl, but I can see now how that's clearly a stupid thought

[09:49:00.0000] <rubys>
if they both are essential, do the shorter task first

[09:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
back to timestamps in the title attribute and the ALA suggestion for a new attribute...I just found a topic where I suggest custom attributes for this back in August 2007: http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=54804#54804

[09:52:01.0000] <BenMillard>
it was shot down by peers of the ALA author...nice to see how times change :)

[09:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
The computer science approach is to make use of the understanding of real-time OS task scheduling algorithms, so e.g. if it's possible to satisfy your tasks with no more than 100% utilisation then you can use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_deadline_first_scheduling

[09:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(zcorpan has been suggesting data-dtstart=timestamp and suchlike for about as long, IIRC)

[09:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ALA article says: "[...] a significant amount of work needs to be done to really develop a workable solution." That's already been done and it led to data-*, right?

[09:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: That's a solution for associating private script-accessible data with elements, not for defining the semantics of elements

[09:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. you can't write '<span data-datetime="2009-01-01">a few days ago</span>' and have a browser extension that lets you click dates to add them to your calendar

[10:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
because that extended browser would be non-conforming to HTML5

[10:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it's not a solution to that problem

[10:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, yes, that restriction would need to be lifted or softened.

[10:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: That restriction is there for a reason, and it can't be lifted without addressing the reason for it

[10:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
(The reason being that there's no mechanism for people to agree on the meanings of data-* attributes)

[10:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I imagine the mechanism would be the same as class values? So things like Microformats would move their class values to the part after the hyphen in data-* and UAs could choose to interpret them natively, or via add-ons.

[10:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
they could be managed like rel values using a WHATWG wiki page, too

[10:05:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(For the logs, data-* attributes are here in the HTML5 spec: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dom.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data)

[10:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: HTML5 had a mechanism for providing specific meaning to certain class values, and that didn't work well and got ripped out, so it's not a good precedent :-)

[10:08:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I guess something ad-hoc and communally agreed, like the Microformats approach, will be more successful than a central registry, then.

[10:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
But I suppose what's likely to happen is than a Microformats-like process will emerge to define common meaning to some data-* values, and they'll ignore that it's abusing the spec and that there's no reason to think it's not going to conflict with other people using the same name

[10:08:02.0000] <BenMillard>
indeed :)

[10:08:03.0000] <Philip`>
because the validator won't complain and it'll achieve their goals, so it's futile to try to stop them

[10:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ooh, ALA's live preview is nice, except it doesn't do linkification

[10:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hmm, it seems you can't make clickable links in ALA comments :| oh well

[10:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they haven't grasped the concept of "web" and hyperlinking yet

[10:26:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hmm, commenting takes me to a slightly different URL than clicking the permalink for my comment

[10:26:01.0000] <BenMillard>
anyway, my comment is here: http://alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=3#26

"The problem with namespaces though (and THE reason why they haven’t been picked up) is that DTD is not namespace aware"

[11:37:01.0000] <annevk>
the ALA comments crack me up

[11:40:00.0000] <olliej>
annevk: hmm?

[11:41:00.0000] <olliej>
annevk: (i'm not sufficiently well versed in xml, dtds, or namespaces to know the problem with that comment)

[11:43:00.0000] <annevk>
olliej, DTDs are dead, namespaces are too complex, XHTML is not supported by IE, the authoritarian tone of the author

[11:43:01.0000] <annevk>
olliej, it's several layers of awesome :)

[11:44:00.0000] <annevk>
also things like

[11:44:01.0000] <annevk>
"I think the main reason why “(X)HTML with a custom DTD” has never appeared to be appealing is because of the DTD switch – custom DTDs (AFAIK) run in quirks mode. This alone is enough reason why no one would use a custom DTD."

[11:44:02.0000] <olliej>
hehe

[11:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay for truthiness and resident experts

(the comment from Vasil Rangelov that is, in case they remove earlier comments)

[13:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: the same post also talks about XML Schema and XHTML 1.2...

[13:23:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah :)

[13:25:00.0000] <annevk>
it's something I could have written when I didn't really comprehend how Web browsers and the Web evolve

[13:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[13:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, iWork.com is interesting implementation-wise, but I most likely won't use it

[13:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: sadly none of the existing tools convert html to rdf. Maybe anolis could convert html to one of the other formats that is then converted to rfc? :-)

[13:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
er, s/rdf/rfc/

[13:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: DanC definitely pointed me to one beore

[13:38:03.0000] <gsnedders>

[13:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: (no rush, btw, please do pass your exams)

[13:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>

[13:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Also, it really ought to be an entirely separate tool. How xref is done for HTML makes no sense for text/plain.

[13:44:00.0000] <olliej>
/me seconds roc's question

[13:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: I haven't looked at the impl, but if they advertise same layout as in Pages, I'm intrested in line breaking fidelity and ligatures

[13:46:00.0000] <roc>
is it Web-standards based or a plugin thing?

[13:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know. I assumed HTML&CSS without evidence

[13:47:01.0000] <roc>
then I have no idea how they'd achieve that

[13:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: fair enough

[13:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
iwork.com claims to support only Firefox 3 and Safari 3

[13:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: on an unrelated note, it would be cool to have a template for anolis a bit like the template bert made, that happens to be w3c pubrules-compliant

[13:51:02.0000] <roc>
doesn't support IE?

[13:51:03.0000] <roc>
at all?

[13:51:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I also have no interest in writing such a thing, because xml2rfc fulfils my use-case fine, and I'm not your slave :P

[13:51:05.0000] <Philip`>
"For best performance and to use all iWork.com features, use one of the following supported browsers: Safari 3 or later; Firefox 3 or later"

[13:51:06.0000] <Philip`>
says http://publish.iwork.com/shareddocuments/?a=x

[13:51:07.0000] <roc>
cool

[13:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: What sort of template? Just a basic outline of a W3C spec?

[13:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's also interesting how exporting to Word can work in any satisfactory way

[13:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
last time I tried exporting from Keynote to PowerPoint (versions ago), the result was useless

[13:52:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Also: email me.

gsnedders: address?

...but they've gone to effort of doing things like <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" /> so I guess they care a bit about IE, and maybe it'll still mostly work in there

It's not really clear to me what we can conclude from that...

[01:34:00.0000] <annevk>
E.g. is it lacking detail? Is there a 100 pages devoted to different schema languages?

[01:34:01.0000] <annevk>
Do they use a page per namespace? :p

[01:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nothing to conclude except that it's a long spec

[01:36:00.0000] <annevk>
Previous versions of SMIL were too. There's a lot of stuff in there... I sort of hope we never have to implement more than the subset that is in SVG

I wonder how offering IE8 as a high-priority update goes considering that IE7 was supposed to be a high-priority update but IE6 is still out there

[02:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: since ie7 requires xp sp2 and there are users with windows pre xp sp2, i guess the ie6 users are mostly using pre xp sp2 and so will continue to be unaffected

[02:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: but most of the current ie7 users might well upgrade

[02:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>

[02:58:01.0000] <roc>
techie friend too

[03:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does XP1 still get security patches?

[03:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Well I built gecko with HTML 5 parsing and it consistently crashes at startup :)

[03:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: what platform?

[03:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I've used Leopard on Intel and 32-bit Intrepid

[03:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/imap5/current/msg00119.html - "During my recent job search, I was lectured that I had to get over this quaint notion that interoperability is important or even desirable. ... I have become convinced that it is hopeless to do anything in open standards beyond a general framework."

[03:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: 32-bit Intrepid

[03:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: interesting

[03:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Let me know if I can do anything useful to diagnose the issue'

[03:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: are you using a profile with non-default open tabs?

[03:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I created a new profile. 

[03:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
(it shows the profile manager before crashing)

[03:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: ok. It's hard to figure that out without a stack trace.

[03:12:00.0000] <rubys>
that's what I saw too when I used no-remote

[03:12:01.0000] <rubys>
and -P

[03:12:02.0000] <rubys>
with no options, it worked for me

[03:13:00.0000] <takkaria>
they're working on imap5?

[03:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
I also get a crash on startup after the profile manager (when running with -profilemanager)

[03:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://pastie.org/354574

[03:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
and it still crashes if I just use -no-remote (and not -profilemanager)

[04:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
but otherwise it seems to work alright

[04:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems incredibly slow at loading the HTML5 spec

[04:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
and I can see it redrawing the screen after every few words have been added to the bottom

[04:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it probably triggers O(n^2) behavior on the CSS side

[04:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm... <form><div><span></form><h4>

[04:26:01.0000] <zcorpan>
html5 says to close the form

[04:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the top 4 browsers don't

[04:27:01.0000] <zcorpan>
our rendering is compatible with html5 afaict but he have to change it because it breaks sites (bug with 13 dups)

[04:27:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: ^

[04:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
you mean the <h4> ends up in the <span>?

[04:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
cos the spec does do that now

[04:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: ^

[04:40:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, how would you link window.XMLHttpRequest with a script execution context so that if you do var obj = {}; obj.XMLHttpRequest = otherwindow.XMLHttpRequest otherwindow.XMLHttpRequest is associated with its original script execution context and not the one obj is running in

[04:40:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: oh it does? ok then that's good and validator.nu is out of date

[04:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me guesses html5lib is also out of date

[04:41:01.0000] <jmb>
hubbub certainly is :)

[04:41:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, the SharedWorker IDL block uses <code>

[04:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: yep (at least the instance running at james.html5.org)

[04:42:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, showNotification is still present in Web Workers

[04:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: no idea, like i said though, this whole area is agoing to change radically

[04:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: (please file a bug about SharedWorker)

[04:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
(or send me a mail)

[04:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
time for bed

[04:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Still wrong with the latest version. I must have missed that change and obviously we don't have tests for it :(

[05:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it seems that in firefox it's impossible to close the form with the above markup

[05:18:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and you can nest forms with <form><x></form><form>

[06:38:00.0000] <annevk>
heycam, does Web IDL define a way to define a prototype object, such as window.XMLHttpRequest?

[06:38:01.0000] <annevk>
heycam, also, does it define a way to say "interface X complements interface Y"?

[06:38:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't that the Interface Object?

[06:39:00.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, prolly true, now  that we have "NoInterfaceObject"... bit confusing with Window members though

[06:53:00.0000] <annevk>
interface object is defined in section 4.3 of Web IDL btw

[06:55:00.0000] <annevk>
does DontDelete imply you cannot overwrite it? because you can do window.XMLHttpRequest = otherwindow.XMLHttpRequest in browsers

[06:57:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess ReadOnly would imply that, great

[06:58:00.0000] <annevk>
/me tries to avoid actually reading the ECMAScript spec for now

[06:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: DontDelete only affects [[Delete]], not anything else

[06:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
(as far as I can see)

[06:59:02.0000] <annevk>
heycam, why is "interface Dog;" present in the first example of section 3.3?

[06:59:03.0000] <Philip`>
"DontDelete: Attempts to delete the property will be ignored. See the description of the delete operator in section 11.4.1."

[07:01:00.0000] <annevk>
ta

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/JSON_ARIA#Defining_the_widget - I suppose that's one way to get around the lack of comments in JSON - just make up your own syntax

[07:21:00.0000] <aroben>
hi everyone!

[07:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Howdy

[07:25:00.0000] <webben>
Philip`: I suspect those aren't meant to be in the final JSON. I could be wrong.

[07:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Comments are part of many JSON extensions, so it's probably not invented there :)

[07:37:00.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: Wouldn't they normally use something like // or /* */ rather than <!-- --> ?

[07:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Browsers have to support <!-- for (single-line) comments anyway

[08:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
hey brucel

[08:44:01.0000] <brucel>
hi

[13:58:00.0000] <webben>
cesar2: when you say "getting" to mean via the video API?

[13:59:00.0000] <cesar2>
webben: yeah

[14:00:00.0000] <webben>
cesar2: Something i've been suggesting to Hixie is that metadata in the source video should be available to the DOM API.

[14:00:01.0000] <webben>
cesar2: However, if you're including a video on a page, you're normally going to be able to extract that info and provide it to your page manually anyhow.

[14:01:00.0000] <cesar2>
webben: true. But I figure that it could be useful for extension developers for firefox

[14:02:00.0000] <webben>
hmm interesting point

[14:03:00.0000] <webben>
cesar2: Perhaps put together some use-cases and write to WHATWG mailing list with that suggestion? http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_the_spec.3F

[14:03:01.0000] <webben>
cesar2: I suspect Hixie's likely to treat it as a version 2 feature ... but no harm in raising the issue early.

[14:03:02.0000] <cesar2>
webben: I'll think about it some more. thanks for pointing to the resource

[14:03:03.0000] <webben>
np :)]

[14:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I have some vague recollection of that being mentioned at TPAC

[14:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I also have a vague recollection of Hixie thinking that should be added

[15:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
cesar2, webben: exposing metadata from the video is already on the v2 list

[15:15:00.0000] <cesar2>
what is the v2 list?

[15:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
the comment in the spec near the video section that starts "v2 features:" or some such

[15:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
every now and then someone tries to upload gigabyte-sized files to my data url kitchen

[15:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
qtf

[15:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
wtf even

[15:47:00.0000] <hallvors>
think I submitted a 1mb image to the data-url maker at some point (by mistake) :-p

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
1mb is fine

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
1gb not so much

[15:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me imposses a 100mb limit

[15:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
imposes

[21:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
some better ALA comments are turning up

[21:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
http://alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=5#41 and http://alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=5#48 imho

[21:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(Benjamin Hawkes-Lewis on existing extensibility mechanisms in HTML, then Ryan Cannon quoting the HTML5 spec of data-* attributes)

[21:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hmm, XHTML5: http://alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=6#52

[21:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(has an XML prolog and <doctype html> but <link rel="stylesheet" /> rather than <?xml-stylesheet ...?>)

[21:12:01.0000] <BenMillard>
(with a space before the />, XHTML-in-text/html style)

[21:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me just saw JohnResig writing about data-* attributes here: http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/

[21:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
JohnResig, how about this instead of data-* for that example: <b title="John Resig lives in Boston and likes to eat bacon">John</b> says: [...]

[21:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
JohnResig, or linking the name to a page which includes these (and possibly more) details: <a href="...">John</b> says: [...]

[21:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
JohnResig, perhaps you could show what an hCard for yourself would look like if written using data-* and compare it to the same thing done using Microformats as a more compelling example?

[01:02:00.0000] <takkaria>
yay for the Internet-Draft

[02:50:00.0000] <annevk>
webben, fwiw, there's no <h> element in HTML5

[02:50:01.0000] <annevk>
re: http://www.alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=6#53

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben: (it's spelt <h1>)

[02:51:01.0000] <annevk>
(those hyperlinks seem bound to break the moment they remove a duplicate comment, grmbl)

[02:51:02.0000] <webben>
oh, didn't there used to be?

[02:51:03.0000] <annevk>
nope

[02:51:04.0000] <webben>
oh okay.

[02:52:00.0000] <webben>
/me will write a correction.

[02:54:00.0000] <webben>
it's correct to say that the heading algorithm has been redefined to allow h1 to solve the problems I mention, right?

[02:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
<section> with <h1> solves the problem of content syndication where you don't know what level heading to use ahead of time

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's really the only thing i was trying to solve with it, though it does effectively solve <h7> and copy-and-paste as well

[02:56:01.0000] <webben>
cool

[02:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thinks that if your document has more than six nested levels of headings, you should probably think about simplifying your document :-)

[02:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[02:57:02.0000] <webben>
Generally true, yes.

[03:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'd guess most existing uses of <h6> come from people wanting headings with a very small font, rather than people who've already used all of <h1>-<h5>)

[03:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
The use case for h6 is shifting down heading when creating a compilation of documents that have h1-h5

[03:04:00.0000] <webben>
/me issues his correction. Thanks for catching that Hixie and annevk .

[03:20:00.0000] <webben>
/me is puzzled by how XHTML2's modularity magics away it's deviations from how test/html needs to be parsed. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/2009Jan/0015.html

[03:20:01.0000] <webben>
*its

[03:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hmm. Windows 7 beta tomorrow. I wonder if it installs under Parallels.

[03:34:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, " XXX * simple color picker" is done

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah several a re done

[03:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'll probably go through the list in late february or march

[03:35:00.0000] <annevk>
k

[03:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. the promo video listing new exciting features of Windows 7 lists features of which all but one are already in Mac OS X...

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the missing one?

[03:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: a window that tells you about the features of your device when you plug it in

[03:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
o_O

[03:37:03.0000] <hsivonen>
(I'm not sure that's a feature I want to have.)

[03:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
device being a device other than the PC itself, that is

[03:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
furthest block always stays on the stack, it seems. right?

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
the root one? yeah

[03:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
pretty sure

[03:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I mean "furthest block" in AAA

[03:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[03:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't claim to know anything about AAA

[03:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I assume "common ancestor" stays on the stack as well

[03:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. it *looks* like the local variables that are initialized by assigning from the stack or the list are all effectively weak references

[03:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I sure hope my analysis is correct.

[03:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
put a comment to that effect there so that when debugging you have a lead

[03:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I put "// weak ref" after each one

[03:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i meant something like "I believe all these weak refs are correct, but if this is crashing around here, maybe my analysis is wrong" or some such :-)

[03:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. done

[04:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
bah, the Windows 7 beta requires Vista to begin with. 

[04:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: What says that?

[04:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: All I can see is it only upgrades from Win Vista SP1

[04:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: I thought it meant upgrading was the only supported mode of installation

[04:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: is that not the case?

[04:28:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I'm not sure. I think it's a question of how you read it.

[04:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: "you can most certainly do a clean install of the Windows 7 Beta"

[04:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: From comments of the Win7 blog

[04:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: ok.

[06:39:00.0000] <takkaria>
does anyone know of something like a <canvas> interactive interpreter?

[06:39:01.0000] <takkaria>

http://twitter.com/threedaymonk/statuses/1104618551 welcome to the interwebs

[09:40:00.0000] <webben>
Does anyone know the current story on incorporating MathML/SVG into text/html? Is the effort dead, deferred to a future version, low priority, or what?

[09:40:01.0000] <olliej>
annevk: hehehe

[09:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
webben: MathML is in current draft; SVG is awaiting action from SVG WG.

[09:41:01.0000] <webben>
it's in the draft now?

[09:41:02.0000] <gsnedders>
webben: (Hixie's original proposal for SVG is in the draft, just commented out)

[09:41:03.0000] <gsnedders>
webben: yeah

[09:41:04.0000] <webben>
/me really needs to start following the draft via CVS again.

[09:41:05.0000] <webben>
gsnedders: thanks :)

[09:41:06.0000] <Philip`>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/html5-gecko-build/ has a browser implementation with MathML and SVG support in text/html

[09:42:00.0000] <webben>
thanks Philip`

[09:48:00.0000] <webben>
If I'm reading the draft right, it's basically just <math><!-- paste XML MathML here? --></math> ?

[09:49:00.0000] <annevk>
well, XML without prefixes or namespaces, but yeah

[10:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
webben, you are Benjamin Hawkes-Lewis?

[10:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: I committed code for releasing memory in the HTML5 parser earlier today. I expect the code for releasing element nodes to change in the future to make it possible to dispatch memory release request to a different thread.

[10:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
s/request/requests/

[10:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: I hope the code for releasing local names can remain as-is. I'll have to check if atoms are thread-safe in Gecko.

[10:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I'm not really satisfied with the manual nature of the memory management and having to know where stuff gets released, but alternatives seemed like overkills.)

[10:43:00.0000] <rubys>
I've only just gotten back to looking at the code, the first assumption that the code makes is that unicode is stored as utf-16.

[10:44:00.0000] <rubys>
For Ruby, at least, I'd like to use utf-8.

[10:45:00.0000] <rubys>
My immediate plans at to try to compile the generated code outside of Mozilla, stubbing everything I need to to get it to compile (not execute or even link, simply compile).  That will give me an initial list of things I need to worry about.

[10:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should write some kind of document pointing out the memory ownership assumptions

[10:49:00.0000] <rubys>
don't worry too much about it, I'll discover what I need to from the code, when I see things that need addressed, I'll discuss them with you, and then over time we will evolve this into something that can handle multiple environments... at that point documentation would be helpful.

[11:10:00.0000] <takkaria>
rubys: there is a C HTML5 parser around which assumes UTF-8 :)

[11:13:00.0000] <rubys>
takkaria: url?

[11:14:01.0000] <takkaria>

[11:14:02.0000] <takkaria>
it hasn't had a formal release yet either

[11:14:03.0000] <takkaria>
but it is being used as a parser in a browser for minority OSs

[11:38:00.0000] <smedero>
whatwg has almost always referred to it as HTML5

[11:38:01.0000] <smedero>
and w3c has almost said HTML 5

[11:38:02.0000] <smedero>
why that needs to be corrected in an wikipedia article is beyond me

[11:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
smedero: it's a convenient way to also brush off the observation that XHTML 1.2 is not chartered

[11:40:00.0000] <hober>
whatever happened to xhtml2 rebranding?

[11:40:01.0000] <smedero>
indeed

[11:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: No, we haven't.

[11:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, and changing xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2002/06/xhtml2/" to xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"

[11:42:00.0000] <smedero>
i see that the whatwg specs do in fact have the space as well

[11:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: WHATWG has for years called it Web Applications 1.0, and the combination of that with WF2 has often been called "HTML 5". The spec noted it was often called that too

[11:42:02.0000] <smedero>
though I swore they didnt always

[11:42:03.0000] <smedero>
not that this matters one damn bit

[11:42:04.0000] <smedero>
hober: that's a great question... I was lead to believe that a consensus had been reached in 2007 to undertake that work...

[11:42:05.0000] <smedero>
(within the w3c)

[11:42:06.0000] <smedero>
perhaps i misunderstood

[11:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, I'm also confused by the removal of .xml when .html and .htm are retained.

[11:44:00.0000] <smedero>
huh, what happened to: http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml12

[11:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: AFAIK they never published a WD…

[11:45:00.0000] <smedero>
yeah but there were editor's draft...

[11:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
smedero: That won't be a TR

[11:45:02.0000] <smedero>
ahh

[11:45:03.0000] <smedero>
then the editor's draft is wrong

[11:45:04.0000] <smedero>
as it points to that URL

[11:45:05.0000] <gsnedders>
what ED?

[11:46:00.0000] <smedero>
well there this: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2008/ED-xhtml12-20081023/xhtml12.html

[11:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, the latest stable version link always points to such a URL even when it doesn't exist

[11:46:02.0000] <smedero>
there's actually a newer one here: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2008/ED-xhtml12-20081223/

[11:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
they removed the flaming subtitle, it seems

[11:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
what subtitle?

[11:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: meaningful, accessible XHTML

[11:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
or something like that

[11:48:03.0000] <gsnedders>
ah

[11:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, there's a section in the Talk page on the Wikipedia article about that, too: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:XHTML#Change_title_for_XHTML_1.2

[11:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
it lists the entry on this page as how you find the XHTML 1.2 draft: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Drafts/#xhtml12

[11:55:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(the date is what you click to get the spec)

[11:56:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hmm, XHTML Media Types updated: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2009/ED-xhtml-media-types-20090107/

[12:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs a word that means "not introspection".

[12:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: How about using two words?

[12:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No.

[12:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
extraspection? :-)

[12:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, what's the context?

[12:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
Introspectionless?

[12:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: It's s/a/o/, but no, that's still more specific. There are things that are neither.

[12:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
Antiintrospectionarianism?

[12:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: tag for blog, to separate display of posts on the home page up

[12:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: (Most of those tagged with introspection are also tagged with lust :))

[12:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
outgoing?

[12:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: That too leaves things that are neither

[12:12:02.0000] <BenMillard>
I think I understand what you're trying to convey and are similarly struggling to figure out the word. :)

[12:12:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(think of code, that isn't really observing anything)

[12:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/introspection :)

[12:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Anything that isn't that.

[12:13:02.0000] <BenMillard>
perhaps the absence of the introspection tag is sufficient to indicate it is "not introspection"?

[12:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Then I have the issue of a column header.

[12:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, do you have a demo page with placeholder text for it I could see?

[12:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: does sftp://gsnedders:/dev/head work for you? :)

[12:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I may have uninstalled the only app I had which supported sftp...

[12:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Then you have the issue of reading my head, though.

[12:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks BenMillard missed the joke

[12:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me gives up.

[12:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me tries to come up with a sample of what he wants, then realizes he can't decide how to mark it up ;P

[12:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Should post+summary be marked up in a dl?

[12:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: http://secret.gsnedders.com/g6/home.html

[13:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, <dl> makes sense there as it's a list of title+summary pairs.

[13:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that was my conclusion

[13:08:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Extrospection" seems to work in the context of it being a personal blog of a geeky person.

[13:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: text in the top left corner overlaps other text

[13:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Yeah, I know there are issues.

[13:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Heck, it's almost completely broken in Firefox, yet alone IE)

[13:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, your current blog is like that in Fx2 (which is what I use)

[13:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Screenshot?

[13:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/temp/g-fx2.png

[13:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Um, that's odd.

[13:15:02.0000] <BenMillard>
I think it's to do with parsing unknown block-level tags

[13:15:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah.

[13:15:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me continues to ignore Fx2 :)

[13:19:00.0000] <BenMillard>
/me returns to ignoring gnsedders's blog. :P

[13:20:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hmm, lunchtime

[13:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
lunchtime? :\

[13:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders where BenMillard

[13:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
is

[13:35:00.0000] <smedero>
at lunch?

[14:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. no border-radius in Opera 10 :-(

[14:58:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: no -o-border-radius?

[15:13:00.0000] <maodun>
Looking at the python version of html5lib - why do some of the entity names in constants.py not have versions which are without trailing semicolons. E.g., why do we gracefully parse "&Egrave" as "&Egrave;" but not "&Lambda" as "&Lambda;"?

[15:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: no, it seems it's not supported with -o-, either

[15:14:00.0000] <takkaria>
maodun: that's what the spec says

[15:14:01.0000] <takkaria>
maodun: some of them only work in attribute values for compat with IE, I believe

[15:14:02.0000] <takkaria>
or the other way round.  I can't remmber

[15:14:03.0000] <takkaria>
anyway, it's IE-compat stuff

[15:15:00.0000] <maodun>
takkaria: ah, now I understand.  thank you.

[15:20:00.0000] <maodun>
takkaria: actually, wait - so is the goal not to produce a very robust real-world parser but rather to reproduce the behavior of commonly used browsers? or is the assumption that reproducing the behavior of commonly used browsers will produce a very robust real-world parser?  my intution would be that parsing &Lambda as &Lambda; would be the more robust solution, regardless of what IE does. 

[15:22:00.0000] <takkaria>
depends what you mean by robust

[15:22:01.0000] <takkaria>
if you mean handling existing content as people expect it to be handled

[15:22:02.0000] <takkaria>
then html5lib is pretty robust

[15:23:00.0000] <maodun>
that is what i mean.

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
people expect their pages to be handled like IE handles them, typically

[15:24:01.0000] <maodun>
so is the thought process that, because of IE, people tend to expect things such as &Lambda to pass through?

[15:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't mean that they think "haha! i am going to omit a semicolon and that will trigger odd behavior!"

[15:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
i mean they just write web pages with mistakes, test them in their browser (usually IE, since IE has more market share), and assume all is well if it works

[15:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, what you said

[15:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
see also the topic of the channel :-)

[15:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
web browsers often make very little sense

[15:26:00.0000] <maodun>
hahaha, ok, thank you for explaining, i now understand why it is implemented this way.

[15:26:01.0000] <jmb>
browsers make no sense. you have to be certified insane to work on one

[15:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok can anyone see anything obviously wrong with http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/.ietf-websocket-protocol/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-00 other than the two missing sections?


2009-01-09
[16:03:00.0000] <hober>
404

[16:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-00.txt

[17:33:00.0000] <maodun>
Maybe this isn't a big deal, but unless I can't read html5lib doesn't seem to conform to the spec here: http://rafb.net/p/3AqRUj30.html .  Is this intentional?

[17:34:00.0000] <takkaria>
the spec has probably changed under html5lib in that case

[17:35:00.0000] <maodun>
so the spec is more modern?

[17:35:01.0000] <takkaria>
yeah, either that or there's a bug

[17:35:02.0000] <maodun>
ok, thank you

[17:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't think that had changed... do you have a test case demonstrating the problem?

[17:36:00.0000] <takkaria>
either that, or the code does do what the spec says, anyway

[17:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
How is html5lib differing from the spec there?

[17:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's a bit different because it outputs the previously-consumed characters directly, rather than unconsuming them, but the effect should be identical)

[17:37:01.0000] <maodun>
Philip - ah, you're right, my mistake. Sorry.

[17:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It does that to make sure there's only ever one unconsumed character at a time, for minor efficiency gains)

[17:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok, now that's i've split out the protocol to an rfc, i guess teh next step is splitting the api to a w3c draft

[17:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
s/rfc/id/

[00:02:00.0000] <zcorpan___>
hsivonen: http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fdret.net%2Fnetdret%2Fdocs%2Fwilde-cacm2008-xml-fever.html

[00:02:01.0000] <zcorpan___>
hsivonen: since us-ascii is to be treated as windows-1252, why is reparsing required?

[00:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan___: hmm. maybe us-ascii has been aliased to windows-1252 after I last reimplemented aliases

[00:04:00.0000] <zcorpan___>
hsivonen: btw, doesn't validator.nu support changing encoding on the fly?

[00:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: it doesn't.

[00:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: with natural buffering, it doesn't work

[00:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: and bookkeeping of when you can switch is pointlessly complex

[00:08:03.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ok

[00:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: OTOH, hindering buffering to enable on-the-fly change would suck, too

[00:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
did it support on the fly encoding change before?

[00:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: yes, with natural buffering plus bookkeeping

[00:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: which was pointless, because nearly all the time the bookking indicated that you can no longer switch

[00:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: consider having non-ASCII in <title> and the decode buffer not only containing meta but the title, too

[00:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: makes sense. i was just wondering if i was remembering correctly or not :)

[01:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
did Palm just migrate to WebKit as their app runtime? is the old Palm OS still under it?

[01:13:00.0000] <billyjackass>
hsivonen: yeah, they see to have moved to using WebKit as the Web engine for their new "Palm WebOS", but the old Palm OS is not under it

[01:13:01.0000] <billyjackass>
as far as I can tell

[01:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
is WebOS Linux plus proprietary user land?

[01:14:00.0000] <billyjackass>
hsivonen: seems so

[01:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Wikipedia says Closed source and Linux

[01:14:02.0000] <billyjackass>
but there are not a lot of details

[01:14:03.0000] <billyjackass>
Palm has not developed a Palm operating system of their own for several years

[01:14:04.0000] <billyjackass>
they sold the code to Access several years back

[01:15:00.0000] <billyjackass>
but I don't think that WebOS is based on any of that old code at all

[01:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
how many of all the companies that have their own port of WebKit contribute to the platform-independent core feature-wise?

[01:15:02.0000] <billyjackass>
hsivonen: very few, I think

[01:16:00.0000] <billyjackass>
in the particular of Palm, I don't think they have contribued any code back to the trunk at all yet

[01:16:01.0000] <billyjackass>
but maybe they will not that it's public

[01:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I see

[01:17:01.0000] <billyjackass>
Torch Mobile is an exception

[01:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Did Palm just throw away the BeOS code? did they buy it for the staff?

[01:17:03.0000] <billyjackass>
but that's kind of a special case since George Staikos is also one of the main developers of the Qt port of WebKit

[01:18:00.0000] <billyjackass>
I don't know that they did with the BeOS code. That's part of what Access owns now. Not sure what if anything they did with it

[01:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Does that mean that you are resposible for some of the \ line continuation characters in html5lib?

[01:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me has been stripping those out whenever he encounters them

[01:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
(but I thought anne had put them all in)

[01:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I don't think I've intentionally added any, except when copying existing code that has them

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/ http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-00.txt

[01:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
both are autogenerated from http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/comms.html#network

[01:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
(which i'll eventually remove, once they're stable and so on)

[01:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: OK :) It ould be nice if they disappeared over time :)

[01:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I'm happy to agree with that :-)

[01:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: cool

[01:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: btw, do you know why Adam published the content-type-sniffing draft at his own space instead of at the IETF site?

[01:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
same reason http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/.ietf-websocket-protocol/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-01.prepare exists

[01:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
he's still editing it

[01:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[02:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: How are you creating the RFC format doc in the end?

[02:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: "_This section only applies to user agents, not to servers._" — that goes against RFC rules

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
html-[script]->xml-[xml2rfc]->rfc

[02:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
what goes against RFC rules?

[02:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: underlining

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's not underlining in the sense they mean in the rules

[02:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
they mean literally overstriking an underbar

[02:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's a holdover from the 70s

[02:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is probably just missing something

[02:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't see how you can overstrike (in what he thinks of as overstriking) in a plain US-ASCII file

[02:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's because you're not using a teletype :-)

[02:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
in the olden days, when RFCs were new, computer screens weren't the norm

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
and teletypes would literally print output

[02:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, yeah

[02:16:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Teletypes would allow such things, true

[02:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
so you could underline an X by outputting 0x58 0x08 0x5F

[02:16:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I can see.

[02:16:06.0000] <Hixie>
that's what's not allowed

[02:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
(because 0x08 isn't allowed)

[02:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway :-)

[02:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-editor/instructions2authors.txt also more generally states, though "No overstriking (or underlining) is allowed."

[02:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
right, that's what they mean though

[02:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess we can find out for sure upon RFC Ed. review :)

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how to handle terms like "task source" in http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/

[02:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
link them to WHATWG? list them in an appendix with references to HTML5?

[02:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone has any bright ideas, let me know

[02:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[02:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: they defined in HTML 5?

[02:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
but i must sleep

[03:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Am I the only one who finds it amusing that Shelley Powers complains about multiple venues of discussion in the commenting system of her blog thereby launching yet another venue?

[03:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I suggest we all complain/agree about that on our blogs, and get further discussions going there

[03:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, the notion that the WHATWG list needs to be shut down implies that those who demand it don't trust in the HTML WG list getting enough traction on its own merit

[03:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they do trust in that, and just don't think the administrative cost of having multiple lists (and hence having to subscribe to them all, and deciding which one to post to, and failing to reach people who are only on one list) is justified by the benefits of keeping both lists

[03:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
as it happens, the reasons why the W3C list exists in the first place are the reasons why some people who are on the WHATWG list don't subscribe to the W3C list

1) the patent policy shuts out non-appointed employees of Members and 2) getting input from a wider community gets too much input

[03:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
although #2 has gotten a lot better lately

[03:29:00.0000] <webben_>
hsivonen: Rather amusingly, 1) basically shuts out employees of ex-members too.

[03:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, perhaps the best solution to this is to shut down both lists and just have discussions on blogs

[03:30:01.0000] <webben_>
or Twitter ;)

[03:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
or on a Wiki

[03:30:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
or multiple Wikis

[03:30:04.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. Yahoo! is not on http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List when did that happen?

[03:30:05.0000] <MikeSmith>

I get really weird errors from Jing when trying to integrate MikeSmith's patches

[03:36:03.0000] <hsivonen>
"Loaded balanced string"

[03:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. Jing is loading the datatype sample...

[03:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. the sample datatype was confusing Jing

[03:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: btw, have you yet integrated any of your Jing changes into the upstream code?

[03:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: onto the branch

[03:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: now it's up to James Clark to pick stuff onto the trunk

[03:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[03:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: if the trunk gains all the functionality I need, I'll switch to the trunk

[04:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
this is the right place

[04:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>

[04:04:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
or your own blog, if you prefer

[04:04:04.0000] <beowulf>
sweet :)

[04:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if it's a complaint, though, the preference is definitely that you complain on your own blog or someone else's

[06:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I hope you don't care about non-double-quoted attributes)

[06:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
not really, although the data contains some noise (e.g. i don't care about  89.0,19.0,89.0...)

[06:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"615, 0, 768, 40 " (with tab at the end) parses differently

[06:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"438,110,496,1ß2,496,156,438,159" parses the same

[06:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
"2,20', 87,38'" differently

[06:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
I left that noise in since it was rare enough to be easy to ignore when reading the output, and since I wanted to see how common non-integers were

[06:07:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[06:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so 3 pages break with the html5 algorithm, out of 130k

[06:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess that's acceptable, but otoh those pages work in today's browsers and it's easy to change the algorithm

[06:38:01.0000] <hallvors>
"Japanese composition is based on the full width design of characters, but strictly following the full width based composition sometimes produces an unbalanced appearance. In such exceptional cases, the appearance as a result of the composition must be given higher priority than the full width design principle. When and how to invoke such exceptional procedures has a direct bearing on the quality of the text layout. In other words, it is

[06:38:02.0000] <hallvors>
of how to resolve the conflicts between the principle and the products of it."

[06:39:00.0000] <hallvors>

/me looks at http://realtech.burningbird.net/semantic-web/semantic-markup/oh-look-its-not-just-us-semantic-web-dweebs-who-noticed and wonders why a semanticist uses inline svg for decorative background images

[07:17:00.0000] <annevk>
SVG clutter is hip

[07:19:00.0000] <annevk>
/me is a bit confused by http://alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=7#65

[07:20:00.0000] <annevk>
e.g. "I’d predict the chances of its widespread adoption happening anytime soon is pretty much non-existent. You only have to look to XHTML2 for a very near parallel example."

[07:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: curiously, the bg image doesn't zoom in Firefox. So SVG is not Scalable? :-)

[07:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
XHTML2 totally hasn't crossed The Chasm

[07:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(HTML5 hasn't either)

[07:23:00.0000] <annevk>
But why XHTML2 is a parallel example is beyond me. (Although it seems that the XHTML2 WG does want to make it more in line in some way. E.g. by using the same namespace and by allowing people to use text/html as media type. (Not sure if the XHTML2 WG decided to do that, but various WG members have suggested as much.))

[07:24:00.0000] <webben_>
annevk: I think the parallel is authors won't adopt XHTML2 because it doesn't work in IE; he's saying the new elements mean HTML5 won't work in IE and that therefore authors won't use HTML5 either.

[07:25:00.0000] <webben_>
same with CSS.

[07:27:00.0000] <annevk>
that I can agree with

[07:27:01.0000] <annevk>
although some set of authors have been pushing IE by including scripted workarounds, etc.

[07:27:02.0000] <webben_>
Yep. That set of authors should be fine with HTML5 too.

[07:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what we need is authors using CSS features that IE doesn't support and then we need people to oversee how sites looks in Other Browsers

[07:28:01.0000] <webben_>
oversee?

[07:28:02.0000] <webben_>
you mean over people's shoulders?

[07:28:03.0000] <annevk>
and the theory is that if we use attributes at least the things that do not have much behavior but just layout effects could be made to work in IE?

[07:28:04.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: yes

[07:29:00.0000] <webben_>
annevk: Yes.

[07:29:01.0000] <webben_>
annevk: Well, IE7.

[07:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
webben_: because putting a "best viewed" conditional comment taunt would be annoying

[07:29:03.0000] <Lachy>
I think I'm going to need to write a detailed response to that ALA article to explain why we're introducing new elements and how we came up with the set we did, if I can find the time to do it.

[07:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
and also explain why using attributes like John proposed is a bad idea

[07:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: and perhaps publish in on ALA to generate a twitter storm in the other direction :-)

[07:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
yep

[07:30:03.0000] <webben_>
since div[section] or div[role=section] or whatever will only work in IE7

[07:31:00.0000] <webben_>
I guess you could use <div section class="section"> for IE6 support.

[07:31:01.0000] <webben_>
though that's getting pretty verbose!

[07:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
Does anyone else find it ironic that he complains about the new elements not working in IE6 without a JavaScript based hack, and then proposes an alternative solution using attributes and attribute selectors that also doesn't work in IE6 without a much more complicated JS hack (like Dean Edward's IE7 script)

[07:34:00.0000] <webben_>
Yes.

[07:35:00.0000] <webben_>
I guess it depends on how you assess the importance of IE6 support.

[07:36:00.0000] <webben_>
well, IE6 -JS support.

[07:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
in the comment annevk pointed to he says "My argument is that we simply can’t ignore IE6 and backwards compatibility more generally..."

[07:38:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, which is weird, since it has always been our goal that features are implementable in IE

[07:38:01.0000] <annevk>
though more recently some advanced stuff has been added because the IE Team is back in the game

[07:39:00.0000] <webben_>
anybody know off-hand how IE8 RC1 handles <section> ... can we style it?

[07:40:00.0000] <annevk>
webben_, if you use the createElement hack, yes

[07:40:01.0000] <annevk>
webben_, from what I've heard anyway

[07:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yep

[07:41:01.0000] <webben_>
Anyone chatted to them about fixing that so it works without JS?

[07:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I take it that Windows 7 beta includes a newer IE than IE8b2?

[07:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems that the blog where the download is supposed to get announced has melted

[07:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: yes

[07:42:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i think it includes the beta that, um, "beta testers" got a while back

[07:42:03.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: The link was meant to be on <http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/default.aspx>

[07:42:04.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: My informal understanding is that it is too late in the IE8 release cycle for substantial changes at this stage

[07:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Nothing there has changed

[07:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
webben_, jgraham: Yeah, cwilso was saying as much at TPAC w.r.t other things

[07:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how many people will get trojaned when the download quota of Windows 7 beta is up those who didn't get it seek illicit copies

[07:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: It was meant to be released afternoon PST

[07:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: So it isn't even the right time yet

[07:50:02.0000] <rubys>

[07:50:03.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: "Adoption of continuous innovations (that do not force a significant change of behavior by the customer) are still best described by the original Technology adoption lifecycle"

[07:51:00.0000] <smedero>
gsnedders: they shipped RC1 to a small group of microsoft partners.

[07:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
That is a HTML5 goal

[07:51:02.0000] <smedero>
not through the more public beta group

[07:51:03.0000] <jgraham>
So if we have succeeded we shouldn't ned to cross the chasm

[07:51:04.0000] <gsnedders>

jgraham: true. let's see if authors think it's continuous

[07:52:01.0000] <rubys>
that looks much improved.  Significant omission being the nav bar.

[07:53:00.0000] <rubys>
can't wait to play with it myself to see if the javascript workaround for unknown elements is still required and to see if I can get the navbar back.

[07:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. nice. span is now allowed on both col and colgroup

[07:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: It is

[07:54:00.0000] <rubys>
odd that only the first <hr> is shown, and that the number of comments isn't right aligned.

[07:54:01.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: the workaround is still required

[07:54:02.0000] <rubys>
the workaround didn't work for ie8 beta2

[07:54:03.0000] <zcorpan>
it works now 

[07:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
The workaround worked for parsing, just not for CSS

[07:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: It works now

[07:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
but now it works for CSS too, so that's okay

[08:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
validator.nu goes down for kernel update

[08:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: depending on the user's settings however your page could be as broken as it is in ie7

[08:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh great. the validator.nu process didn't restart properly...

[08:02:01.0000] <rubys>
if my page is valid and you can actually read the text and navigate in IE, I consider that a victory.

[08:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems that my clever deployment automation broke automatic recovery from reboot...

[08:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I had all my content disappear in IE7 adding document.createElement("header"). It's quite funny.

[08:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[08:06:00.0000] <rubys>
/me takes a step backwards and awaits further instruction

[08:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It appears the only way I can get my website to look how I want it without bloating the markup is css3-layout. Yay.

[08:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is bloating the stylesheets any better than bloating the markup?

[08:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
html5.validator.nu goes down for kernel update

[08:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It means I'm not bloating semantic markup with stuff purely for presentational purposes

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Why is that good?

[08:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Who is consuming the semantics of your web page

[08:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Nobody :P

[08:17:03.0000] <Philip`>
So you're just wasting your time? :-)

[08:17:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it presentation of structure and bloat

[08:17:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Of course :)

[08:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
html5.validator.nu is taking distressingly long to boot...

[08:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I can't work out what that sentence means

[08:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oops

[08:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: s/presentation/separation/

[08:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so many buzzwords

[08:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

gsnedders: pragmatically CSS is harder to understand than HTML so you are better off having complexity in the HTML than in the CSS</devils advocate>

[08:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: See the thing I posted in the gap

[08:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: But CSS is cooler than HTML.

[08:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
Wow, you have a screwed up definition of cool

[08:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[08:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
masochism ftw! :P

[08:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(therefore, CSS ftw! :P)

[08:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. looks like html5.validator.nu isn't coming back up

[08:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
still trying some things before changing the DNS to plan B, because reversing that solution will take time

[08:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
actually, I guess I'd better do that immediately anyway

[08:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. DNS for html5.validator.nu is being updated to point to the other server

[08:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it could be that Gandi is relocating Xen images upon reboot and doing it *really* slowly this time

[08:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/presto211/canvas/index.dml - "<canvas width="150" height="200"> <canvas> element not supported.</canvas>"

[08:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's not going to work so well

[08:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I can't figure anything more that I could do to bring html5.validator.nu faster than it takes to update DNS :-(

[08:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
sorry about the inconvenience

[08:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whee! html5.validator.nu is back up

[08:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if the UI is still trying to stop it...

[09:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. great. now Gandi stopped the VM

[09:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. they estimate a boot time of 9 minutes!

[09:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>

[09:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Use relative positioning instead?

[09:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
My whole design relies upon it being absolute.

[09:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hacks away at it some more to remove the need

[09:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
37 minutes to boot the Xen VM at Gandi

[09:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
previously 1 minute...

[09:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, html5.validator.nu is now back

[10:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Heh. Now I'm getting ignored. Fun.

[10:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is just about holding back from just trolling now

[10:46:01.0000] <jcranmer>
but Mr. Schmid's proposals are just... o_O

"Don't use rem, use em of root"

[10:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
no, "em of :root"

[10:47:02.0000] <jcranmer>
because we all know that's wonderful to write a CSS parser for..

[10:47:03.0000] <jcranmer>
oh right, it's a selector

[10:48:00.0000] <jcranmer>
ambiguous parses FTW!

[10:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Obviously.

[10:51:00.0000] <jcranmer>
font: 5 em of .water p

[10:52:00.0000] <jcranmer>
is it 5 "em of .water p" or 5 "em of .water" with a font-family of p?

Hixie: the Atom working group was created without either myself (or, I think, Tim Bray) ever attending a meeting or paying a dime.

/me thinks rubys can read logs faster than he does.

[17:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
accessibility also fits this description: "Where technologies really struggle is with their adoption by mainstream users [..]" (Re: http://alistapart.com/comments/semanticsinhtml5?page=7#65)

[17:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"[...] an enormous amount of energy and resources and have still not addressed significant shortcomings in HTML." The data table headers stuff has probably cost humanity a 5-figure amount in US dollars but has addressed several shortcomings in the HTML5 of 2007.

[17:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(on class, id and rel) "[...] any semantics we layer on top of these attributes is really by tenuous convention." That is exactly the goal of distributed extensibility, isn't it? You make stuff up without spending n years going through a standards track?

[17:43:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(Shelley Powers on supporting IE6) "But what you’re saying is most designers won’t even take the chance. Wow, must be safe to be them." It's been a non-negotiable contractual obligation in every web project I've worked on since 2005.

[05:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Looks like Microsoft is behaving as if BitTorrent hadn't been invented when it comes to distributing Windows 7 beta.

[05:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they're behaving as if a large number of people don't have a BitTorrent client and don't want to have to find and install and learn how to use one, and they don't want to unfairly make the beta available only to the people who already understand BitTorrent

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
If downloading Windows 7 beta were a killer application of BitTorrent, people would install a BitTorrent client.

[05:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
One would think that the kind of people who'd install an OS beta would be able to deal with BitTorrent.

[05:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
Then those people will realise a week from now that they've been uploading at full speed for the past week and their ISP throttles them, and they blame Microsoft

[05:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
People who would install an OS beta and already know about BitTorrent would just go to http://thepiratebay.org/search/windows%207/0/7/0

[05:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in that case MS should at least publicize a cryptographic hash for a legitimate iso image

[05:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
btw, is the EULA of the beta reasonable--particularly for people who might work on something that competes with an MS product?

[05:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: The issue seems to be giving out product keys — not the downloading.

[05:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: The ISOs are still available, and always came down at a sane speed

[05:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/aa497440.aspx quotes http://twitter.com/Ekus/statuses/1108872611 which is the same MD5 as the torrent, so at least the checksum is (temporarily) mentioned on a Microsoft web site :-)

[05:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
(That twit also suggests that the ISOs aren't always available at a sane speed)

[05:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It never got below 100KB/s even when everything else had completely stopped.

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: where on an MS site are the isos still available?

[05:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
100KB/s sounds incredibly slow :-p

[05:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: They aren't linked anywhere :P

[05:22:03.0000] <gsnedders>

/me decides that the only reason he'd want to test the latest version of Windows is to check application compatibility of stuff he's writing, and there's no point doing that now so he might as well wait a year until it's closer to release

[05:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm mainly interested in testing IE8 behavior on a non-XP system

[05:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but then I have no idea if it is worthwhile

[05:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps the XP version behaves identically

[05:27:03.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: was it fine in parallels in the end?

[05:28:00.0000] <webben>
/me would like to see it running in a parallels or vmware cage ;)

[05:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It apparently runs fine in VMWare

[05:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: I haven't had a chance to try yet

[05:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't have enough RAM to run it in VMWare without quitting everything else :P

[05:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: but today's Parallels update lists Windows 7 compat as a new feature

[05:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I imagine it might differ in cases where it relies on the OS's Unicode support, and things like that

[05:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs more RAM

[05:29:03.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: how much RAM do you have?

[05:29:04.0000] <gsnedders>
2GB

[05:29:05.0000] <Philip`>
(but it probably ought to be the same on Win7 as on Vista)

[05:29:06.0000] <gsnedders>
I also tend to have a lot of things open at once.

[05:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me currently has 40MB free RAM

[05:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
"free" is a bit meaningless if it doesn't include e.g. disk buffers

[05:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
and the amount used by applications is a bit meaningless anyway, because maybe half of it could easily be swapped out to disk and you wouldn't even notice

[05:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I suppose all you can really do is try running VMware and see how slow everything it goes, and if it's slow then buy more RAM, and if it's not then buy more RAM anyway because RAM is cheap :-)

[05:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The problem is OS X grinds to a halt when it starts swapping all too often :(

[05:32:02.0000] <gsnedders>
And RAM for the MBP really has got cheap now. £35.64 for 4GB.

[05:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me remembers the good old days when people said "wow, RAM is really cheap now at £1/GB!"

[05:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[05:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[05:33:03.0000] <Philip`>

[05:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>

"<i><b>Mel’s Website</b></i></title>  OR  <title><i><strong>Mel’s Website</strong></i>"

[06:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"1 mark for correct use of <i> tag"

[06:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
"1 mark for correct use of <b> or <strong> tag"

[06:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
"1 mark for correct nesting of tags ie <i><b>   </b></i>"

[06:47:03.0000] <gsnedders>
"Note: nesting might be different but valid ie <b><i>Mel’s Website</i></b>"

[06:47:04.0000] <gsnedders>
"Ignore any “outer” tags eg <title>,<head>,<h1> etc"

[06:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Google seems to have forgotten the "looks like a g even if you don't know it's supposed to be one" requirement for the favicon :)

"Object oriented data storage is more efficient than bitmap storage." - huh?

[06:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
Seems a strange mix of terminology

[06:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: that's really sad. do the students have any recourse to contest the bogus test

[06:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: nope

[06:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: clearly, whoever came up with the test wasn't qualified to be a "Qualificaions Authority"

[06:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I think technically I could file a compliant, but it's hardly likely to make any diference

[06:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(needless to say, I still got an A, which is somewhat amazing with that marking scheme)

[06:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: some reason in there, then

[06:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(There again, getting 28.5% (out of a possible 30% of the overall grade) in the coursework probably helped)

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me buys a DVD which, instead of having one of those annoying anti-piracy adverts that tries hard to make you feel guilty even though you've just paid for the movie, has a leaflet saying "Nice One! Thanks for buying this genuine DVD. We hope you enjoy it. Obviously you're not a Knock-Off Nigel, but rather the kind of person who generally does the right thing."

[07:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: "2009-00-07" is not a date, yet is used in the annotations

[07:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: The torrent includes a scan of that leaflet

[10:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
Just watched the Colbert interview with Lessig. http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/01/larry-lessig-colbert-report - I can't believe Colbert is such an idiot

[10:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
He's not, he just plays one on TV

[10:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
although I don't think Lessig managed to get his message across very well in the interview either, I blame Colbert for having no clue what he was talking about and not letting Lessig actually explain it clearly

[10:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wants a :first-word selector

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
What's a word?

[10:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shrugs

[10:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes CSS 2.1 has word-spacing

[10:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
What problem would :first-word solve, that <span class="first-word"> couldn't?

[10:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
No span! :P

[10:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
What practical problem would :first-word solve, that <span class="first-word"> couldn't?

[10:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
None

[10:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[11:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Doesn't first-word already exist?

[11:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Ah, only first-letter and first-line

[12:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone know anything about a11y of right-aligned ltr text?

[13:02:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Dashiva, it's also in the wrong case (the Google logo uses big G)

[13:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: See the final thing said before you joined

[13:03:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, in a sec

[13:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the Lucian E. Marin one looks excellent, to me: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7ZYqYi4xigk/SWfBJtH93_I/AAAAAAAACOk/TSM_XMc3eoI/s1600-h/Favicon_Lucian.png

[13:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: The Google logo uses a little g too

[13:06:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, but not the initial G, afaict.

[13:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes Philip` never said that the first letter wasn't uppercase

[13:08:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, depends how much you're aligning and how important it is.

[13:08:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, when attributing a big quote to a source, right-aligning the source is fine

[13:09:00.0000] <BenMillard>
but right-aligning your main content would be terrible as it is incompatible with F-shaped reading pattern

[13:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Take a look at <http://secret.gsnedders.com/g6/home.html> in a browser with good css3-selectors support

[13:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why Google still has fairly prominent links to http://www.google.com/intl/en/customlogos.html which is clearly ancient because the logos are incredibly ugly

[13:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: (i..e, a recent WebKit browser, or Opera 9.5+)

[13:10:01.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, using Opera 9.63 I see main content right-aligned, which is bad for sighted users.

[13:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: (where recent means the same as Saf3.2)

[13:10:03.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: My doubt was how much content is too much :)

[13:10:04.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, I'd say more than 1 line across the page is too much, as a general rule

[13:11:00.0000] <BenMillard>
because it's the ragged left position of wrapped lines which makes it hard to scan

[13:11:01.0000] <BenMillard>
it's especially fiddly for screen magnifier users, since they might be at 10x zoom or even more

[13:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
possibly makes life harder for certain forms of dyslexia where gaps and patterns in the text cause severe distraction

[13:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
That font has no antialiasing :-(

[13:12:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Any design suggestions for that which preserve the symmetry without making it annoying to read?

[13:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Swap the left and right sides, since the current right only has very short paragraphs?

[13:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, unless you mirror the text on one side it's not symmetrical anyway. :) I'd say left-align both sides of content so people can read what you wrote.

[13:14:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I guess right-aligning poems is OK, since the lines are short and curious arrangement can be used for artistic expression

[13:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: Then the line line looks silly

[13:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: And justified text is equally problematic

[13:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
BenMillard: What about the alignment of crazy modern poetry like http://pastebin.ca/1305375?

[13:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
gsnedders, artistic license.

[13:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[13:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Then you have problems with needed fixed-width fonts, before worrying about alignment

[13:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/needed/needing/

[13:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me could also hide away all the introspection stuff and simplify everything

[13:19:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, in my experience old mobiles have no fixed-width fonts, but that's all.

[13:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Or you could interleave everything, rather than putting them in separate columns

[13:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is trying to kill off all this introspection :P

[13:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
and maybe use some colour or offset or font or something to distinguish them

[13:20:03.0000] <BenMillard>
like footsteps down the page, perhaps

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why it is so hard for people to explain what rdfa is good for without actually describing rdf

[18:39:00.0000] <jcranmer>
what's the difference?

[18:44:00.0000] <dglazkov>
one is a format, the other one is a concept

[19:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
jcranmer: i don't understand why it is so hard for people to explain what rdfa is good for without actually describing rdfa either

[19:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
jcranmer: that is, people keep describing the solution they want, without saying what the problem they want to solve is

[19:12:01.0000] <jcranmer>
here's the problem RDFa solves:

[19:12:02.0000] <jcranmer>
there's obviously not enough RDF in the world!

[03:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
"Every element in the text/html serialization has unique treatment. They can often be grouped in to like elements [...]"

[03:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
I don't think that word ("unique") means what he thinks it means...

[03:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, who is that quote from?

[04:16:00.0000] <takkaria>
RB, I believe

[04:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://girtby.net/archives/2009/01/11/they-dont-call-it-hardware-for-nothing/ is probably the first web page I've ever seen where I'd expect <aside> to be a useful element

[04:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
although by "useful element" I just mean "different way of spelling <div class='aside'>"

[05:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Has anyone made a tool that automatically translates IPA pronunciations into a human-readable form?

[07:59:00.0000] <webben>
Philip`: I wonder if any of these notations are human-friendly: http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/gradint/lexconvert.html

[10:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
dotted borders with radius suck in both Gecko and WebKit but in different ways :-(

[10:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. Windows 7 beta doesn't ship with software necessary for viewing YouTube.

[10:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Just like Linux distros.

[10:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess it leaves OS X as the only desktop OS that works with YouTube out-of-the-box

[10:37:03.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Does it have silverlight?

[10:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: looks like it doesn't

[10:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: or at least silverlight.net viewed in IE8 asks me to install Silverlight to better experience the site

[11:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Recommendations for Windows email clients?

[11:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, Thunderbird or Opera

[11:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: SSH and Pine

[11:40:00.0000] <jcranmer>
as a totally unbiased observer

[11:40:01.0000] <jcranmer>
Thunderbird

[11:40:02.0000] <jcranmer>
:-)

[11:40:03.0000] <Dashiva>
They all suck

[11:40:04.0000] <jcranmer>
(I develop on Mozilla's mailnews codebase)

[11:40:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Every client on every OS!

[11:40:06.0000] <webben>
Thunderbird and Mail are almost bearable.

[11:41:00.0000] <webben>
/me hasn't tried Pine or whatever that new Pine variant's called, though.

[11:41:01.0000] <jcranmer>
webben: apline?

[11:41:02.0000] <jcranmer>
er, apline?

[11:41:03.0000] <webben>
that's the one

[11:41:04.0000] <Philip`>
Alpine? :-p

[11:41:05.0000] <jcranmer>
dammit

[11:41:06.0000] <jcranmer>
why do I keep misspelling it?

[11:41:07.0000] <webben>
http://www.washington.edu/alpine/

[11:41:08.0000] <Dashiva>
You're using to typing application!

[11:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has never used any text-mode mail client, and just sticks with Thunderbird since it's easy enough to use and has a button for "reply" which is about the only one he ever needs

[11:42:01.0000] <jcranmer>
don't forget the N key!

[11:43:00.0000] <jcranmer>
occasionally I have to mark as junk, but server-side spam filters are doing good right now

[11:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jcranmer: How about making the "not junk" button put stuff back where it was? :)

[11:44:01.0000] <jcranmer>
hey, I don't do UI

[11:44:02.0000] <jcranmer>
right now I'm mired in code so deep that trying to get the UI would require walking back through fifteen classes

[11:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm sure the UI has a pretty straight path into the core for that functionality

[11:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: I have no idea what the N key does, and I don't want to press it in case it's "nuke mail database" or something like that

[11:45:02.0000] <jcranmer>
no, it's "Next message"

[11:45:03.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[11:45:04.0000] <jcranmer>
/me kills the person who made the G action nonreversible

[11:45:05.0000] <Philip`>
I just use the space bar mostly

[11:45:06.0000] <Dashiva>
jcranmer: Is your kill nonreversible too?

[11:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
jcranmer, what's the G action?

[11:46:01.0000] <jcranmer>
Group By sort

[11:46:02.0000] <jcranmer>
Dashiva: you have to hit up and then K again, generally

[11:46:03.0000] <jcranmer>
assuming you didn't switch to a different folder/newsgroup

[11:47:00.0000] <jcranmer>
/me also uses K heavily thanks to some spam-infested newsgroups

[11:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, that's quite useful. I need to use that more often

[11:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
(I'm referring to 'G')

[11:48:02.0000] <Lachy>
is K delete?

[11:48:03.0000] <jcranmer>
kill thread

[11:48:04.0000] <jcranmer>
delete is <Del>, of course

[11:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me tries that on some threads in my junk folder

[11:49:01.0000] <jcranmer>
it only works in newsgroups, unfortunately

[11:49:02.0000] <jcranmer>
the K key

[11:49:03.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[11:49:04.0000] <Lachy>
that's why it did nothing

[11:50:00.0000] <jcranmer>
kill thread actually just ignores it so it doesn't generally appear in UI

[11:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Wow. U. of Washingon itself fixed the license finally

[11:50:02.0000] <jcranmer>
there's no way to delete newsgroup messages from the local db since <Del> is remapped to Cancel instead of Delete ...

[11:50:03.0000] <jcranmer>
(as well as other UI for `Delete')

[11:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it just me, or does Opera render any text typed into the search box on http://www.notebookreview.com/ entirely invisibly?

[11:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://www.isitjustmeordoesoperarenderanytexttypedintothesearchboxinvisible.com/notebookreview.com/

[11:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
No, it seems the box doesn't take focus at all

[11:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, file a bug about that

[11:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
I can type into the box and press enter to search for what I typed

[11:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
I just can't see anything in the box

[11:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I'm too lazy to do that today, so it'll have to wait until later

[11:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I'll file a bug tomorrow morning

[11:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
I could do it now, but I'm too tired

[11:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Thanks, I was hoping you'd say something like that ;-)

[11:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
that party I went to last night was fun, but exhausting. I've done almost nothing but sleep today

[12:43:00.0000] <csarven>
If <aside> is to say "sidebar", then would <section> be to distinct components in that sidebar? e.g., <aside><section>Related content ..</section> <section>Tagcloud ..</section></aside>

[12:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
csarven, you could do that if you wanted

[12:44:00.0000] <csarven>
Thanks.

[12:45:00.0000] <csarven>
I'm actually using class="aside" and class="section" *for now* but still wanted to keep the same meaning and pattern.

[12:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm playing with the Windows 7 public beta. I've noticed te task bar is becoming a lot closer in functionality to the OS X Dock

[12:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
and, AFAICT, they've dropped the Glass theme from Vista entirely

[12:55:00.0000] <sid0>
er, no, they haven't

[12:55:01.0000] <sid0>
you probably need a graphics driver update

[12:55:02.0000] <Lachy>
then I wonder why I can't see it then. I'm running the 64 bit edition in VMWare

[12:56:00.0000] <sid0>
"in VMWare" -- that's the reason

[12:56:01.0000] <sid0>
vmware isn't hardware accelerated

[12:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[12:56:03.0000] <sid0>
and the new taskbar has a lot of niceties in glass mode that aren't there with the dock

[12:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Maybe I'll have to install it onto a spare partition on my old PC or setup BootCamp on my iMac

[13:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the system tray icons in Windows 7 have regressed to 1980s

[13:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, LOL

[13:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, they are pretty bad

oh, didn't realize the HTTPOnly guys are planning to fix the mess that is cookies

[16:45:01.0000] <annevk>
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/http-state/current/msg00000.html

[16:46:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess that's good news, although I hope they won't make them much more complicated along the way...

[00:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
The releases of IE8 (compat view button) and Firefox 3.1 (<video>) are near... I wonder if I should start promoting the HTML5 doctype on my doctype page even though the HTML5 parsing algorithm hasn't shipped in a browser release...

[01:18:00.0000] <zcorpan___>
Hixie: could you apply the toc script to the multipage version too? also it would look better with .toc input { vertical-align: middle; }

[01:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
although a fully expanded toc is useful for searching

[01:22:01.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe you should have an expand all button?

[01:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It should be displayed fully expanded when printing

[01:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(or a checkbox "use collapsable toc" which can remember the setting with a cookie)

[01:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or don't collapse the TOC at all, but add a separate table above it that just lists the major section headings and then links to the relevant parts of the TOC

[01:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[01:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, running the toc script onload causes an annoying delay because the spec is so large. If you add the script just after the TOC and let it execute immediately, the delay would be less noticable

[01:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oops. I seem to have acidentially joined the distributed extensibility discussion

[03:14:00.0000] <annevk>
with a bit more publicitiy someone could make a fulltime job out of following HTML5 tweets on twitter

them

[03:15:02.0000] <annevk>
we have lastweekinthetag now?

[03:15:03.0000] <annevk>
that'd be an awesome blog

[03:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps someone should make one

[03:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
there are interesting bits like: "<jar> When I mentioned this metadata discovery issue to a library scientist, they said: Why on earth would anyone ask the publisher? They're not qualified to provide this kind of information."

[03:18:00.0000] <annevk>
that's sort of a blow for RDFa

[03:18:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe we should have the blog on IRC instead :)

[03:20:00.0000] <svl>
Think Mr. Last Week would be so kind as to then do all the hard work of pushing it out in blog format?

[03:20:01.0000] <annevk>
one can hope

[03:21:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm http://orderedlist.com/articles/structural-tags-in-html5 is a lot more markup than I typically need for my blog homepage

/me agrees as well

[03:22:04.0000] <annevk>
it was thought to be too late to change

[03:23:00.0000] <annevk>
semantics are more like share-with-origin than access-control-allow-origin

[03:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Cross-Origin Data Sharing?

[03:24:00.0000] <annevk>
well, we can change the spec title, we can change the spec shortname, but we can't change the header names anymore I think

[03:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I agree that changing headers at this point would be harmful.

[03:29:00.0000] <annevk>
I suppose we could rename it, dunno

[03:29:01.0000] <annevk>
though s/Data/Resource prolly as it's also for font files, images, etc.

[03:30:00.0000] <annevk>
not sure if it's worth the trouble

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has never found the name confusing, since he just treats it as an opaque identifier

[03:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip` is unusual

[03:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me takes that as a compliment

[03:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: That blog post goes a bit overboard on the use of <header> and <section> but basically looks OK. More to the point every single comment is positive which is encouraging. 

[03:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
It would be useful to know where the people writing these articles get their information from

[03:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. do they read the actual spec?

[03:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
and do they follow the mailing lists?

[03:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
or are they mostly echoing other already-summarised documents?

[03:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Waiting for official support for HTML5 structural tags from search engines… any news from this field?" - we need to spread rumours that Google favours sites using HTML5 markup, and then all the SEO experts will rush to adopt it

[03:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: will they replace <body> with <body><article> and </body> with </article></body>?

[03:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder if someone's going to comment about firefox 2

[03:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: No, Google has an advanced secret algorithm developed by teams of PhDs and augmented by billions of pages of training information, that will detect when you're using HTML5 elements stupidly and will penalise you for it

[03:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
according to my anonymous insider source

[03:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
You may not believe me given the total lack of evidence, but surely you can't take the risk of losing your number one search results to your competitors by ignoring me

[03:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm. If people are going to implement live preview on their comment forms it would be nice if it corresponded to what actually got posted.

[03:59:01.0000] <zcorpan>
it seems the createElement hack doesn't work as expressions (and ie8 seems to ignore 'behavior' in ie8 mode)

[04:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
It would also be nice if they documented whatever magic syntax it is they are using for formatting

[04:00:01.0000] <annevk>
I thought expressions were a killed feature in super standards mode

[04:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway I replied to the article :)

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk>
how is http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile12/ a REC? didn't it depend on DOM Level 3 Events?

[04:14:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess it doesn't

[04:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Are you attempting to apply logic to the status of the spec?

[04:16:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, yes

[04:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
No good will ever come of such foolishness

[04:18:00.0000] <annevk>
did you just call me a fool?

[04:18:01.0000] <annevk>
:p

[04:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
Certainly, coming in here and attempting to use logic!

[04:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, FYI, I just filed the bug about the textbox on notebookreview.com that you mentioned yesterday

[04:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Okay, thanks

[04:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: the way the toc is set up in http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile12/ seems more useful than html5

[04:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that there was a suggestion many months ago for each multipage page to include the subset of the TOC corresponding to that page

[04:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it seems like it could be a good idea

[04:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
(but non-trivial to implement)

[04:25:00.0000] <annevk>
why non-trivial? can't you just keep a copy of the toc around and copy the relevant part in?

[04:26:00.0000] <annevk>
i do think it's sort of useful to have the complete toc as well, maybe list both on the first page?

[04:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
What is "the relevant part"?

[04:26:02.0000] <annevk>
the part that matches first heading of the page to the last heading of the page

[04:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
particularly when the page starts at a subsubsection, so it needs to work out to indent the first TOC entry by the right number of levels

[04:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
It would probably still be a reasonable thing to do; it just needs a little bit of thought, which is why I haven't done it yet :-)

[04:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
((I guess the only non-triviality is that it can't just extract a subtree (or consecutive sequence of subtrees) from the TOC's DOM, since it's not always split along tree lines))

[04:34:00.0000] <takkaria>
I find it very useful as it is now

[04:34:01.0000] <takkaria>
I know that if I want to find a treebuilder step, I can hit cmd-F and type "insertion mode"

[04:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Has anyone written a mail client that detects if your message contains a string "(have|is|see) attached" and warns you if you're sending it without an attachment?

[04:36:00.0000] <gavin>
there's http://nic-nac-project.de/~kaosmos/index-en.html#ar

[04:36:01.0000] <takkaria>
Philip`: there's a thunderbird extension which does it, I 'm pretty ure

[04:37:00.0000] <gavin>
(which is a thunderbird extension that does it)

[04:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, neat :-)

[04:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://orderedlist.com/articles/getting-started-with-html5 - oh, sounds like it's the start of a series

[04:46:00.0000] <annevk>
it is

[04:46:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wonders where jgraham's comment went

[04:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: It's on the next one in the series http://orderedlist.com/articles/structural-tags-in-html5

[04:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, please remove the TOC script. I can't find anything now!

[04:49:00.0000] <hallvors>
(Pegasus mail has had the "notify about missing attachment" feature for ages)

[04:49:01.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: ah

[04:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm. the TOC script seems to make the spec take ages to load in Firefox too which I guess is only fair since it already takes ages to load in Opera

[04:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Takes about a second to toggle the TOC sections in Firefox too

[04:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh it seems to ork OK in epiphany-webkit

[04:55:00.0000] <annevk>
TOC script?

[04:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Load the WHATWG spec

[04:56:01.0000] <annevk>
/me tries

[04:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
The non-multipage one in particular

[04:57:01.0000] <annevk>
christ

[04:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me notices that orderedlist.com uses <cite> around comment authors' names

[05:07:00.0000] <hdh>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/status-documentation.html is sent as text/plain

[05:07:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, ^^

[05:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notes that the slider at http://orderedlist.com/contact/ has differently sized steps (1,2,3,4,5,7.5,10,20,30,40,50)

[05:11:00.0000] <annevk>
i guess we could let step="" accept some kind of function at some point?

[05:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
how would that work?

[05:12:01.0000] <annevk>
though I'm not sure why budget should follow such a function

[05:13:00.0000] <annevk>
step="1.5x" or something? dunno

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Sounds like that probably falls outside the 80%

[05:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
and anyway you can just have your script / server interpret the linear slider output as the input to a non-linear function that gives the real value

[06:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me adds toc.js to his AdBlocker. Problem solved :-)

[06:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me added *.com.com to his block list maybe a year ago, but recently discovered that some legitimate sites use com.com to host all their static images and CSS

[06:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: the slider under discussion is linear but with some steps removed

[06:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[06:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me didn't notice since the slider doesn't work for him in Opera

[06:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.antplc.com/ant_galio_browser.asp?menu=153 - "Remote Event Support (HTML 5)"

[06:52:00.0000] <wakaba>
Hixie: i didn't read irc last week, sorry

[06:54:00.0000] <wakaba>
re missing module, it is included in cvs version of tarball

[06:54:01.0000] <wakaba>
i added link to that tarball in the webpage.  thank you!

[06:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.palm.com/assets/js/dist/mojo.js is interesting

[06:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm wondering what other *.js filenames we could fish for there

[07:01:00.0000] <takkaria>
Apple make use of non-linear sliders in a few places in OS X

[07:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so it seems some admin dumbass at Wikipedia is poised to delete the entry for JohnResig because he's an "NN person"

[07:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://twitter.com/jeresig/status/1113245384

[07:27:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
wtf does "Prodding after speedy per request"

[07:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
The article is missing references that would support his notability. Merely being the creator of JQuery isn't enough and based on the content of the article, it's not really surprising it was up for deletion

[07:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
surely there must be some news articles from reputable sources that talk about JQuery and mention JohnResig that could be cited.

[07:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
jesus

[07:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
with all the other crap that makes up the bulk of Wikipedia, I'd think they'd find lots of other things to spend their time on

[07:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://twitter.com/diveintomark/statuses/917843268

[07:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[07:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
Once you realise that wikipedia makes far more sense

[07:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Mark is spot-on as usual

[07:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
If some people didn't spend time marking single-line bios for deletion, what would stop people adding a billion pages about everyone on the planet and resulting in a huge burden to anyone who does anything that's O(n) in the size of the wiki?

[07:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm still waiting for someone to write a wikipedia article about me

[07:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: I'll write one about you

[07:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, if you think I'm notable enough, and have sources to back it up, go for it

[07:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'll nominate you for deletion

[07:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
thanks Philip` 

[07:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
No problem

[07:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't care about notable or sources... I'll just make it all up, along with the citations

[07:41:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I've done it before

[07:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's the great thing about Wikipedia

[07:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Cross-post it to Uncyclopedia

[07:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I guess you could list the specs I've edited, my interview on WSG or something

[07:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll be happy if it makes it on deletionpedia

[07:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith totally needs a wikipedia page as Mike_TM_Smith

[07:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
Alas, it looks like my page was already deleted

[07:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
("Philip Taylor, is the great-great-great-great grandson of U.S. President Taylor, and is a junior from Calvary Chapel Christian School in...")

[07:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me gets highly confused, because the online weather monitoring system for his building says there is 0 mm/hr of rain, but his window says there is much more

[07:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
The internet makes life far too hard

[07:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm working on the Lachy article; so far, I've got the parts about his illegitimate love child, his secret meth lab, panty thievery... wondering what else I need to add

[07:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: maybe it only gets updated hourly

[07:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or fortnightly

[07:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh wait, I had confused the article I was writing about Lachy with the one I wrote about myself

[07:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me ponders the use of "free" in "Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia"

[07:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think "free" in software/online contexts has pretty much come to mean, "Anything that attracts a lot of guys who are very much like the Comic Book Store Guy in the Simpsons"

[07:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: The graph seems to get updated at least every ten minutes, and the textual version at least every minute, so it's not such an easy explanation :-(

[07:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: maybe it's just very finicky and expects only a certain quality of rain, regardless of quantity

[07:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Perhaps it was calibrated to work with unicorn tears, not bog standard rain

[07:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me assumes that the rain monitoring system was merely designed by the same people who designed the climate control system at the CMS and therefore has opposite notions of "hot", "cold", "wet" and "dry" to those employed by mortal humans

[08:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: It's Comic Book Guy, not Comic Book Store Guy.

[08:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: thanks, you've proven you have the qualities to participate in "free"

[08:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[08:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me types on his laptop running a "non-free" OS/

[08:02:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: easy way to test that: just get a unicorn and have it watch "Bambi" or "Old Yeller"

[08:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
One of the options for second-year CS group projects here was to develop a climate control system for the CS building (particularly the room in which all the projects were going to be demonstrated), but they found it difficult because the real building admin people wouldn't let them open any doors or windows because it would disturb the rest of the building

[08:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
My main issues with Win7 so far: No decent POSIX shell, and no virtual desktops.

[08:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: I find it much quicker to squeeze certain parts of the unicorn's anatomy until it cries

[08:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(in that order of from most to least important)

[08:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: I like the way you think

[08:04:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: Cygwin is "free"

[08:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: Cygwin's shell sucks though.

[08:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's bash

[08:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
It's in a window that's really hard to resize

[08:05:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
rxvt

[08:05:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Half of that suckiness is the fact it is workaround the fact that the FS isn't POSIX compliant to start with

[08:05:05.0000] <rubys>
opera (the site) is down?

[08:05:06.0000] <gsnedders>
And the other half is that half the folders aren't called what I expect

[08:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Also, ~ isn't my normal user folder

[08:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Also, I can't drag a folder/file into the shell to get the pathname copied there like I can on Terminal.app

[08:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
rubys: seems so.. I can't get to it at least

[08:06:03.0000] <rubys>
/me likes cygwin, makes windows tolerable

[08:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: If you don't like unexpected folder names, it seems your complaint is really "it's not OS X" rather than "it's not POSIX-compliant"

[08:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I mean things like "My Documents" come up as "Documents"

[08:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me prefers to avoid windows rather than endure cygwin

[08:08:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finds shells on OS X, Solaris, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, etc. far more bearable than Cygwin

[08:08:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: I think you can fix that by pouring some water into the vents

[08:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Vista (and presumably Win7) doesn't have "My Documents", it just has "Documents"

[08:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
so that's nothing to do with the shell

[08:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It appears in the GUI as My Documents

[08:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm

[08:09:04.0000] <rubys>
cygwin's shell is simply bash, so what people are reacting to is the terminal client?  Or am I missing something?

[08:09:05.0000] <Philip`>
Did they change it from Vista, then?

[08:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: Yeah, it's the terminal client

[08:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Or am I misremembering whether they renamed it on Vista?)

[08:10:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
so use rxvt or whatever

[08:10:03.0000] <rubys>
that's easy, use putty

[08:10:04.0000] <sid0>
it is ~/Documents on both Vista and Win7

[08:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: please first try my pouring-water-into-the-vents solution and let me know if that fixes things

[08:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: Can that work locally without having a whole virtualized OS?

[08:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me starts up Win7 box

[08:11:03.0000] <rubys>
it is documents on win7

[08:11:04.0000] <Philip`>
sid0: Is it "Documents" in the GUI in both too?

[08:12:00.0000] <rubys>
gsnedders: yes

[08:12:01.0000] <sid0>
Philip`: yes

[08:12:02.0000] <sid0>
I see there's a junction from "My Documents" to "Documents" for compat

[08:12:03.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Were you complaining about the shell in Win7, or am I getting entirely confused?

[08:13:01.0000] <rubys>
create a shortcut to <path>/putty.exe -cygterm -

[08:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I only have My Documents, no "Documents"

[08:13:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I have "Documents" as a library, but not as a folder

[08:13:04.0000] <rubys>
http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/02/13/Making-Myself-at-Home-temporarily-on-XP#c1202931750

[08:14:00.0000] <sid0>
gsnedders: oh, sorry, I moved my documents folder elsewhere

[08:14:01.0000] <sid0>
though it really doesn't matter how it appears in the gui, does it, in the shell it's still Documents

[08:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It's confusing it isn't consistent

[08:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: thx

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It'd be more confusing if the file path depended on the user's currently-selected language, and it'd also be more confusing if the GUI displayed "[My] Documents" regardless of the user's currently-selected language

[08:17:00.0000] <sid0>
yes, I believe that's the reason

[08:17:01.0000] <sid0>
/me is liking the libraries though

[08:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Libraries?

[08:19:00.0000] <sid0>
er, those virtual views of multiple collated folders

[08:19:01.0000] <sid0>
even over the network

[08:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[08:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't care for them

[08:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Argh, I keep forgetting FF2 doesn't have contenteditable

[08:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what's the easiest way to hack in equivalent functionality for rubbish browsers

[08:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: -cygterm - just causes "unknown option". Meh.

[08:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me supposes he should just use <input>, since he doesn't care about formatting or anything

[08:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://code.google.com/p/puttycyg/ is needed, obviously

[08:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, the weather graph says it rained

[08:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like it averages over ~15 minutes, which introduces some lag

[08:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
let's try deploying all the recent Validator.nu check-ins finally.

MikeSmith: your patches should now be live on validator.nu and html5.validator.nu. Thanks!

[09:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
What's the condition for not using anti-aliasing for text in IE8 on Windows 7? do some older MS-supplied fonts include bitmap glyphs and if you hit one of those sizes exactly, the legacy bitmaps are used

[09:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it sure is ugly

[09:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[09:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder what conformance criteria the hCard and hCalendar validators are based on

[09:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone know anything about this BlogML?

[09:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Are things like content-type sniffing feedback moved off the issues list?

[09:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, there they are

[09:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007Aug/0671.html> doesn't appear, yet I can't find any reply to it

[09:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finds <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Feb/0410.html>

[09:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders why on earth that isn't in his email client

[10:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Google news says "try google archives for news older than 30 days" and the newest news I can find there are from 2004 :)

[10:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: JZWSA sounds somewhat like JSLint, i.e. mostly a waste of time trying to satisfy pointlessly pedantic warnings

[10:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
("Gosh, you used this class value only once, so you could have made it an ID instead! That's a really useful thing for you to fix")

[10:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
"I ran Jeffrey Zeldman’s Web Standards Advisor on the four-year-old markup of this site’s current blog layout, and discovered embarrassing mistakes that [nobody has ever noticed or complained about because they're totally irrelevant in reality]"

[10:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me is probably being slightly unfair :-)

[11:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: the multipage version is generated by Philip` 

[11:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: is it not displayed fuly-expanded when printing?

[11:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i can't easily put the script beyond the toc without also changing the w3c version

[11:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
wakaba: np

[12:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: why doesn't the content property of CSS work on actual elements the same way it works on pseudos?

[12:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-content/#inserting suggests it should

[12:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
because that's still just a WD

[12:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[12:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It wasn't fully expanded when I tried print preview in FF2

[12:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
(or it might have been FF3, I'm not quite sure)

[12:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh, print preview is a different matter

[12:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
i thought you meant the pdf

[12:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how wrong is it to use PUA dingbats with @font-face?

[12:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
so i guess what we should do is have G generate two table of contents

[12:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
since the collapsing isn't popular

[12:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok how's that like

[12:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
new toc mechanism

[12:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
temporary, until G can do it statically

[12:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me gives up waiting for shelly to reply

[12:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: G == me?

[12:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: And what sort of TOC do you want now?

[12:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
see the spec :-)

[12:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Ah, so one with just the top level?

[12:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(Actually, the second level)

[12:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[12:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(As the top level is just "HTML 5")

[12:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, send email (<mailto:geoffers⊙gc> before you ask)

[12:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh cool. Gecko already has an html5lib tree builder test harness for mochitests

[12:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, it doesn't matter. I just blocked the script entirely because it made the spec less usable

[13:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
makes it more usable now :-)

[13:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, yeah, that is much more useful. I've unblocked the script now

[13:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
but it would be useful if that could instead be generated in the spec gen process

[13:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
with an anolis plugin

[13:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
there are a number of things i'd like anolis to do :-)

[13:37:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me knows

[13:37:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has several emails :)

[13:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: As I said, send an email about this

[13:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd rather you did the others first :-D

[13:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
It's a shame that rounded corners aren't anti-aliased in WebKit

[13:38:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: :D

[13:38:04.0000] <hsivonen>
(neither in Safari nor in Chrome)

[13:38:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: It's probably easier to just dump it in my email box at least

[13:38:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I probably won't do stuff in order anyway :P

[13:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's why i don't want to put it in your box :-)

[13:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
also, rounding em-based widths to pixels in WebKit is different for the vertical and horizontal lines and for curves

[13:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Stuff for Lachy and annevk before you, anyway :P

[13:39:03.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, what stuff from me is in your queue?

[13:39:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: biblio

[13:39:05.0000] <Lachy>
oh yeah.

[13:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i found biblio to be undesireable because the references churn so fast that the maintainer of the generator script gets tired of updating references

[13:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
and so the editor ends up having to do it manually anyway

[13:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
so if you do biblio stuff, try to work around that problem somehow

[13:41:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Well, it should be possible to automatically create a database of RFCs and W3C TRs easily

[13:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. fetch data off a wiki or something

[13:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
if only RFCs and TRs were all that was referenced...

[13:41:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, in HTML 5 they are a fair proportion

[13:41:06.0000] <Hixie>
(and are you going to regenerate the database every time you run the script? because that would be a lot of work)

[13:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't really matter what the proportion is, all that matters is whether there is a critical mass of cases that change often enough to be annoying

[13:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: No, just rebuild it per release, and include the script to re-gen it

[13:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it's certainly an improvement over doing it manually

[13:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i doubt it'll be enough

[13:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Also, custom databases can be added as well, so just add extra refs needed there

[13:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
can they be added in the source file? that would side-step my issue a bit

[13:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
if they could be added in the source file in the output format

[13:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
and all the script did was add the missing ones and reorder them

[13:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
that would be ok

[13:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Then just look within <!--begin-references--> … <!--end-references--> (or whatever the string is) for them?

[13:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And just expect it to be a dl?

[13:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
or just look for the <dl> with id=refernces

[13:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
or with class="references"

[13:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
or something like that

[13:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
also there needs to be a way to put some references in one <dl> and some in another, and a way to annotated the references (e.g. I put "Informative" next to some)

[13:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[13:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I know

[13:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
all these complications are why I gave up with automating this

[13:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, the css3 spec-gen uses <!--normative--> and <!--informative-->

[13:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(At least, that's what the docs claim)

[13:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has limited faith in the docs, though

[13:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[13:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Does selectors use css3 spec-gen biblio?

[13:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks at source and sees the give-away comments

[13:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(i..e, yes)

[13:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, did you mean selectors api?

[13:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: yeah

[13:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I have already answered my own question, though

[13:56:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah. That's why I want it supported in anolis, cause it's preventing me from switching

[13:56:04.0000] <Lachy>
though I've already switched for the html5 authoring guide

[13:56:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that's what I was guessing you used it there

[13:56:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I saw.

[13:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(insofar as the numbering is ISO 2145 compliant)

[14:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me wants a plugin that outputs non-ISO-2145 compliant numbering

[14:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes that won't be easy

[14:17:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, base it on a wiki that you scrape while running the script and fall back to a backup you have from last time you loaded the script if the network request fails?

[14:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: I like Hixie's suggestion, having thought about it

[14:19:00.0000] <annevk>
that doesn't encourage people to add them to a place for others to reuse

[14:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
indeed it doesn't, but it does leave it wide-open to name conflicts

[14:21:00.0000] <annevk>
the community will sort that out

[14:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
RDF is really fucking confusing.

[14:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: how so?

[14:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The primer at least has left me more confuse than before

[14:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Where is rdf:about actually defined?

[14:31:00.0000] <webben>
gsnedders: Hmm. Good question!

[14:33:00.0000] <webben>
gsnedders: 2.2.1 http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/

[14:33:01.0000] <webben>
I guess.

[14:33:02.0000] <webben>
"When the about attribute is specified with Description, the statements in the Description refer to the resource whose identifier is determined from the about." and the following

[14:35:00.0000] <annevk>
the newest version of that document refers to the RDF primer and therefore it does not seem to be normative

[14:35:01.0000] <annevk>
or at least the newest version isn't

[15:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: yt?

[15:12:00.0000] <heycam>
hi Hixie

[15:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
hey

[15:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
question

[15:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
how do i make an interface that has an anonymous named getter that returns values for strings that aren't properties of the object?

[15:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
[NameGetter] seems to be defined only in terms of "supported named properties"

[15:13:00.0000] <heycam>
hmm, you can't currently.  what objects need this?

[15:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
HTMLDocument

[15:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/mid/op.tzqg9y2hidj3kv⊙hpon

[15:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm trying to emulate Safari's behavior

[15:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
<img name=x><script> assert(document.x is a [HTMLImageDocument]); assert(not 'x' in document); </script>

[15:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[15:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
HTMLImageElement

[15:14:03.0000] <heycam>
i see

[15:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
anonymous name-getter, i should say, not "anonymous named getter" which is an oxymoron

[15:16:00.0000] <heycam>
:)

[15:16:01.0000] <heycam>
i'll make a note of it

[15:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[15:18:00.0000] <heycam>
/me wonders if there's a bot here that will tell me a link to this point in the irc logs

[15:18:01.0000] <annevk>
nope

[15:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
does "The name of the corresponding named property is N and will have the DontEnum attribute." mean that you can't do "for (i in foo) { }" to get the names out?

[15:19:01.0000] <heycam>
correct.  do you need to have things returned by [[Get]] that will return false when doing (prop in object) but will be enumerated?

[15:20:00.0000] <heycam>
since that'd be a violation of ecma-262, i think

[15:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think we might need that for document.all

[15:20:02.0000] <heycam>
hmm

[15:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
but i haven't looked at that yet

[15:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was wondering more about 'window'

[15:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
where the subframes get exposed to enumeration iirc

[15:21:02.0000] <heycam>
oh actually no it wouldn't necessarily be a violation, you can just define [[HasProperty]] appropriately

[15:21:03.0000] <heycam>
not that web idl allows you to override [[HasProperty]] at all at the moment

[15:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, no, i'm wrong

[15:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
about window enumeration

[15:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm sure i've seen properties exposed before

[15:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
where would that be

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
can't find anywhere

[15:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh well

[15:24:02.0000] <annevk>
I thought document.all required hacks in ECMAScript parsers

[15:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
d.all is messed up

[15:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know what we'll do for it

[15:25:00.0000] <annevk>
but I don't know the exact details since nobody wrote them down afaik

[15:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if the JS committee would deal with it for us

[15:26:00.0000] <annevk>
I've  been trying to get them to deal with <!-- without much success so far

[15:26:01.0000] <annevk>
though I haven't paid close attention to see if they made changes either, to be perfectly honest

[15:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
<!-- is easy to deal with

[15:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
and they won't do it?

[15:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
sheesh

[15:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: something else that would be useful (regarding the 'any'/DOMObject issue) would be union types for objects

[15:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: e.g. sometimes i have to return an HTMLElement or an HTMLCollection

[15:28:01.0000] <heycam>
mm

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i see

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
IE does enumerate

[15:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
btu safari does not

[15:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
maybe my request above is not necessary

[15:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me investigates further

[15:29:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[15:29:06.0000] <heycam>
such a feature wouldn't be suitable for certain language bindings

[15:29:07.0000] <Hixie>
i was wrong about 'x' not in document

[15:29:08.0000] <heycam>
but maybe in those languages it would just map to Object or whatever?

[15:30:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, so i'll remove that feature request?

[15:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[15:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
sorry abotu that

[15:30:03.0000] <heycam>
ok

[15:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
can someone who has IE up confirm that it says "2" "3" in the logs for this?: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E...%3Cimg%20name%3Da%3E%3Cimg%20name%3Da%3E%3Cscript%3Ex%20%3D%20document.a%3Bw(x.length)%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cimg%20name%3Da%3E%3Cscript%3Ew(x.length)%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E

[15:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
nevermind

[15:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me finds it is even more complicated and launches VMWare

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, IE returns 2/3

[15:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[15:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
my life just became 2018451023 times easier

[15:39:00.0000] <jcranmer>
/me sighs

[15:39:01.0000] <jcranmer>
what is with these eRDF/RDFa/RDF/whatever-the-hell-all-that-stuff-is people?

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
now what?

[15:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
i thought we actually made slight progress towards getting some problems listed

[15:40:02.0000] <annevk>
Firefox actually says 2/2

[15:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah firefox is disqualified

[15:41:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Hixie: from what I read, they're debating over which one to use or something like that

[15:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
in whatwg?

[15:41:02.0000] <jcranmer>
yes

[15:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i don't know how to direct the conversation towards problems rather than solutions

[15:41:04.0000] <webben>
jcranmer: That's because Calogero asked them why not eRDF.

[15:41:05.0000] <Hixie>
i've tried everything i know how to do

[15:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just going to delete the e-mails without problems

[15:42:01.0000] <jcranmer>
webben: well, it doesn't help that one of the people doesn't send emails with References/In-Reply-To

[15:43:00.0000] <annevk>
I've been reading all those e-mails and I'm not that much wiser, though those of hsivonen usually have good stuff

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey ojan

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: do i have to define how to handle named index 

[15:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[15:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: do i have to define how to handle name index property access when the name isn't in the list of names, or does webidl define that that returns undefined?

[15:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: (or does JS define that)

[15:47:02.0000] <heycam>
web idl defines that normal object property lookup is done

[15:48:00.0000] <heycam>
web idl defines a whole [[Get]] to use on the object, which has cases for what to do in the presence of [NamedGetter], etc.

[15:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
where is that defined?

[15:48:02.0000] <heycam>
www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#Get

[15:48:03.0000] <heycam>
(or maybe #get?)

[15:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
i found a [[put]] algorithm, but no [[get]]

[15:48:05.0000] <Hixie>
#get and #Get return nothing

[15:48:06.0000] <heycam>
oh right

[15:48:07.0000] <heycam>
sorry, misremembering

[15:49:00.0000] <heycam>
since the named/index properties are defined in terms of creating actual properties on the object, the standard [[Get]] is used

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[15:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i don't have to define that case

[15:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[15:49:04.0000] <heycam>
if overriding [[Get]] to return values for properties that don't exist on the object is needed, then a section defining a [[Get]] will be needed

[15:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
not needed yet as far as i know

[15:54:00.0000] <ojan>
hi hixie!


2009-01-13
[16:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
how on earth an i going to spec this: <!DOCTYPE html>...<img name=a><img name=a><script>x = document.a; y= document.a; w(x === y);</script>

[16:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
in safari and firefox, x !== y

[16:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
but in IE x === y

[16:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
wonder what opera does

[16:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
true in opera too

[16:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
well bummer

[16:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: "http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/source-whatwg":-11.40--11.46: error: Required attributes missing on element "label".

[16:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the <label> contains an <input>

[16:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: so that seems like a bug in the validator

[16:07:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, why would it be false?

[16:08:00.0000] <annevk>
/me also notes that in Firefox it's a NodeList while in Opera an HTMLCollection

[16:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah Firefox was disqualified a while back

[16:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
safari just returns a new HTMLCollection each time

[16:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
but IE and Opera memoise the getter

[16:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
which requires an annoying sentence to spec

[16:08:05.0000] <annevk>
it's weird, especially when you compare with e.g. document.images

[16:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[16:09:01.0000] <annevk>
if you replace the a with images Firefox does return true

[16:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
well sure

[16:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
why would it not

[16:09:04.0000] <annevk>
why would it not for a?

[16:09:05.0000] <Hixie>
there's only one .images collection

[16:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
so you can just hardcode an instance internally

[16:10:01.0000] <annevk>
there's also only one a collection per page...

[16:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
for .a you have to do all kinds of caching work

[16:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
no

[16:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
there might not be an 'a' collection at all

[16:10:05.0000] <Hixie>
in fact most names don't have a corresponding colleciton

[16:10:06.0000] <Hixie>
collection

[16:12:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess that's fair enough, though it seems weird for the two to be different to me

[16:12:01.0000] <annevk>
anyway, how does "The images attribute must return an HTMLCollection rooted at the Document node, whose filter matches only img elements." ensure that the same object is returned each time?

[16:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
the spec currently doesn't ensure it

[16:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
for .images

[16:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh wait

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually it does

[16:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
An attribute that returns a collection must return the same object every time it is retrieved.

[16:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess that means i don't have to define it explicitly for the getter either

[16:44:00.0000] <rubys>
http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/01/12/IE8-Beta-7000-Bug

[16:44:01.0000] <rubys>
/me wonders whether or not the IE8 team is aware of his blog, or if they just don't care

[16:46:00.0000] <annevk>
they have a bug database

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
IE bugs frighten me

[16:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can't even begin to imagine what their code must look like at this point

[16:47:01.0000] <rubys>
annevk: how do I access their database?

[16:50:00.0000] <annevk>
https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/Feedback is it I think

[16:50:01.0000] <rubys>
oh, and Hixie: I got final approval to travel to MountainView to meet with the ECMAScript folks on the 27th-29th; we could meet on the afternoon/evening of the 27th?

[16:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
january?

[16:51:00.0000] <rubys>
yes

[16:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
hold on

[16:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[16:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
what time?

[16:52:00.0000] <rubys>
when I make flight arrangements and I'll back to you, but if you can "pencil me in" for now, I'd appreciate it.

[16:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[16:52:02.0000] <annevk>
r2645 is weird

[16:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: blocked out 3pm to 8pm on the 27th

[16:52:04.0000] <rubys>
annevk: it requires me to sign in.  Once I do so, I get a The content that you requested cannot be found or you do not have permission to view it.                         

[16:52:05.0000] <annevk>
I've read the topic, but still

[16:53:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, :/

[16:53:01.0000] <annevk>
rubys, maybe blog that too, they might find it one day or you could tell the other chair ;)

[16:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: if you think that's fun you should see the next checkin (same thing, but for Window...)

[16:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
(might not be the very next one)

[16:54:02.0000] <annevk>
/me will check tomorrow

[16:54:03.0000] <annevk>
nn

[16:54:04.0000] <Hixie>

rubys: The IE8 bug database is invitation-only

[16:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: I think I have an invitation code somewhere which you could have

[16:57:00.0000] <rubys>
*sigh*

[16:57:01.0000] <rubys>
brb

[16:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
i have access but i can't say it's ever helped me (or helped me help them)

[16:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
it makes bugzilla look positively easy to use

[16:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me has reported some bugs which got fixed, though he doesn't know if they got fixed because of his bug report

[16:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i can tell the engineers don't interact with that bug database

[16:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
which makes it pretty pointless to me

[17:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, JZWSA sounds like the QA tools I've seen come and go over the past 5+ years. Nothing new and I'm amazed at it costing $50 when it's not even a standalone application.

[17:27:01.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, how about linkifying e-mail addresses and mailto: links? http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090112#l-513

[17:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, could linkification infer http:// when it's absent? http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090113#l-104

[17:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
heycam, there's no bot, but you can go to the web interface and click the # character at the start of the line manually to get this: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090113#l-25

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: yt still?

[18:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm wait

[18:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
nm

[18:20:00.0000] <hallvors>
/me tried googling JZWSA and was asked if I meant JEWS

[18:20:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Heh. I tried using Japanese characters for labels in a google chartserv request, and it turned everything in the chart into a different font :)

[18:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hallvors, JZWSA is referring to this: http://www.zeldman.com/2009/01/12/jeffrey-zeldmans-web-standards-advisor/

[18:35:00.0000] <hallvors>
BenMillard: thanks :)

[23:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: if you're still here: how do i say that my anonymous [NamedGetter] overrides the other attributes on the interface?

[23:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh wait, i may have decided i didn't need that

[23:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
no, i do need it after all

[23:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i need to be able to say that document.body is overriden by the [NamedGetter] if there is a conflict

[23:16:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, no way to do that currently.  all interface members take precedence of named properties.

[23:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have a feature request :-)

[23:16:02.0000] <heycam>
:)

[23:17:00.0000] <heycam>
/me notes it

[23:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[23:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
wanna guess a syntax so i can use it now, or should i leave an XXX?

[23:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
(either is fine by me)

[23:19:00.0000] <heycam>
if you can think of a good name to put on the attribute

[23:20:00.0000] <heycam>
[OverridesNamedProperty]?  a bit long maybe.

[23:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
[NamedGetter=OverrideBuiltins]

[23:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
maybe?

[23:20:03.0000] <heycam>
but you don't want it to apply to all

[23:20:04.0000] <heycam>
just to particular members, no?

[23:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i can tell, document.foo returns applicable elements with name=foo rather than returning the interface-defined document.foo for all values of foo

[23:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i could be wrong

[23:21:02.0000] <heycam>
oh, so is that the other way around from what you said first?

[23:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe, i've been very confused today

[23:22:01.0000] <heycam>
:)

[23:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
let me get you an actual testcase

[23:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0D%0A...%3Ciframe%20name%3Dbody%3E%3C%2Fiframe%3E%3Cscript%3Ew(document.body)%3C%2Fscript%3E

[23:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
IE says "[object Window]" in the log

[23:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
meaning it returned the iframe's contentWindow

[23:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
rather than the HTMLBodyElement

[23:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
as one would expect if the channel's topic didn't apply

[23:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i can tell that is true for all values of 'body'

[23:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. document.links

[23:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
does that make sense?

[23:24:01.0000] <heycam>
so for objects that implement HTMLDocument, a named property always overrides something from prototypes?

[23:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
looks that way

[23:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have not yet found a counter-example at least

[23:25:01.0000] <heycam>
ok

[23:25:02.0000] <heycam>
just do [NamedGetter=OverrideBuiltins] for now and i'll think about naming later

[23:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
k cool thanks

[23:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: hmm, i was going to say that you missed this case <iframe name=x></iframe><embed name=x><script>w(document.x[0])</script> but it seems the spec matches ie, webkit and opera

[23:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
returns the <iframe> element, right?

[23:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
not a Window?

[23:47:03.0000] <zcorpan>
right

[23:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
good :-)

[23:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
man the stuff i specced today puts the topic to work

[23:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
indeed :)

[23:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: are you in Linköping?

[23:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>

[00:07:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: sure

[00:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: done

[00:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: thanks

[00:25:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: I think it was just a mistake

[00:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
has a version shipped with that bug?

[00:25:02.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: I don't really care which way we go on property name precedence in the window, as long as we can all do the same thing

[00:25:03.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: I don't think so

[00:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok well then we should probably do what the comment says

[00:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
though you should fix the spelling of 'toolbar' when you fix it

[00:26:02.0000] <weinig>

heycam: if you're still there... Apparently I need a new kind of [Replaceable].

[01:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: for event handler DOM attributes

[01:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: they have to be able to take a string, at which point they do nothing

[01:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: but if later they are set back to a function, they work again

[01:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: also, if set to anything other than a string or a function, they throw an exception

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: do you know what the current state of things is w.r.t. [Null] in WebIDL?

[01:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: specifically, i seem to recall you raised an objection to the current text

[01:14:02.0000] <annevk>
that discussion didn't move

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
bummer

[01:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: fixed.

[01:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i found an object for which i need enumeration (i.e. for which I don't want [DontEnum]) - Storage

[01:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: thanks

[01:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: same object also supports indexed properties that I _don't_ want enumerated, fwiw

[01:24:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, what's the use cases for data: URL form submission?

[01:24:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, mostly debugging?

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[01:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
considering how well "power of Java" and "power of RDF" are doing, we should probably avoid advertising "power of HTML5"

[01:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
lord, i hope nobody says anything about the "power" of HTML

[01:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: now I should probably locate emails about Validator.nu bugs over the last three months or so and reply that the bugs have been fixed...

[01:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
HTML can kick Chuck Norris's ass

[01:40:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yup

[01:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
HTML probably couldn't kick _my_ ass

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
and i'm no ass-kicker

[01:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
our open Web standards platform is like the dictionary definition of "worse is better" or "good enough is good enough" or whatever cliche you want to use that asserts that the most successful technology is usually a disaster :-)

[01:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
sadly what makes something useful and widely used isn't the same as what makes it aethetically pleasing

[01:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

/me hopes it's clear now

[02:14:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, since you're still awake, any ETA on a new definition of "scripting context"?

[02:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
is that test not wrong?

[02:15:01.0000] <annevk>
no

[02:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
two things match, but only one is in the expected output?

[02:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
also the title is very misleading :-)

[02:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
no ETA on scripting context issue

[02:15:05.0000] <annevk>
oh wow, fail

[02:17:00.0000] <annevk>
/me updates test

[02:17:01.0000] <annevk>
/me somehow missed the second element

[02:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: thanks, synced up and running now

[02:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but fwiw, some tests are failing with:

[02:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>

heycam: i find the text in "3.8.5. [IndexCreator], [IndexDeleter], [IndexGetter] and [IndexSetter]" and "4.4.2. Indexed and named properties" to be confusingly different

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: they both have what look like normative conformance criteria and language defining what is should say, but it is defined in different terms

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: so i don't know if what i'm doing is right

[02:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i'd prefer to see the JS one defined in terms of the generic one

[02:59:00.0000] <Hixie>

welcome to logicfreezone

[03:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm guessing this is an IE8 bug

[03:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
because even for IE, this is crazy land

[03:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
IE6 says typeof is 'string'

[03:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
(stringifying to '[object]')

[03:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
so what exactly is .item then?

[03:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
i know that form.elements === form

[03:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
(in IE)

[03:03:04.0000] <Hixie>
but what is form.item?

[03:03:05.0000] <annevk>
nice, just like window.frames

[03:03:06.0000] <Hixie>
since when are strings callable?

[03:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's not a string, it's just an object whose type is string :-)

[03:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
indeed, it's definitely not a string, you can't index into it for example

[03:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
<!DOCTYPE html><form><input></form><script>w(document.forms[0].item[0])</script> -> undefined

[03:04:03.0000] <annevk>
btw, <form><input> without an "x" or something in front of it gives you a fucked up DOM

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh so it does

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think this is affecting these results though

[03:05:02.0000] <zcorpan>
<form><input type=hidden> makes the input be in head

[03:06:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, document.forms[0].item == document.forms[0] but not ===

[03:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yeah, you're just stringifying both if you do that

[03:07:00.0000] <annevk>
I see

[03:09:00.0000] <annevk>
funny, item[0] is undefined ,as you say, but item(0) is object

[03:11:00.0000] <annevk>
for(x in document.forms[0].item) doesn't reveal anything

[03:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why is that funny? With function f(){return null}, f[0] is undefined and f(0) is object, so it's not particularly unusual behaviour

[03:12:01.0000] <annevk>
Isn't it just the IE way to denote a function?

[03:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
<!DOCTYPE html>...<form><select><option>x</select></form><script>w(document.forms[0][0]('0'))</script>  ->  [object HTMLSelectElement]

[03:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
...

[03:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
what?

[03:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
in fact, it returns that for any value of the argument

[03:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
BUT

[03:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
<!DOCTYPE html>...<form><select><option>x</select></form><script>w(document.forms[0][0]())</script>  ->  undefined

[03:13:03.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Not sure what you mean

[03:15:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought that maybe the weird behavior of item was normal

[03:15:01.0000] <annevk>
doesn't seem like it

[03:15:02.0000] <annevk>
funny when you compare .item with .namedItem

[03:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
i am so confused right now

[03:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is worried that trying to understand IE may leave Hixie in no state to edit the spec. Or do anything really. Except go with the nice men in their white coats

/me gets worried too now

[03:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think it safe to assume that this bit of IE was implemented by repeatedly getting a cat to walk over the keyboard until something compiled

[03:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think cats could design something so perverse

[03:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if heycam would fall for it if i told him i needed something to spec the last thing i pasted here

[03:27:00.0000] <annevk>
how would that even work?

[03:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
just like in IE!

[03:27:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Magic

[03:27:03.0000] <annevk>
how does it even work, I should say :)

[03:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow

[03:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
IE doesn't index on <option name="">

[03:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
only <option id="">

[03:30:03.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, shouldn't that be w(f]'a']); (using square brackets, not parentheses)?

[03:30:04.0000] <Lachy>
oops, I meant w(f([a']);

[03:30:05.0000] <Lachy>
aargh. you know what I mean.

[03:30:06.0000] <Hixie>
i'm testing (and speccing) the Callable=namedItem behavior

[03:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
the NameGetter=namedItem behavior is a separate kettle of rotten fish entirely

[03:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh. I didn't know that you could call it as a function. Does it work in any browser except IE?

[03:31:02.0000] <annevk>
/me looks forward to this week in HTML5, should be easy to write: "There be dragons."

[03:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: at least one case works in safari

[03:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh jesus

[03:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
select.item('a') actually returns something

[03:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
works just like .namedItem('a')

[03:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
i hope nobody minds if this part of the spec isn't 100% IE compatible

[03:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
but I don't think I can actually spec what IE does without violating some fundamental laws of physics

[03:33:01.0000] <annevk>
you're saying IE beats physics?

[03:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe our understanding of physics is flawed

[03:34:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and the real world is more like ie

[03:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me hopes Bell's theroem doesn't apply to IE

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
that would be bad

[03:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's all just spooky action at a distance

[03:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I couldn't get that above script to work in either Firefox, Opera or Safari

[03:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm actually more worried that the theory expounded upon at the start of the The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is the one that applies here

[03:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i don't think any of them do this for option and select, no

[03:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Did the latest version of IE8's developer tools remove the DOM-properties view? I can't find it anywhere

[03:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I meant this one: <form><input name=a></form><script>var f = document.forms[0]; w(f('a')); w(document.forms[0]('a'))</script>

[03:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
it only works in IE

[03:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i don't think callable forms is supported by the others either

[03:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe f.elements('a')?

[03:44:00.0000] <annevk>
that should be identical to f('a')

[03:44:01.0000] <annevk>
in IE anyway

[03:45:00.0000] <annevk>
we could copy that in HTML5 I think

[03:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's already in html5

[03:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh actually that one isn't

[03:46:00.0000] <annevk>
then we could drop HTMLFormControlsCollection

[03:46:01.0000] <annevk>
I suppose

[03:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't intend to

[03:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
but we could

[03:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh actually it is already in html5, sorry

[03:46:05.0000] <Hixie>
i was confusing it with something else

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, not in my copy

[03:47:01.0000] <annevk>
"  readonly attribute HTMLFormControlsCollection elements;"

[03:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought you were saying we should make elements callable

[03:51:00.0000] <annevk>
no, I meant removing that interface in favor of just having <form>

[03:52:00.0000] <annevk>
might not be needed though, just an idea

[03:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, we could. i don't intend to.

[03:52:02.0000] <annevk>
it would be nice if [Callable=namedItem] and all were inside the interface def

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
if you link to e.g. HTMLFormElement you won't see it

[03:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno how to change that

[03:53:02.0000] <annevk>
alternatively we could do one interface per <pre> and have the linking work differently

[03:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's either heycam's problem or gsnedders'. :-)

[03:54:01.0000] <annevk>
well, heycam could just move them inside... :)

[03:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
not without breaking compat with OMG IDL

[03:54:03.0000] <annevk>
well, one interface per <pre> is also years

[03:54:04.0000] <annevk>
I see

[03:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: it's unfortunate that for the enumeration stuff i have to first list how to get the list of names, then list how to get the mapping of name to value

[03:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: since those two operations are so similar

[04:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i'm taking a break

[04:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
before i lost my sanity

[04:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
forms are crazy

[04:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
dom level 0 is crazy

[04:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
IE is crazy

[04:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
all three together = crazitasticness

[04:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does anyone still have IE8b2?

[04:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
If so: Does <!DOCTYPE html><svg xmlns=x> give an element called 'svg' inside HEAD, or an element called 'SVG' before HTML?

[04:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It gives the former in IE8RC1, and parses elements inside there with its normal XMLish rules rather than its normal HTML ones)

[04:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and it does that for seemingly any unrecognised element, with an xmlns attribute that contains at least one character)

[04:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
in the dom viewer, "<!DOCTYPE html><svg xmlns=x>s" says:

[04:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://junkyard.damowmow.com/350

[04:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
ie8b2

[04:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: ^

[04:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
Thanks

[04:13:03.0000] <Philip`>
Look like it's changed in RC1, then

[04:13:04.0000] <Hixie>
what do later beta do?

[04:13:05.0000] <Philip`>
*Looks

[04:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: They give:

[04:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
HTML

[04:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
  HEAD

[04:14:03.0000] <Philip`>
    TITLE

[04:14:04.0000] <Philip`>
    svg xmlns="x"

[04:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
and you can write <svg xmlns=x><foo><bar/><baz/></foo></svg> and it'll parse into the same kind of tree as if it were XML

[04:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
and without the xmlns?

[04:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Without that, it does the same as IE8b2 (which is the same as IE7 and IE6)

[04:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
so basically they just added xmlns="" as a way to do what used to be only possible with a prefix?

[04:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[04:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how many pages that breaks

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
given how common xmlns="" attributes are

[04:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's only on unrecognised elements, so it won't affect most

[04:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love how they still support style="", onclick="", etc, on these elements

[04:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
what happens with things like:  <html>...<foo xmlns="">...<input type=submit> ?

[04:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
You get a submit button

[04:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
so e.g. <svg xmlns=""> ... <font> ... <script> ... </svg> wouldn't have svg <font> amd <script> elements?

[04:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
<svg xmlns=x><font color=red>Hello</font></svg> is rendered as red text

[04:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
(with the FONT element being a child of the svg element)

[04:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
good times

hsivonen: I notice you changed the content model for colgroup

[05:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
how are you having validator.nu enforce the constraint that a colgroup with a col child can't have a span attribute?

[05:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
colgroup = (col* | colgroup.attrs.span?) & colgroup.attrs

[05:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: it's quite possible that I'm not

[05:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: it seems you changed the content model in r371

[05:34:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
in table.rnc

[05:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I added span, but I forgot about the child restriction in that case

[05:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I think it worked as expected the way you had it before

[05:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>

namespace without documentation: http://wordpress.org/export/1.0/ :/

[07:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: WXR isn't even XML anyway

[07:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: WP's WXR parser totally ignores namespaces, too.

[07:52:02.0000] <annevk>
that's all cool, I just need to be able to write it so WordPress can consume all my content

[07:52:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: It basically uses regexes to parse it

[07:52:04.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: OK, make sure you use CDATA blocks where WP does.

[07:52:05.0000] <hsivonen>
WP seems to have given up on its ideals since it overtook MT as the most popular blogging platform

[07:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I'd argue before that, but hey

[07:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: are you migrating from your own system to WP?

[07:53:02.0000] <annevk>
I was thinking about it, yes

[07:53:03.0000] <zcorpan>
why?

[07:53:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Would you argue that giving up on its ideals was a necessary factor in its becoming the most popular blogging platform?

[07:53:05.0000] <annevk>
to more easily get OpenID support and all

[07:53:06.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Take a look at Habari.

[07:53:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No

[07:53:08.0000] <Lachy>
woah. I wouldn't. Personally, I want to migrate away from WP to my own system. I just don't have time to write it

[07:53:09.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Oh, okay then

[07:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me points towards #habari

[07:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
With wonders such as: output as HTML!

[07:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Using a serializer to create XML!

[07:54:03.0000] <gsnedders>
All these bizarre things.

[07:55:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, does Habari describe an import format I can generate?

[07:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Admittedly, no

[07:55:02.0000] <annevk>
/me doesn't find it in the documentation

[07:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: does it use an html5 parser and serializer?

[07:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: No

[07:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
s9y,wordpress,MT,blogger importers.

[07:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
Habari looks nice. I might have to give it a try

[07:58:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe I should just generate a bunch of static pages of all content I have so far and start over...

[07:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: How's it stored currently?

[07:59:00.0000] <annevk>
table for posts, table for comments, table for tags, some linking between them, iirc

[07:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
How much is stored as XML? Comments are, aren't they? Posts too I assume?

[08:00:00.0000] <annevk>
"XML fragments"

[08:00:01.0000] <annevk>
they actually don't have a root in the database

[08:00:02.0000] <annevk>
so I can use string concat in the end :)

[08:00:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I think that'll probably be the hardest part of moving to any other system: any other system assumes HTML or HTML-compat XHTML :)

[08:02:00.0000] <annevk>
it stores Atom IDs as well, has two different summary fields, etc.

[08:02:01.0000] <annevk>
two different title fields too

[08:02:02.0000] <annevk>
one text/plain and one with markup

[08:03:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess I might lose those features if I switch, hmm :/

[08:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That's not going to be fun moving with.

[08:04:00.0000] <rubys>
/me is perpetually rewriting his own blog engine, this time in Ruby

[08:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: I'd ask in #habari about keeping things like that

[08:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has no idea how hard it'd be

[08:06:00.0000] <rubys>
if you look at blosxom, you can see how easy it can be.  And deceptively so.

[08:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: can't the text/plain version be generated from the markup version?

[08:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notices that IE8's compat view button affects all *.iki.fi subdomains if activated on one. Not good.

[08:08:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I suppose, if you have a good fragment parser in place and some logic

[08:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: what logic is needed?

[08:10:00.0000] <annevk>
expanding abbreviations maybe, dunno, haven't thought about it or studied what I've done so far

[08:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is the "parser pause flag" something that's going to stay around once you take into account the script execution model feedback from Apple and Opera?

[08:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: .textContent?

[08:11:02.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wonders if Olivier should take email summaries less literally and try reading the spec instead

[08:11:03.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, wouldn't expand abbreviations

[08:11:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah

[08:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
why would you want to expand abbreviations?

[08:13:00.0000] <annevk>
to keep the same info in the text/plain version

[08:13:01.0000] <annevk>
is this really relevant?

[08:13:02.0000] <annevk>
/me goes back to work

[08:24:00.0000] <annevk>
I suppose I could consider writing a subset of an XML5 parser (one that ignores DOCTYPES and silly things) and serializer and use that to do my blog, but then I'd still have to fix OpenID support somehow and things like that

[08:25:00.0000] <rubys>
for your application, why an XML5 parser?  Why not simply an HTML5 parser?

[08:26:00.0000] <annevk>
an HTML5 parser is not simple :)

[08:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
"import html5lib"

[08:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
That's easy enough :-)

[08:26:03.0000] <annevk>
in PHP?

[08:26:04.0000] <rubys>
why PHP?  :-)

[08:26:05.0000] <zcorpan>
aren't there html5 parsers written in php?

[08:26:06.0000] <annevk>
that's what I have now and it's rather fast :)

[08:26:07.0000] <Philip`>
Pipe the text from PHP through an external Python process :-)

[08:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's silly to be constrained by only using a single language at once

[08:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Get a less silly web host?

[08:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Ping @azyang

[08:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the WHATWG spec doesn't have 2009 in the copyright notice

[08:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Also, PHP is really slow

[08:28:04.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, DreamHost is not that bad, is it?

[08:28:05.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, usually when I do something with Python it's much slower, but I think I get the setup wrong

[08:28:06.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Dunno but the specgen was much slower for you on dreamhost than for me on webfaction

[08:29:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, I wonder if it was due to way I configured everything

[08:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
PHP--the new COBOL? :-)

[08:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Maybe. But Dreamhost is silly because it only provides really outdated python by default

[08:29:03.0000] <annevk>
anyway, rewriting everything in Python is even more work :)

[08:30:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, true, though you are allowed to install your own, which sort of offsets that when you figure out how

[08:30:01.0000] <zcorpan>
"If you want to produce application/xhtml+xml, you are free to do so. If you get it right, no one will notice. If you get it wrong, no one will forgive you." - http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/XHTML_vs_HTML

[08:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Yes but that means you have to install your own which introduces the possibility of configuring it badly

[08:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
(although I did also install my on on webfaction the default of 2.4.3 is not so bad)

[08:31:01.0000] <annevk>
fair point

[08:31:02.0000] <rubys>
zcorpan: I got it wrong once, do you forgive me? :-)

[08:31:03.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: You don't need to rewrite everything in Python, just use it as a tag-soup-to-DOM conversion tool and import the resulting DOM into PHP

[08:31:04.0000] <Philip`>
and then you don't have to go to all the effort of implementing an XML5 parser in PHP :-)

[08:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: What version of Anolis does pms use?

[08:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: no, you need to learn your lesson and stop doing silly string concat :P

[08:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: 285:0570e687a80b

[08:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has a vague memory of that being 1.0

[08:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
However, I am wrong

[08:35:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I just pulled the tip

[08:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
There's one commit since

[08:35:04.0000] <jgraham>
That souds wrong, somehow

[08:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
tip should be 286

[08:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
286 changes body to sectioning root from sectioning content (following Hixie's change of HTML 5)

[08:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: It'd be nice if stopping doing silly string concat let you be certain you were generating well-formed XML, but it never seems to work that well in practice :-(

[08:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Yes, that's what I have now

[08:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: If it breaks the spec, it's Hixie's own fault :)

[08:38:00.0000] <rubys>
Phillip` +1

[08:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
(... e.g. the surrogate-character (I think?) bug in Xalan (I think?) that hsivonen encountered)

[08:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me blames his bozoness on Lotus

[08:40:00.0000] <rubys>
Meanwhile, I just got http://rails.intertwingly.net/blog/index.html to the point where it renders acceptably on IE8 beta 7000, Opera 9.63, safari 3.2.1, firefox 3.0.5, and chrome 1.0.154.43.  WOOT!

[08:42:00.0000] <olliej>
rubys: i'd be worried if you got something rendering correctly in safari 3.2, but not chrome

[08:42:01.0000] <olliej>
rubys: given they're both running off the same webkit branch

[08:43:00.0000] <rubys>
I have some javascript on my weblog... and you can actually see the differences in the two if you look at dates

[08:44:00.0000] <olliej>
rubys: oh, i assumed you were talking about layout

[08:44:01.0000] <olliej>
rubys: they have a completely different js engine

[08:44:02.0000] <rubys>
html5 layout without javascript is broken on IE8

[08:45:00.0000] <olliej>
rubys: so their date logic is likely different... although i find myself wondering how date's could vary at all

[08:45:01.0000] <olliej>
regardless of browser

[08:45:02.0000] <olliej>
O_o

[08:45:03.0000] <rubys>
dates are the same, it is the toString and toLocaleString method that differ

[08:45:04.0000] <annevk>
oh, we have had our share of dates issues as well

[08:46:00.0000] <annevk>
e.g. getYear and getFullYear iirc

[08:46:01.0000] <olliej>
morning annevk 

[08:46:02.0000] <annevk>
good afternoon olliej :p

[08:46:03.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: The "Explore" box on the right has rounded corners but an ugly rectangular border around them, in Opera 9.6something :-(

[08:46:04.0000] <rubys>
safari: Sunday, January 11, 2009 13:52:02; chrome: Sun Jan 11 2009 13:52:02

[08:47:00.0000] <annevk>
does ECMA allow both?

[08:47:01.0000] <olliej>
annevk: back in nl?

[08:47:02.0000] <olliej>
annevk: it's ecma

[08:47:03.0000] <Philip`>
and the comment boxes with rounded corners have a white background behind the cut-out bit of the corner

[08:47:04.0000] <annevk>
yes

[08:47:05.0000] <rubys>
Phillip`: that shows a partial svg experiment that I never completed

[08:47:06.0000] <olliej>
annevk: why would you expect it to define anything?

[08:47:07.0000] <Philip`>
(rather than the proper background colour)

[08:47:08.0000] <rubys>
I'll back that out later today

[08:48:00.0000] <annevk>
olliej, I guess it's naive to assume specs are useful

[08:48:01.0000] <rubys>
opera has a cool ability to use svg in css, but its usefulness is limited by the fact that you can't do svg inline in css

[08:48:02.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: what if IE9 implements createElementNS but doesn't change the parser?

[08:48:03.0000] <olliej>
annevk: well, esp. ecma262

[08:48:04.0000] <rubys>
zcorpan: then I'll react accordingly.

[08:48:05.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: but maybe there will be hundreds of people copying your code and won't

[08:49:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, E4C? :)

[08:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: Konqueror from KDE4 seems to work pretty well too

[08:49:02.0000] <annevk>
euh, C4X or something

[08:49:03.0000] <Philip`>
(But I can't test the KDE3 one because somehow it's got totally corrupted)

[08:49:04.0000] <rubys>
then don't copy my code. :-)

[10:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does Opera 10 have any upcoming CSS features that no other browser has yet?

[10:05:00.0000] <annevk>
WebKit has SVG as background as well now right?

[10:06:00.0000] <annevk>
/me isn't really sure what exactly is in Opera 10 to be honest

[10:06:01.0000] <rubys>
Phillip`: I got rid of the rounded corders with square edges on Opera.

[10:07:00.0000] <rubys>
not sure if this answers hsivonen's question, but opera 9 supports svg as backgrounds in css

[10:07:01.0000] <annevk>
true

[10:07:02.0000] <annevk>
we support SVG fonts referenced from @font-face, but I think WebKit has that too

[10:10:00.0000] <annevk>
of interest here might be "Removed UTF-32 encoding support"

[10:10:01.0000] <olliej>
annevk: yup

[10:10:02.0000] <olliej>
annevk: S3.1 has that :D

[10:12:00.0000] <rubys>
why remove UTF-32 (other than the obvious: nobody uses it)?

[10:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: implementation and QA cost

[10:13:00.0000] <rubys>
wouldn't have expected either to be that high for something already implemented...

[10:14:00.0000] <annevk>
just unneeded complexity

[10:15:00.0000] <annevk>
no need to support more charsets than necessary :)

[10:15:01.0000] <annevk>
/me hopes we can bring it down to some fixed list at some point

[10:15:02.0000] <annevk>
of course, someone might complain about distributed extensibility when that happens, but we can deal with that :p

[10:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I want <meta charset="http://www.example.com/translation-table-for-my-funky-encoding.xml">

[10:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
The existing values can be interpreted as URIs relative to http://www.w3.org/2009/charsets# and it'll all be fine

[10:17:02.0000] <rubys>
I want utf-8 to be the default, but we can't all have what we want.

[10:18:00.0000] <annevk>
just include a BOM

[10:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks most people here would want UTF-8 to be default

[10:18:02.0000] <rubys>
annevk: you are kidding, right?  (I hope you are kidding...)

[10:19:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, you don't like a BOM? you could use HTTP instead, doesn't really matter :)

[10:19:01.0000] <annevk>
/me wasn't kidding about the fixed list of charsets though

[10:19:02.0000] <annevk>
and that goal seems sort of realistic

[10:19:03.0000] <rubys>
I use HTTP's charset.

[10:20:00.0000] <annevk>
given enough time to investigate what browsers support and ways to lock it down, separate it from OS charset support, etc.

[10:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that failing to support encodings can be a security issue

[10:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Why separate it from OS charset support? Surely that's an extra impl. cost?

[10:21:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, well, at least have some layer in between that limits or extends what is supported so that it is the same everywhere

[10:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: It just seems like an extra layer for bugs

[10:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
(e.g. some servers let you select what charset the response will be in, and if you choose one that your victim's browser does not support, you can perform an XSS attack by including safe characters which get encoded into bytes that are decoded by the browser as '<')

[10:23:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, not supporting the same charsets is also a source of bugs

[10:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Inevitably. Which has the greater cost, though?

[10:24:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, not supporting the same charsets makes sites unusable...

[10:25:00.0000] <annevk>
what happened to mr last week btw?

[10:25:01.0000] <annevk>

http://jacobian.org/writing/descriptivists-and-prescriptivists/

[10:43:00.0000] <annevk>
hober, seems we do both, just not fast enough?

[10:44:00.0000] <hober>
Well, perceived speed and actual speed are probably pretty different in this case... people don't understand what the timeline means.

[10:47:00.0000] <takkaria>
that article says <canvas> is non-standardised

[10:48:00.0000] <webben>
well that's true, it isn't standardized

[10:48:01.0000] <webben>
it's just in progress towards standization.

[10:49:00.0000] <webben>
though "completely-non-standardized" is over emphatic, perhaps

[10:51:00.0000] <annevk>
"

[10:51:01.0000] <annevk>
Look, Flash video is a standard. Every browser under the sun will play a YouTube video. A descriptive view of the web would recognize that Flash has won the web video war, and design a <video> container around that. Instead, we get Ogg. Great."

[10:51:02.0000] <annevk>
"I want specs that encapsulate how the web actually works, not how a group of academics wish it worked."

[10:51:03.0000] <annevk>
I guess he meant more than what I summarized above judging from this comment on his own article

[10:52:00.0000] <rubys>
If you could go back a few years, you could replace that with "Look, IE5 is a standard.  Every site under the sun will work with it.  A descriptive view of the web would recognize that IE5 has won the web war, and would design a HTML5 standard around that.  Instead we get WHATWG.  Great"

[10:53:00.0000] <gavin>
heh

[10:53:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I know a browser that doesn't play YouTube video

[10:53:02.0000] <jcranmer>
it's called elinks

[10:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
NOWAI

[10:53:04.0000] <jcranmer>
there's also links, lynx, etc...

[10:53:05.0000] <jcranmer>
links2, IIRC

[10:54:00.0000] <rubys>
I downloaded safari yesterday on Windows.  It didn't either.  I had to install something called a 'plug-in'.

[10:54:01.0000] <jcranmer>
while I'm in a complaining mood, why won't people make websites look decent in text browsers?

[10:54:02.0000] <jcranmer>
or even usable?

[10:54:03.0000] <gavin>
because no one uses text browsers

[10:54:04.0000] <rubys>
jcranmer: I can't speak for all people, but I can say that I have tried to make my website look decent in text browsers.

[10:55:00.0000] <jcranmer>
gavin: another way of putting the usability aspect

[10:55:01.0000] <jcranmer>
don't rely on javascript if you don't have to

[10:55:02.0000] <jcranmer>
/me glares at blackboard

[10:55:03.0000] <gavin>
"the usability aspect"?

[10:56:00.0000] <takkaria>
hmm, the author seems to say one needs a balance of prescriptivism and descriptivism, and then in the comments implies that he actually really just wants to be a descriptivist

[10:56:01.0000] <jcranmer>
making websites usable in text browsers

[10:57:00.0000] <gavin>
in that case I  have no idea what the thing just said to me was supposed to convey

[11:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems strange to call the WHATWG "a group of academics", since very few members of it are academics

[11:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or is the descriptivist approach to say that the term "academics" simply means "any group of people who I want to insult because they think differently to me"?

[11:36:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe more like "any group of people who has nice ideas that will never fly in the real world"

[11:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I think that's missing the connotations that the people being referred to are clueless about the real world

[11:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Obviously "real world" is entirely subjective and means "the way I currently view the world")

[11:39:01.0000] <annevk>
sure, and obviously not everyone thinks our ideas are nice...

[12:10:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip', "real world" is only entirely subjective if discussed theoretically. if OTOH, one responds to claims of something being (or not being) "real world" with [citation needed] then we can argue based on data/examples/sampling of natural phenomena which tends to better approximate the "real world".

[12:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: for example, Sun's JDK doesn't come with a UTF-32 decoder. It would be silly to require me to write one or to require HTML parsers to require ICU4J to support something no one uses outside of test suites.

[12:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: supporting encodings is a security issue too. Consider IE and Safari & EBCDIC.

[12:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: I downloaded Windows 7 beta, and IE8 didn't play Flash video out-of-the-box...

[12:24:01.0000] <rubys>
hsivonen: what you are talking about is subtly different?  You are describing what encodings the spec REQUIRES, and the original question was what encodings an implementation choses to implement...

[12:25:00.0000] <rubys>
I would think that a browser that ran on a mainframe might, for example, support EBCDIC; but I wouldn't mandate that every browser does so.

[12:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: supporting EBCDIC is potentially harmful in a security way. supporting UTF-32 is harmful is an opportunity cost way

[12:25:02.0000] <annevk>
wouldn't that be bad, because that would mean mainframe content becomes walled gardened

[12:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: I think we should ban all the encoding that we can ban practically

[12:26:01.0000] <rubys>
good luck with that

[12:27:00.0000] <rubys>
a parser on a mainframe that can't parse files found on the local hard disk would be only of, ahem, academic interest.

[12:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: why would HTML files on the local drive be EBCDIC rather than e.g. UTF-8?

[12:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: they do have byte-oriented storage, right?

[12:28:01.0000] <rubys>
because they were produced using ISPF/PDF

[12:28:02.0000] <rubys>
I programmed on mainframes for over a decade.  The short answer to that question is no.

[12:28:03.0000] <hsivonen>
scary

[12:29:00.0000] <rubys>
The dominant format for files was (FB 80) which meant that every line took 80 characters, after that point the next line started.

[12:29:01.0000] <annevk>
but you can put a proxy between the browser and the content

[12:29:02.0000] <annevk>
rubys, sweet

[12:30:00.0000] <rubys>
annevk: forget browser for a minute, consider a conforming html5 parser, pointed to a file on a hard disk.

[12:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, it seems to me that it's more up to the mainframe world to interoperate with the rest of the world by developing UTF-8 text editors and byte-oriented storage than up to the rest of the world to complicate stuff to accommodate mainframe peculiarities

[12:30:02.0000] <annevk>
yeah, NEL and XML 1.1 come to mind

[12:30:03.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: I'd want that file to be in UTF-8 regardless of platform.

[12:30:04.0000] <rubys>
/me mutters something about academics and ivory towers

[12:31:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, fair enough, but something that fixes the encoding should be possible even on mainframes, right?

[12:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I consider NEL harmful

[12:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: how do mainframes read PNG files?

[12:31:03.0000] <rubys>
The rest of the world needs to change to accommodate your view of the world.  Gotcha.

[12:32:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, to a certain extent that is true, yes, people can't write <foo> as root element for HTML documents either, for instance

[12:32:01.0000] <gavin>
part of the rest of the world needs to change to accommodate the rest of the world

[12:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: like XML changing to accommodate IBM mainframe view of the world? :-)

[12:33:00.0000] <annevk>
heh

[12:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in retrospect, it wasn't such a great idea to specify SGML in terms of mainframeish "records" and pretend that CRLF magically morphs into record boundaries by fictitious record start/ends getting inserted and immediately removed

[12:35:00.0000] <rubys>
gavin: a html5 parser on a mainframe reading a text file needs to change to support what?  Let's be clear: nobody is arguing that EBCDIC should be REQUIRED.  I'm just pushing back on the notion that any encodings can be PROHIBITED.

[12:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: fwiw, I'm OK with an HTML5 parser on a mainframe supporting EBCDIC for local files as long as nothing EBCDIC-encoded ever goes over the HTTP wire

[12:36:01.0000] <gavin>
I'm suggesting that the mainframe needs to change to support be able to support an html5 user-agent

[12:37:00.0000] <rubys>
/me chuckles

[12:37:01.0000] <rubys>
One can certainly send XHTML as EBCDIC and have it work with parsers that have installed the right encoding support.

[12:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
I thought the whole point of it being a mainframe was that it hadn't changed since the 1960s :-)

[12:37:03.0000] <rubys>
HTTP certainly would not prohibit such

[12:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: that's an interop problem

[12:38:01.0000] <rubys>
yup

[12:38:02.0000] <rubys>
So is sending PNGs to lynx.

[12:38:03.0000] <hsivonen>
in fact, the whole encoding thing is a huge interop loophole in XML

[12:39:00.0000] <gavin>
I am aware that changing mainframes is not exactly trivial!

[12:39:01.0000] <annevk>
encoding is a huge interop problem on the Web as well

[12:39:02.0000] <annevk>
e.g. sites trying to exchange data with each other

[12:40:00.0000] <rubys>
yup.  And I would agree that a BCP (in IETF terms) document describing the set of encodings that are widely supported would be a Good Thing.

[12:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a good reason why NEL maps to an Unicode character of its own instead of the EBCDIC to Unicode conversion mapping it to LF?

[12:41:01.0000] <rubys>
http://feedvalidator.org/docs/warning/ObscureEncoding.html

[12:41:02.0000] <rubys>
brb

[12:42:00.0000] <rubys>
back

[12:44:00.0000] <rubys>
I guessing that NEL is to distinguish between the (uncommonly used but actual) CR and NL characters and the virtual new lines that are inserted between record boundaries.

[12:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how do mainframes deal with the octet-orientedness of IETF protocols?

[12:47:00.0000] <rubys>
(records consist of octets, but nevermind) Web servers on mainframes certainly support common encodings for interchange.  For text files on disk, an EBCDIC to some encoding based on ASCII is performed.  For that reason, it would probably be a good idea if HTML5 parsers on a mainframe could process the same files.

[12:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: that's not the kind of area HTML5 tries to be normative about

[12:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me looks up the answer to a similar issue in the context of a theoretical mobile device

[12:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I located the thread: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-comments/2008Jan/0071.html

[12:53:00.0000] <rubys>
"I don't see how it is practical for HTML 5 to have a blacklist of encodings that should not be supported." +1

[12:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the reply I wanted to reuse is http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-comments/2008Jan/0076.html

[13:11:00.0000] <annevk>
/me reads http://realtech.burningbird.net/semantic-web/semantic-markup/stop-justifying-rdfa "Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to combine documents found on the web with any degree of confidence." and wonders how you can do that without much additional processing to determine whether either or both resources are in fact not spam

[13:13:00.0000] <takkaria>
it irritates me that RDF's inate logic of subject-predicate was shown to be inadequate in describing the world back in 1892

[13:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
me smiles at 'In other words, begin with the assumption that RDF has value in, and of itself, and does not need to be "justified".'

[13:16:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, that's quite a cop out

[13:17:00.0000] <annevk>
if that were true we should add SMIL support to HTML5...

[13:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
as usual, her RDFa example omits the ns decls

[13:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
with ns decls, RDF becomes like this: http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/12/13/-big/XMLporn.jpg

[13:19:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, it's terrible, see e.g. the site linked from http://twitter.com/markbirbeck/status/1112827320

[13:19:01.0000] <annevk>
(which also still uses DTDs for some odd reason)

[13:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that's a lot of ontologies minted by one domain holder...

[13:21:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh, christ

[13:21:01.0000] <takkaria>
the london gazette site is terrible...

[13:25:00.0000] <annevk>
the contrast between our efforts to simplify markup and what the XHTML2 WG is up to is striking

[13:25:01.0000] <annevk>
and might be worth some blog post to highlight the differences at some point :)

[13:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's not really a fair comparison unless HTML5 has a mechanism for expressing the same kind of data

[13:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: shouldn't the comparison be on the use case and syntax levels? after all, the differences in data expression would be the thing to compare

[13:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, presupposing a certain data model defeats the purpose of comparison

[13:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Yes - I just mean it'd be unfair to strip out all the xmlns stuff and all the RDFa attributes, and replace it with <!doctype html> and say "look how simple it is now!"

[13:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: isn't that pretty much what Shelley's example is?

[13:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and RDFa examples in general usually

[13:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No idea, I haven't read that blog post

[13:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm just responding to the incredulity at the london-gazette site)

[13:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
'There is no confusion about what each of us "means", when use use "subject".' 

[13:43:01.0000] <takkaria>
does anyone know how Google give you the useful links under the first result?

[13:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a controlled vocabulary for the values of subject?

[13:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: partly sitemap, I think, but I guess it's not all sitemap


2009-01-14
[16:31:00.0000] <annevk>
seems some people commented on the article while I was out :)

[16:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
?

[18:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: what do i need to set [PrototypeRoot] on?

[18:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: do i need it on things like HTMLCollection or MediaError?

[18:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
(things that i expect to have interface objects but that have no ancestors?)

[18:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: i'm not sure it makes sense to have 

[18:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
[ImplementedOn=Node]

[18:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
interface EventTarget

[18:59:03.0000] <heycam>
things that have no ancestors, but which you expect will have descendants, and objects of which will also implement mixins

[18:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
...given that EventTarget is implemented on many other objects

[18:59:05.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[18:59:06.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, do you think it should be the other way around?

[19:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know that it can be either way around

[19:00:01.0000] <heycam>
mm

[19:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
spec wise, it happens both ways

[19:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. EventTarget was defined after Node but before XMLHttpRequest

[19:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
but it's implemented on both

[19:00:05.0000] <Hixie>
(my history might be wrong there but you get the idea)

[19:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe it makes more sense to have something like PrototypeRoot

[19:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
"i expect to have things say that they are implemented on me"

[19:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe in fact it can replace PrototypeRoot, since you can work out if it's a _Root_ by seeing if it is, well, a root.

[19:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
i may be talking nonsense.

[19:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: it appears i just set "NoInterfaceObject" on objects that i don't expect to have unique prototype objects or that i expect to have implemented on other objects

[19:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i also set it on interfaces that are to be implemented by the author)

[19:04:02.0000] <heycam>
it's not that they don't have unique prototype objects

[19:04:03.0000] <heycam>
just that they aren't exposed through a property on the window object

[19:05:00.0000] <heycam>
so it really just means "don't put that property on the window object"

[19:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
[ImplementedOn] basically means it doesn't have a unique prototype object, no?

[19:07:00.0000] <heycam>
er, lemme think a minute =)

[19:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[19:08:00.0000] <heycam>
[ImplementedOn] would cause properties from that interface to be in the prototype chain on a special mixin prototype object, that gathers all of the mixins together

[19:09:00.0000] <heycam>
so yes, there wouldn't be a unique prototype object

[19:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok so for those objects, i currently (also) set NoInterfaceObject

[19:09:02.0000] <heycam>
ok, that makes sense, because you otherwise would think you're affecting the prototype when you're not

[19:09:03.0000] <heycam>
does any browser expose EventTarget.prototype?

[19:10:00.0000] <heycam>
and have it do what you might think it does?

[19:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
and i'm not sure that it's useful to set ImplementedOn= on them, since often those interfaces are implemented on multiple different objects, and that's why i have them as separate interfaces in the first place

[19:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
i have no idea

[19:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
right now i have no useful testable browsers in front of me

[19:11:00.0000] <heycam>
iirc, using [ImplementedOn] would cause fewer mixin prototype objects to exist

[19:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
well how do i say that NavigatorID is implemented on both HTML5's Navigator and Web Workers' Navigator?

[19:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
(especially given that i don't want to mention workers in html5)

[19:13:01.0000] <heycam>
yeah, that's a problem, i see

[19:14:00.0000] <heycam>
i don't know for sure if the current prototype chain stuff required by web idl is acceptable to everyone

[19:14:01.0000] <heycam>
assuming it is, and that there is a good reason to have mixin prototype objects that are distinct from the "host object mixin prototype objects"...

[19:14:02.0000] <heycam>
... then would it make sense to also have a [Implements]?

[19:14:03.0000] <heycam>
to indicate the reverse of [ImplementedOn]?

[19:15:00.0000] <heycam>
you know, you could just use inheritance

[19:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
it would make the idl blocks strangely organisation-biased

[19:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'd rather have a totally separate mechanism for declaring it outside of an interface

[19:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. the way that a multimethod is declared independently of either interface in languages that have multimethods

[19:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
(or just have it in prose)

[19:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
on a different note, is there say way to say "i just want this interface to literally be implemented by that other interface in certain cases"?

[19:16:02.0000] <heycam>
yeah, so the downside of declaring that in prose is that you wouldn't be able to just use a tool that parses the idl and generates appropriate prototype chain code

[19:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. WindowModal vs Window

[19:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
basically i want WindowModal to look exactly like Window, just with two additional attributes

[19:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
class name should be Window

[19:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
everything should look like it's a Window

[19:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
it just needs to have two additional attributes

[19:17:04.0000] <heycam>
hmm

[19:17:05.0000] <heycam>
no, there's no way of doing that currently

[19:17:06.0000] <Hixie>
there's never both a Window and a WindowModal

[19:17:07.0000] <Hixie>
basically the global object is one or the other

[19:18:00.0000] <heycam>
why not make WindowModal inherit from Window?

[19:18:01.0000] <heycam>
you don't want the prototypes set up that way?

[19:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't want to expose the word WindowModal

[19:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
nor have any extra prototypes

[19:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
a similar but not identical case: i have to split the definition of HTMLDocument into two, for various reasons, defined in different specs (or different chapters, at least).

[19:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do i say that the two IDL blocks should be treated as the same IDL block split in two?

[19:20:00.0000] <heycam>
for the WindowModal thing, inheritance sounds like the right solution.  if you don't want separate prototypes then i suppose something could be introduced to force it to be "flattened" into one, and to be able to control [[Class]].

[19:21:00.0000] <heycam>
that, or duplicate the interface and still have something that can control [[Class]]

[19:21:01.0000] <heycam>
for the two IDL blocks, is this for the bgColor stuff etc.?

[19:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[19:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
doublec (or anybody): do you have a local copy of the OMS PDF you could post somewhere, at least temporarily?

[19:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
just mailed you these three topics as remineders

[19:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
i have to go eat

[19:22:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.openmediacommons.org/ doesn't seem to be responding

[19:22:05.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, ok thanks

[19:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like i don't have any interfaces that should have PrototypeRoot, fwiw

[19:24:01.0000] <doublec>
MikeSmith, yep

[19:24:02.0000] <doublec>
I'll get the url

[19:24:03.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, yeah i'd expect them to be in the DOM specs

[19:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
EventTarget and Node seem like the only obvious ones

[19:25:00.0000] <doublec>
MikeSmith, http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/OMS-video-v0.9.pdf

[19:25:01.0000] <heycam>
yeah

[19:25:02.0000] <heycam>
no..

[19:25:03.0000] <heycam>
EventTarget isn't a prototyperoot

[19:25:04.0000] <heycam>
Node is

[19:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh?

[19:25:06.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[19:25:07.0000] <Hixie>
right

[19:25:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
doublec: thanks very much

[19:25:09.0000] <heycam>
because you want EventTarget to be one of the mixins

[19:25:10.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[19:25:11.0000] <Hixie>
i have things that then get implemented by EventTarget

[19:25:12.0000] <Hixie>
which confused me

[19:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
RemoteEventTarget is implemented by anything that implements EventTarget

[19:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
and right now has an ImplementedOn=EventTarget decorator

[19:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
hope that doesn't confuse WebIDL too much!

[19:26:03.0000] <heycam>
that.. makes sense doesn't it?

[19:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
i hope so, i haven't read that part of webidl carefully

[19:27:01.0000] <heycam>
[ImplementedOn=A] interface B;   basically should just mean "if a host object implements A, then it also implements B."

[19:27:02.0000] <heycam>
perhaps i should write up at one point what's currently specced wrt prototype chains separately from Web IDL, so that the general idea can be reviewed more easily

[19:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
does it define where the mixins slide in on teh chain?

[19:28:01.0000] <heycam>
it's the most speculative part of the spec

[19:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[19:28:03.0000] <heycam>
yes it does

[19:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[19:28:05.0000] <Hixie>
then it should be fine

[19:28:06.0000] <heycam>
but it defines something that no browser currently implements =)

[19:28:07.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well

[19:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
right. going afk for food.

[19:29:01.0000] <heycam>
i'm probably a bit busy for web idl work over the next couple of weeks, so i'll probably not get to your requests until later

[19:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[19:47:00.0000] <heycam>
btw i like the term "WebIDLize" :)

[20:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
just saw this about "Updated Getter/Setter Syntax in IE8 RC 1" on the IE Blog: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/01/13/responding-to-change-updated-getter-setter-syntax-in-ie8-rc-1.aspx

JSON compatibility, DOM prototypes, "embracing ECMAScript 3.1"

[23:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Is there an implementation of OMS Video? How does it compare to Theora?

[23:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I don't think there are any implementations of OMS Video yet

[23:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
But I would suspect that Sun is working on some kind of reference implementation

[23:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok.

[23:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, great to see that IBM's patents on arithmetic coding have been expiring lately. OMS and Dirac both use arithmetic coding.

[23:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but I guess JPEGs will be Huffman coded forever due to backward compat anyway :-/

[23:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
two new TAG participants: John Kemp (Nokia) and Larry Masinter (Adobe)

[23:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yep

[23:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: btw, have you ever come across the "Element “html” from namespace “http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml” not allowed in this context." errors for your test files tests/html5full-html/valid/002.xhtml and so on ?

[23:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm trying to figure out if it's a local problem in my environment, or a known issue.

[23:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I don't see that here.

[23:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
But now I do see one unrelated test failure...

[00:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: hmm, maybe I should check out a fresh local copy and build from that

[00:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: can i put [Optional] in [NamedConstructor] decorators, or should I just list the overloads?

[01:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.sans.org/top25errors/ contains errors relevant to the usual HTML/RSS/XML bozoness

[01:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me eyes http://trac.webkit.org/export/39885/trunk/LayoutTests/fast/forms/old-names.html suspiciously

[01:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
that looks uncanningly like a massive rathole of pain that i'm going to be forced down

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: 3, 4, and 5 are all specific occurances of 2

[01:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: indeed.

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is there a reason why there's a separate parser pause flag instead of comparing script nesting to zero?

[01:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[01:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
you don't set it to true if the nesting is non-zero

[01:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
you only set it to true once you run into one of hte situations where you're waiting for a pending script, iirc

[01:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
and then it stays true until you wind back down to false

[01:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
er

[01:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
back down to zero

[01:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is that something that's likely to stay or something that Opera and Apple asked you to rewrite?

[01:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
this doesn't have anything to do with the issue you are aluding to

[01:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
so likely to stay

[01:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok. thanks

[01:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
(the issue in question is to do with calling scripts in a document that isn't the active document, or in a document on which document.open() has been called)

[01:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. the bits that currently freeze the "script group".

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ah

[01:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
interestingly, Gecko has managed over ten years without the nested script counter

[01:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it was added sometime between October and mid-December last year

[01:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
how does it handle this case then?

[01:15:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I don't know.

[01:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[01:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it now has a nested script counter for *some* purpose

[01:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
this can also be implemented by resetting the flag at the outer event loop or something like that

[01:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
kind of an implied counter

[01:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if i can someone convince heycam that webidl should support this http://trac.webkit.org/export/39885/trunk/LayoutTests/fast/forms/old-names.html nonsense natively

/me ponders

[01:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
vml is used to implement canvas and svg in ie with js

[01:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
seems to work in the "rc1" build though

[01:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: the connect.microsoft page seems to be secret

[01:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: vml didn't work in ie8b1 in ie8 mode

[01:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
only in ie7 mode

[01:36:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, DOMString <span title="dom-canvas-toDataURL">toDataURL</span>([Optional] in DOMString type, [Variadic] in any args); seems wrong

[01:37:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, because that would mean the [Variadic] could be the first argument as well which is not true

[01:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
your understanding of WebIDL is wrong

[01:38:00.0000] <annevk>
ok

[01:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[01:57:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, you can use [Optional] in the [NamedConstructor]

[01:57:01.0000] <heycam>
use whichever you think looks nicer of that and the overloads

[01:58:00.0000] <heycam>
/me "o_O"s at the .../forms/old-names.html thing

[01:59:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, but you should be able to define that yourself just by stating which named properties exist at a given time

[01:59:01.0000] <annevk>
so [Optional] means omit this and all arguments following this?

[01:59:02.0000] <heycam>
annevk, yep

[01:59:03.0000] <heycam>
counterintuitive?

[01:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: k. i'll avoid the nested decorators for now. might change it later.

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: oh i know i can define it myself. just hoping i can get out of it :-D

[02:00:01.0000] <heycam>
heh

[02:00:02.0000] <annevk>
heycam, seems fine, was slightly confused at first

[02:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
re [optional], i think it's the behavior we want, the name maybe could be better

[02:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what to suggest though

[02:00:05.0000] <heycam>
[ThisAndTheRestOfTheArgumentsCanBeOmitted]

[02:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
toDataURL(Optional [ in DOMString type, [Variadic] in any args ])

[02:05:00.0000] <annevk>
that might not be compatible with OMG IDL, but I dunno really

[02:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me thinks [Optional] is fine

[02:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is compatibility with OMG IDL important?

[02:09:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, Web Workers twitter messages don't link to http://html5.org/tools/web-workers-tracker

[02:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: shouldn't open</span>([Optional] in DOMString type, in DOMString replace); be open</span>([Optional] in DOMString type, [Optional] in DOMString replace); ?

[02:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: what do they link to?

[02:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: which open is this?

[02:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
+  <span>HTMLDocument</span> <span title="dom-document-open">open</span>([Optional] in DOMString type, in DOMString replace);

[02:14:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, they link to the Web Workers draft

[02:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: fixed (i'd commented out the right link since you hadn't set it up yet)

[02:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
you'll be glad to know that with Web Sockets I am just reusing HTML5's infrastructure (and extracing the docs straight out of the HTML5 source) so that there's no need for yet another tracker

[02:19:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders why the ECMAScript comittee decided to change getter/setter syntax; http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/01/13/responding-to-change-updated-getter-setter-syntax-in-ie8-rc-1.aspx seems like an interop disaster rather than being helpful, but maybe I'm missing something

[02:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: thanks fixed

[02:19:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, setting up trackers is easy now, just a one line file ;)

[02:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[02:24:00.0000] <heycam>
Philip`, it's likely much less important than i thought it would be at the outset

[02:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
toDataURL([in DOMString type, *[in any args]])

[02:27:00.0000] <heycam>
that's compatible syntax, but less usefully compatible

[02:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It's interesting how Mozilla, Opera and Google can get away with shipping wrong-sized browser app icons for Vista and Windows 7

[02:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
If someone tried to ship OS X apps with wrong-sized icons, users would reject such an app

[02:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, installers still show an occasional Windows 3.1-era icon under Windows 7...

[03:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: html5lib-discuss google group has two spam files uploaded to it. They direct the browser to somewhere that is blocked as attack sites in Firefox.

[03:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Fixed. Thanks

[03:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me adds another example of extension to the FAQ

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk>
can someone explain to me when you use "same origin" and when you use "non same origin"?

[04:08:00.0000] <annevk>
sorry

[04:08:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: http://validator.whatwg.org/ has the old name of hsivonen's service

[04:08:02.0000] <annevk>
when you use "same origin" and when you use "same-origin"

[04:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
you use "same origin" when "origin" is the last word in the phrase, and "same-origin" when that forms a single adjective form for another noun.

[04:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
so "this is the same origin" and "this is the same-origin policy"

[04:09:02.0000] <annevk>
great, thanks

[04:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: fixed

[04:23:00.0000] <annevk>
does the same apply to "server side"?

[04:24:00.0000] <annevk>
google says it does

[04:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: we're probably going to keep our pixelratio impl

[04:42:00.0000] <annevk>
shouldn't HTML5 say "in an ASCII case-... manner" rather than "in a ASCII case-... manner"?

[04:42:01.0000] <annevk>
i.e. an vs a

[04:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me gets confused when an email entitled "250 years of Robert Burns" turns out to be about the Scottish poet

[05:04:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, finds "WebSocket is cross-origin." shouldn't cross-origin there have been without the dash?

[05:04:01.0000] <annevk>
having to edit a technical spec with terms that are not in common usage in English sucks

[05:06:00.0000] <annevk>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy ...

[05:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i seem to remember chaals saying that there were no rules and people do it both ways

[05:07:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, that might be correct

[05:10:00.0000] <annevk>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphen#Compound_modifiers has advice

[05:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: The Chicago Manual of Style has rules

[05:11:01.0000] <annevk>
it seems you can do it safely without for same origin and cross origin

[05:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
albeit the rules have a weird thing

[05:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
CMoS says it's Civil War–era rather than Civil War-era

[05:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
en dash vs. hyphen

[05:12:02.0000] <annevk>
which would make the name of the spec "Cross Origin Resource Sharing"

[05:12:03.0000] <annevk>
yeah, Wikipedia has a bunch of that stuff too

[05:13:00.0000] <annevk>
which seems fine, since Cross does not modify Resource or Sharing in any way, right..?

[05:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd have written Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

[05:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but I don't have a specific rule to appeal to

[05:14:00.0000] <annevk>
i'd like to either consistently use a hyphen or consistently not or have a rule that says when to use it and when not

[05:14:01.0000] <annevk>
and have it somehow made clear when that rule applies and when not...

[05:20:00.0000] <annevk>
I'll do cross origin and same origin for now, point that out on the list when I've done my edits and ask for advice there so someone can bikeshed it and everyone can be happy

[05:21:00.0000] <annevk>
actually, never mind, it's going to be too much of a hassle

[05:28:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk2, "Cross Origin Resource Sharing" mean "Angry Origin Resource Sharing". :)

[05:28:01.0000] <annevk>
fair enough

[05:28:02.0000] <annevk>
I'm annevk again btw, not annevk2 :p

[05:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, oops, legacy content problem

[05:29:01.0000] <annevk>
fortunately I'm more HTML than XML; maybe even more flexible, as I don't think <html2> means <html> in any user agent

[05:30:00.0000] <BenMillard>
fwiw, cross-threaded describes when a nut and bolt are misaligned, or the lid for a bottle

[05:30:01.0000] <BenMillard>
so there's a precedent for cross-something

[05:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
cross-ply tyres have a structure which goes back and forth and is stacked up in layers

[05:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's cross-examining and cross-checking etc too

[05:34:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, oh yeah...I guess there's a whole class of cross-something compounds as a precedent for cross-origin.

[05:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
 but those probably aren't relevant since they're not used as adjectives

[05:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
or maybe they're not relevant because the adjectival form (cross-examined etc) is a normal adjective prefixed by "cross-"

[05:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
whereas "origin" is never an adjective, so "cross-" is not just a modifier of that word; it's making a whole new word instead

[05:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this is going to be a major game-changer: http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20090114-nokia-qt-lgpl-switch-huge-win-for-cross-platform-development.html

[05:38:01.0000] <annevk>
you guys should review my drafts for spelling :)

[05:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: What value would be added to your documents by having them spell-checked?

[05:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
(There's no point spending much effort being correct solely out of a desire to be correct :-) )

[05:41:00.0000] <Lachy_>
annevk, I don't really see the problem with the current name. Though I don't really care that much if it's renamed

[05:41:01.0000] <annevk>
k

[05:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, you could use a spelling checker? (If your HTML editor doesn't do spell checking, you can copy-paste the text into a word processor, then correct the source from what the word processor finds.)

[05:42:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, less room for ambigiuity, as BenMillard pointed out

[05:42:02.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, I suppose...

[05:42:03.0000] <BenMillard>
only worth doing that once it's pretty stable, though

[05:42:04.0000] <hsivonen>
are there any good open-source English grammar checkers?

[05:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: LGPL Qt sounds pretty nice - I couldn't find any alternatives to wxWidgets when writing a GUI for a not-quite-open-source project, so it's good if Qt is now usable in those situations

[05:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder what the chances of getting a unified Linux desktop are now

[05:48:00.0000] <annevk>
well, with Android underway, having just one is not quite going to happen I think

[05:48:01.0000] <annevk>
though maybe Android will never be for desktop despite the rumors

[05:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, some Googling reveals a couple of open source grammar checkers but both were 0.x rather than 1.x versions. Also found this rather pessimistic description about the lack of success in this area: http://faq.cooldictionary.com/english-grammar-checker.php

[05:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Things seem to be moving in the opposite direction - I have Gtk applications, Qt3 applications and Qt4 applications

[05:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: thanks

[05:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: is Android's GUI toolkit on the Java layer on the one below?

[05:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me supposes it'd be easy to argue that grammar checkers destroy our language, by discouraging anyone from writing anything interesting and non-formulaic

[05:51:02.0000] <annevk>
on the (fake) Java layer

[05:51:03.0000] <annevk>
afaik

[05:51:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I see.

[05:51:05.0000] <annevk>
that was the "disadvantage" of it, all popular Linux apps wouldn't run on it

[05:52:00.0000] <annevk>
at least according to the articles I read; and given what they write about HTML5, I'm somewhat suspicious :p

[05:52:01.0000] <BenMillard>
lol

[05:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I'm getting used to the Google icon, but for some reason I keep thinking it's for organic milk or fruit juice or something of that ilk...maybe that's a good look to have captured.

[05:53:01.0000] <BenMillard>
those things are the epitomy of not being evil, after all

[05:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, maybe the reason is dark green along the bottom and bright blue along the top

[05:54:01.0000] <BenMillard>
I guess the red is like a sunset and the yellow like a corn field, too

[05:55:00.0000] <Lachy_>
BenMillard, I still hate the google icon. Though I find it funny that it looks like a slightly warped version of the AVG icon rotated 90˚ and the Windows icon rotated 180˚

[05:55:01.0000] <annevk>
/me likes it a lot more than the blue one

[05:56:00.0000] <annevk>
it's highly visible and different from other favicons

[05:57:00.0000] <Lachy_>
I preferred the blue g over the current icon, though liked their original one with the G in the box with coloured sides better

[05:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
The G in the box looks very old-fashioned to me

[05:57:02.0000] <BenMillard>
the new one has rounded corners! it's web 2.0!

[05:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the blue lowercase g was lame

[05:59:00.0000] <Lachy_>
the "Favicon Mobile" version of that was better http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7ZYqYi4xigk/SEnKfGpULuI/AAAAAAAAApw/2AqOUkg2Dz0/s1600-h/favicon_family.jpg

[05:59:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, those are nice, but at 16x16 in Firefox 2 it was lame. :)

[06:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
They should use an animated GIF as the favicon

[06:21:00.0000] <annevk>
twitter has this expansion function for URLs but you still have to go through the shorter URL service after expanding...

[06:59:00.0000] <annevk>
the IE getter and setter stuff is completely different it seems

[06:59:01.0000] <annevk>
http://ajaxian.com/archives/next-ie-8-release-candidate-to-have-updated-gettersetter-support-and-dom-prototypes seems toally incompatible with http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-getters-and-setters/

[07:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
"do we [...] pursue implementing the ECMAScript 3.1 getter/setter API for the DOM, or do we ship what we have [i.e. the de factor API that is mutually supported by several other major browsers and programming environments] and tackle the ECMAScript 3.1 API in a future release?

[07:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
"The answer really came down to what was best for the web developer; they need interoperability and by ensuring that we support getters/setters as outlined in ECMAScript 3.1, we help deliver that interoperability in the long-term."

[07:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
Web developers need interoperability, and so IE chooses to ship something that is different to what everyone else is shipping? Seems a strange notion of interoperability...

[07:05:03.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[07:05:04.0000] <annevk>
/me is planning to blog something to that effect

[07:05:05.0000] <annevk>
though it seems the ECMA-comittee is also to blame

[07:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Presumably the origin of the strangeness is ECMAScript 3.1 adding the feature in a different way to what's implemented

[07:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
("This decision was made with the concurrence of all the major browser vendors including those who currently support the de facto getter/setter API.")

[07:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which doesn't make it seem less strange, though admittedly I have absolutely zero knowledge of the new API and how it differs and why any decisions were made)

[07:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it seems the ie8 examples use "getter" while other browsers use "get"

[07:12:01.0000] <annevk>
IE also has prop.getter and afaik there is no prop.get in other browsers

[07:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me is pretty confused at this point, should probably do some actual testing instead of reading

[07:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
javascript:foo={get test(){ return "foo"; }};alert(foo.test); doesn't work in ie8

[07:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Do IE8 compatible examples fail to compile in other browsers or do they just not work?

[07:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I don't see anything in any documentation that suggests that ought to work

[07:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/12/15/Co-Chair-HTML-WG#c1231946437

[07:20:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: is it not correct es3.1?

[07:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thought the idea was to standardize the de facto syntax established in Gecko/Spidermonkey

[07:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: foo={}; Object.defineProperty(foo, "test", { getter: function() { return "foo" } }); alert(foo.test); is what the ES3.1 .doc linked from the IEBlog post appears to say

[07:25:00.0000] <rubys>
i really don't even know how to begin to respond to Michael Tomer.

[07:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: the V.nu parser in svn now passes html5lib tests again

[07:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could say that his suggestion has been seen by members of the WG with implementation experience, and they do not believe it is a technically feasible approach

[07:29:00.0000] <rubys>
it apparently is possible, but being possible isn't the answer to the problem he sees.

[07:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I belive the html5lib tests are out of date on some issues around heading parsing or something

[07:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I fixed that today

[07:34:02.0000] <takkaria>
oh, yay, that means I can get hubbub back up-to-date with miminal work :)

[07:34:03.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: they were also out of date wrt. </form>

[07:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Great.

[07:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me will fix that in html5lib soonish

[07:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I am sort of working on the MathML+SVG stuff at the moment for which I made some large changes to support the possibility of namespaces so I guess I should fix regressions from that first)

[07:38:01.0000] <annevk>
/me posted http://annevankesteren.nl/2009/01/gettters-setters

[07:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Do we put HTML elements in the HTML namespace or not yeT?

[07:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: We don't do anything yet

[07:41:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[07:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
But I am adding an option for whether or not to put HTML elements in the HTML NS because AFAIK things like etree can be pretty annoying to work with if you have namespcaes mixed in

[07:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, they can be

[07:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
But in Anolis it'd be a lot nicer to just always have stuff in the HTML namespace to support both HTML and XHTML.

[07:43:00.0000] <rubys>
hsivonen: you probably already told me, but is there a way to kick off running v.nu against the html5lib tests?

[07:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Otherwise I need to duplicate tag names, with their un-namespaced form for HTML and their namespaced form for XHTML.

[07:43:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Like I say I plan to support both with a option to HTMLParser()

[07:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/a/an/

[07:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me was going to do that some time, but is unlikely to do it for several months, so is rather pleased that someone else cares enough to do it for him

[07:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[07:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well at the moment I have no extra functionaility and a whole bunch of regressions (because I decided to pass the tokens from the tokenizer through the treebuilder rather than splitting up stuff at the start)

[07:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
(which means refactoring everything and may not even be a very good design)

[07:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
I hope it's not going to have any performance regressions :-)

[07:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: fwiw, it seems (form source; I didn't actually test) that Gecko treats the meta prescan charset as confident

[07:48:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I think it might :( 

[07:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: :'-(

[07:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Rewrite it in C!

[07:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Since I can't say anything polite I won't say anything at all.

[07:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[07:50:02.0000] <jgraham>
Wait...

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I think there is significant value in a pure-Python HTML5 parser

[07:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. you could use it on Google App Engine

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I'd like the pure-Python html5lib to be as good (i.e. fast) as possible

[07:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
regardless of any chtml5lib that someone else might make

[07:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But it's still slow.

[07:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It's slow in comparison to C/Java/etc, but it's fast in comparison to what html5lib would be like if there hadn't been any attempts to optimise it

[07:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
(it is *really* fast compared to the first version that passed the tests :) )

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
and it's not terribly slow in comparison to other pure-Python angle-bracketed-markup parsers

[08:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
When people strike-through phrases in a kind of ironic way like "I think that's a<s>n incredibly stupid</s> very novel idea", what is the appropriate semantic element to use?

[08:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm sure I've asked this before but I can't remember any convincing answers...)

[08:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It sounds like you need EmotionML! Although you will first have to write your own emotion ontology that defines sarcasm. ANd then you will need to pick a numerical value for how sarcastic you were being (on a scale you get to define)

[08:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
And then you will have to convince Hixie that you have a valid use case for emotionML-in-HTML. I suggest proceeding by first construcing a EmotionML->RDF mapping and then lobbying for RDFa-in-HTML on the basis that you need to define just how sarcastic you are in a way that machines can understand

[08:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
But all I want is some stricken-though text :-(

[08:27:00.0000] <rubys>
<del>

[08:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: If machines can't understand how sarcastic you are how can they respond appropriately, e.g. by presenting more sarcastic error messages to you? Won't someone think of the machines!

[08:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: That's for text which has been removed from the document, and in this case nothing has been removed - all the text has been there intentionally from the very beginning, and it would lose its meaning if anything was removed

[08:28:01.0000] <rubys>
"But all I want is some stricken-though text"

[08:28:02.0000] <rubys>
you can get that through css or through del.  Apparently you want more.

[08:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Well, I want it to be conforming HTML5 too

[08:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Actually I don't, but for the purposes of this IRC channel I'm pretending that I do)

[08:30:01.0000] <rubys>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through">

[08:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also I want it to be media-independent, so it can't rely on visual CSS

[08:34:00.0000] <rubys>
For someone who says "all I want is some stricken-though text", you certainly have a lot of requirements.

[08:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm just <del>contradicting myself</del> treating them as basic, implicit requirements that underlie all HTML questions :-)

[09:28:00.0000] <exarkun>
Does html5lib parse this document correctly according to the spec?   <title>hi<foo>bar</foo><body>hi</body>

[09:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
exarkun: Yes - <title> is RCDATA, so any tags except </title> are treated as plain text rather than as actual tags, so it's equivalent to <html><head><title>hi&lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;/foo&gt;&lt;body&gt;hi&lt;/body&gt;</title></head><body></body></html>

[09:40:00.0000] <exarkun>
So a missing </title> could eat a whole document

[09:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
exarkun: Yes

[09:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
exarkun: which seems to match IE and Opera

[09:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
exarkun: (though Firefox seems to re-parse the content if it reaches EOF without ever seeing a </title>)

[09:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Did you make changes that would have broken "echo 'test' | python parse.py -"? (It now dies with "IOError: [Errno 29] Illegal seek" inside detectBOM)

[09:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (and I'm sure it used to work at some point in the past)

[09:44:01.0000] <exarkun>
Philip`: Thanks for the info

[12:02:00.0000] <annevk>
so since it seems people are still confused with this I thought I'd blog about it, the technical issue with integrating RDFa is xmlns right, no others?

[12:02:01.0000] <annevk>
that is, xmlns in XML cannot be selected using [xmlns] where it can when you use it in HTML because XML puts it in a namespace and HTML does not

[12:04:00.0000] <annevk>
of course you could build an API on top of this that abstracts away the differences, dunno, but you'd kill namespaces in HTML in the process

[12:05:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/01/michael_chertof.html :)

[12:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: the only issue as far as i am concerned is that i don't know what it's for (there's been a couple of use cases presented, but so far nowhere near enough to justify all of RDF as a solution, IMHO)

[12:53:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, agreed

[12:55:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems worthwhile to point out anyway, so people might realize sending RDFa in text/html is harmful rather than just invalid

[12:55:01.0000] <annevk>
though maybe at this point it is too late anyways


2009-01-15
[21:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
IE blog says support for Access Control is completed for the next public release of IE8: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/01/14/completing-access-control-support-for-xdomainrequest.aspx

[22:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=350052 - they closed my bug as wontfix seemingly without looking at the tests

[22:27:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me has now reopened and removed tests that pass in ie8

[23:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: getting "Bad MD5 hash for http://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.7.0-bin.zip."

[23:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
when I try to build from fresh checkout

[23:03:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I remember this happening before

[23:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, but seems to be OK after I re-started the build

[23:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://esw.w3.org/topic/PF/XTech/MarkUp/Hybrid

[23:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: words of wisdom

[23:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
though "Validating only fragments of a document, where each fragment is of a different document type than the other fragments in the document, is beyond the scope of this framework - since it would require technology that is not yet defined." is not actually correct

[23:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wonder what the context was for Gregory writing up that page

[23:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.w3.org/2009/01/14-pf-minutes.html (search for "hybrid") (W3C Member-only)

[23:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: fwiw, after doing a fresh checkout, I'm no longer seeing the "Element “html” from namespace “http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml” not allowed in this context." errors

[23:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: is there any way to do a "distclean" or "clean" with your build setup? (short of checking out fresh sources)

[23:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: thanks

[23:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
interesting

[23:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i thought cdf were focusing on filling the gaps in specs when they were used in the same document - not particularly addressing validation

[23:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: yeah, that sounds correct as far as I understand it

[23:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I didn't really follow CDF when it was active

[23:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and it hasn't been active for quite a while now

[23:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the problem of validation of compound documents seems already solved by NVDL

[23:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I can't see that there's anything the CDF WG would have needed to do to address validation, other than to just reference that

[23:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
since it's an ISO standard

[23:37:01.0000] <zcorpan>
indeed

[23:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would think Gregory would already know about NVDL

[23:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but that "since it would require technology that is not yet defined" comment would seem to suggest that he doesn't

[23:40:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
unless I'm misunderstanding what he's describin

[23:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders if ap is still cranking through work on full appcache implementation, and how close his is to completing it

[23:47:00.0000] <ap>
MikeSmith: yes, I plan to fix some more bugs - I think that feature-wise, we only lack dynamic entries now, and those I don't intend to implement yet

[23:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ap: I thought I had seen you posted a code review for dynamic entries recently

[23:49:00.0000] <ap>
MikeSmith: I started the work, and then realized that I didn't like the spec, see https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23165#c6

[23:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks now

[23:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ap: I see

[23:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so, seems like the spec needs to be changed

[23:53:00.0000] <ap>
MikeSmith: the best way to change it may be to drop dynamic entries entirely - we have localStorage and SQL database for that

[23:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ap: I hadn't thought of it that way

[23:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but unless other implementors are specifically asking for dynamic entries, I'd bet that Hixie might be quite glad to drop it

[23:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: there's no clean or distclean

[23:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK

[00:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but maybe there ought to be

[00:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
because I'm definitely seeing different behavior (tests failing) in sources built from my existing workspace vs. built from fresh checkout

[00:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
s/sources built/code built/

[00:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: filed http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=436

[00:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[00:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ↑

[00:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I have no idea why the test behave differently in the two cases

[00:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I did a bit more poking around and couldn't find any clues either

[00:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Yes. I could well have broken that'

[00:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: I literally have no idea what pms.n does. It runs code that you wrote as a frontend to code that gsnedders wrote :)

[00:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: gettters-setters - s/t//

[01:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: BTW my non-scientific tests suggested that the changes I have made to html5lib on the mathML+SVG branch introduce about a 5% performance regression

[01:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
Although that was only based on one run so I guess it isn't too accurate

[01:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: AFAICT you can't get the HTML 4 doctype at the moment. Shall I consider that a feature request? How urgent is it?

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, hmm, too late

[02:03:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, pretty printing ain't working

[02:04:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, euhm... it's not that urgent, because of pretty printing

[02:04:01.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, I suppose I could write a post-processor, but that defeats the purpose

[02:09:00.0000] <annevk>
that's basically the advantages of the W3C private one, a DOCTYPE that works for W3C publications and "pretty" source code

[02:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: I can look at both problems. If it is blocking your work I guess I can even do it today

[02:09:02.0000] <annevk>
I suppose pretty printing I can fix to some extent by having more closing tags, although the serializer in place omits <head> and <body> which doesn't help

[02:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but don't write a post-processor, that makes no sense)

[02:10:01.0000] <annevk>
it's not blocking my work, as I said, I can use the W3C private one

[02:10:02.0000] <annevk>
ok

[02:10:03.0000] <annevk>
it's just that using anolis seems way cooler and it generates better IDs and all

[02:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: OK I will make it a priority to fix over the weekend or something

[02:20:00.0000] <brucel>
yo: editorial question r/e the spec for <small>:  " "legal restrictions, such as copyrights or other disadvantages". I suggest that "caveats" be substitued for "copyright" as a  copyright isn't necessarily a "disadvantge" (unless you're Richard Stallman)

[02:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
brucel, I've just looked at your HTML5 element test page and the layout doesn't work in Firefox 2. Your blog layout is also rather b0rked. Shall I e-mail screenshots to you?

[02:22:00.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, Firefox 2 is known not to work with HTML5 stuff

[02:22:01.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, it has a bug they fixed in 3 :)

[02:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, Bruce's tests are interested in browsers as old as IE6.

[02:25:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, cool

[02:26:00.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, but Firefox 2 does not have 20% market share

[02:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: Are you aware of http://www.gijsk.com/blog/2009/01/zeven-zonderlinge-zaken/

[02:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, yes I declined it via e-mail.

[02:30:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, wow Firefox 2 is the source of only 3.7% of traffic to my own website.

[02:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: Ah, boring ;)

[02:31:01.0000] <annevk>
at my site it's 5% out of 50%

[02:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, all versions of Opera add up to 5.5%, all Firefox add up to 44%, all IE 45%

[02:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I am really not sure why you prefer FF2 to 3

[02:32:02.0000] <annevk>
IE is 23% on mine

[02:32:03.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I tried it for a week and found it really annoying.

[02:33:00.0000] <annevk>
guess that's still too much to remove the IE hacks I have in place

[02:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: That wasn't really an answer to the question :) What did you find annoying?

[02:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me is pretty interested in UI but very bad at designing it

[02:35:02.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, it made me less efficient than I am in Firefox 2.

[02:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, there was so much hype about it's UI being an amazing leap forwards, yet it hardly seemed different at all when I used it. So I felt slightly let down by it, too.

[02:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I've also seen many many reports from people for whom it is crashing a lot.

[02:37:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, Firefox 2 hasn't crashed for me in...erm...actually I can't remember when it last did. (Several months, probably.)

[02:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, oh and I couldn't find a good XP-like theme for Fx3, despite there being a big fanfare about OS Integration for Fx3. Another source of disappointment.

[02:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I can't imagine working without the kind of awesomebar thing in FF3, recent Opera, etc. (I can't comment on stability since I have nightly builds of every browser I run)

[02:39:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, trying to upgrade my parents to Fx3 went badly, too: http://projectcerbera.com/blog/2008/12/fx2

[02:44:00.0000] <roc>
BenMillard: all I can say is, your experiences are not typical

[02:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
roc, I expect that's true. I still love Firefox 2, though. :)

[02:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
People should write software that automatically introduces new bugs at an exponential rate after the next version of the software has been released, to encourage people to upgrade

[02:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, Safari is 3.2% of my website's traffic; nearly as much as Firefox 2. (These percentages are from the 135,072 hits I've had so far this month, as recorded by AWstats 6.7.)

[02:50:00.0000] <svl>
BenMillard: of course there's a Firefox 2 theme for Firefox 3: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6898

[02:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: Firefox 3 on XP looks quite XPish to me

[02:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
svl, Firefox 2's default theme doesn't quite fit XP. The tabs are wrong, for starters. That's why I use Fx2 with Winestripe.

[02:53:00.0000] <svl>
ah, winestripe, not winstripe. (sorry, not that aware of Firefox themes)

[02:53:01.0000] <BenMillard>
svl, thanks for trying though. :)

[02:55:00.0000] <svl>
BenMillard: the most recent comment on the winestripe addons page points to http://webdesigns.ms11.net/winstripethemes.html as having the same for Firefox 3 (even though on that page it's called winstripe again?)

[02:56:00.0000] <svl>
Ah, which points to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9172 which says "this is the Firefox 3 version of Winestripe"

[02:56:01.0000] <svl>
man, what a mess. :)

[02:57:00.0000] <BenMillard>
svl, now that's more like it! "Updated 9 December 2008" explains why I haven't found it before.

[03:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
roc, a comment on that theme says: "Thank you for this theme, i was using one on Firefox 2.x and wouldn't upgrade to 3.0 until i had this theme." :P

[03:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Two people out of a hundred million does not make it a typical case :-p

[03:04:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, I'm not saying it's commonplace, just pointing out it exists. Also, the description says: "Without this theme, I can’t use Firefox 3. And I’m not alone in this case."

[03:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
Okay, so it's at least three people (you, the theme author, and the commenter)

[03:05:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, 1,181 total downloads.

[03:05:01.0000] <svl>
/me wants to bet there'll be at least 100 Firefox themes that people say similar things about.

[03:05:02.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: The problem is that when you change anything there wll always be some people who prefer the old way. The trick is to make more people prefer the new way

[03:05:03.0000] <svl>
Right back to Orbit 3.1

[03:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
(for example people spend a lot of time maintaining SeaMonkey even though Firefox is vastly more popular)

[03:07:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, what I am confused by is why a custom theme does a better job of following the OS look-and-feel on XP than the Fx3 default theme. Especially when "OS Integration" was promoted so heavily as a benefit of Fx3.

[03:08:00.0000] <BenMillard>
svl, the difference here is the theme follows the operating system, which is what should be the case by default (imho). :)

[03:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I doin't have access to XP so I couldn't say

[03:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
The FF3 XP theme doesn't really look non-XPish to me

[03:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me uses all his OSs with the default theme and desktop picture

[03:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me uses Linux so he doesn't expect an entirely consistent look-and-feel anyway

[03:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, jgraham & Philip`: one example is the standard style of the current tab on XP. They have a white background with a yellow bar across the top and black text in the normal weight. Yet Firefox hasn't used that style since Fx1.5 (iirc) and even then it had bold text.

[03:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me uses Gnome on Linux so he does expect a consistent Look & Feel but is sometimes disappointed

[03:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: Do any applications actually use the standard tab style on XP?

[03:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
I assume IE doesn't, and I assume Office doesn't, and I assume Visual Studio doesn't, and I can't think of any other applications I might use that might have tabs

[03:19:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, everything which uses standard controls and avoids breaking XP theming support does.

[03:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
BenMillard: That still doesn't answer the question of whether any applications do that :-p

[03:20:01.0000] <BenMillard>
lol :D

[03:20:02.0000] <BenMillard>
Tools > Options in Windows Media Player 10, IE6 and IE7 does.

[03:21:00.0000] <BenMillard>
control Panel stuff and propety sheets throughout the OS generally do, apart from in really old networking dialogs which break XP theming support so they look Windows 95-ish

[03:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Opera 9.63 does, although the tabs are taller than default and the difference in height between selected tab and normal tab is less than standard

[03:22:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Outlook Express 6 uses standard tabs throughout

[03:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Okay, so maybe there's a few :-)

[03:23:01.0000] <BenMillard>
It's common enough to notice when it's been done wrong, let me put it that way. ;)

[03:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't entirely like how you have to mess around with comctl versioning manifest stuff when compiling Windows applications, in order to opt-in to the new XP themed widget stylings

[03:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though it does make sense in terms of not breaking compatibility with old applications that made unreasonable assumptions)

[03:31:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, was there any conclusion on the spellcheck debate on the WHATWG list?

[03:32:00.0000] <annevk>
/me looks

[03:34:00.0000] <annevk>
seems Maciej had some objections but other than that nothing much

[03:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
fwiw roc's points about spellchecking seemed more convincing to me

[03:48:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, spellcheck seems simple enough

[03:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>

webkit inserts the elements happily

[03:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm

[03:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it seems the viewer doesn't like empty documents

[03:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: could you add a check here in live dom viewer?

[03:57:01.0000] <zcorpan>

http://tinyurl.com/8ujdbn - IE8, log: abbr: [object HTMLPhraseElement]

[04:10:00.0000] <annevk>
why do .constructor? makes it fail in Opera

[04:10:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm, in Opera both <a> and <area> stringify

[04:10:02.0000] <zcorpan>
because <a> stringified to ""

[04:11:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if HTML5 reflects that

[04:11:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ie8 and firefox do that too

[04:11:02.0000] <annevk>
found a bug in HTML5 then

[04:11:03.0000] <annevk>
it only does it for <a>

[04:12:00.0000] <annevk>
you want to report it?

[04:12:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah i can do it

[04:12:02.0000] <annevk>
the IDL bit is called [Stringifies=href]

[04:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: we're having requests from google to be able to use div as default block instead of p in contenteditable

[04:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: could an execCommand be added to control this?

[05:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
brucel and I have been discussing this on skype. Who here thinks brucel's use of <small> for the list items in this blog post is a valid use of <small>, as defined in the spec? http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/redesigning-with-html-5-wai-aria/

[05:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
personally, I think it's questionable and isn't what <small> was intended for. But I could be wrong

[05:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: if he says it's small print, clearly he intends it to represent small print

[05:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
though i probably wouldn't use <small>

[05:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: It looks weird but no one will actually care hich element he uses so it doesn't matter much anyway :)

[05:28:02.0000] <zcorpan>
because it makes the text harder to read

[05:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
the point is brucel was saying how he wanted to be able to use one <small> around the whole <ul>, instead of one in each <li>

[05:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
might make sense - small print is sometimes several paragraphs

[05:30:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I'm leaning toward "valid use"

[05:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notices that someone has 29.9k rep on his StackOverflow character at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/432933/will-html-5-validation-be-worth-the-candle

[05:30:03.0000] <virtuelv>
in spirit what he writes is similar to what you'd expect in legalese

[05:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
although having <a>, <ins> and <del> as such elements is painful enough as it is

[05:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oop. 20.9k

[05:31:02.0000] <virtuelv>
20.9k is still ridiculously high

[05:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>

"HTML5 is not a coherent HTML specification, it's Hixie's sprawling, unreadable and unfinished recipe for every random thing he thinks a web browser should do. It will fail. And W3's alternative approach, XHTML2, has already failed. There is no coherent future direction for web standards. We have dropped the ball." -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/432933/will-html-5-validation-be-worth-the-candle#434044

[05:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
it'd be nice if people who made comments like that were a little more specific about what needs fixing

[05:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: It's hard to be more specific when they are objecting to the concept of something rather than the details. But I would argue that they are quantitatively wrong i.e. HTML5 has already succeeded

[05:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I downvoted that off-the-point rant

[05:49:01.0000] <virtuelv>
that sounded like last week

[05:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ie8 has an [object HTMLNextIdElement]

[05:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"There is no coherent future direction for web standards. We have dropped the ball."

[05:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: indeed mr. last week picked up the stack overflow comment already

[05:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
for somebody to say that "we have dropped the ball", I'd think they'd first need to have been one of the people carrying the ball

[05:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
which dude is not, as far as I can see

[05:53:00.0000] <virtuelv>
On the Internet, anyone can be a dog

[05:53:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(or something)

[05:53:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
he might instead have said, "We should have gotten into the game instead of sitting on our asses and bitching about everything from the Peanut Gallery."

[05:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or wait -- I forget that we had re-set the bar for being in the game to just require that all you need to do is complain about things on your own blog or in comments on other people's blogs

[05:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
corry, forgot about that

[05:55:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
my bad

[05:55:03.0000] <zcorpan>
title: [object HTMLTextElement], hmm

[05:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which reminds me of a joke that shepazu told me: 3 moles are climbing out of a mole-hole during a picnic... top mole says, I smell honey ... middle mole says, I smell maple syrup... bottom mole says, I only smell molasses

[05:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think "We dropped the ball." dude is only smelling molasses

[06:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, that doesn't seem like small-print to me. It's a mixture of background information, licensing, scheduling, disclaimers and an invitation for collaboration.

[06:03:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, the content for most of those items seems quite useful and important but using <small> diminishes that importance (at least visually)

[06:10:00.0000] <BenMillard>
brucel, I agree with you: "Testing it out like this and giving feedback to the HTML 5 lists will also help improve the language."

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm scheduled to give a lecture about HTML5 on Feb 17th for 1.5 hours.

[06:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
any experience of what sort of things should particularly be mentioned and what's of peripheral importance and shouldn't be allocated time?

[06:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
forms

[06:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: should forms be mentioned or omitted?

[06:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
yes, mention forms

[06:44:03.0000] <hsivonen>
by the time my lecture is, the students have already had a lecture about XForms

[06:44:04.0000] <hsivonen>
s/have/will have/

[06:44:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: ok

[06:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's even more reason to talk about HTML5 forms, since they're far more relevant than XForms

[06:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
what course are these students studying?

[06:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
if you know, then try to focus on stuff that will be of relevance to them in some way

[06:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
a course on Web Applications at the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at Helsinki University of Technology

[06:46:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Then probably talk about the various storage APIs, possibly web sockets

[06:46:03.0000] <annevk>
design principles (some); web app features; 

[06:46:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: the lecture topics are at https://noppa.tkk.fi/noppa/kurssi/t-111.5360/luennot

[06:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
feel free to steal content or ideas from my collection of slides

[06:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
lachy.id.au/slides/

[06:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: yeah, I think I'll start with history and design principles

[06:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: thanks

[06:48:02.0000] <annevk>
maybe mention SVG/MathML integration

[06:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, http://lachy.id.au/slides/hands-on-html5/ has a whole bunch of slides on the design principles

[06:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
avoid talking about things like datagrid which aren't seeing a whole lot of interest from browsers yet

[06:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
wow that is some syllabus

[06:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
XForms and XFormsDB as the second lecture

[06:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
what is XFormsDB?

[06:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: How much do you expect the students to already know? e.g. do you need to talk about the use of JS-APIs vs declarative models in XForms?

[06:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: No idea :)

[06:54:00.0000] <annevk>
https://noppa.tkk.fi/noppa/kurssi/t-111.5360/practical_work has info on XFormsDB

[06:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: https://noppa.tkk.fi/noppa/kurssi/t-111.5360/practical_work

[06:54:02.0000] <annevk>
hah

[06:54:03.0000] <jgraham>
:p

[06:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I expect them not to know about JS libs beforehand as part of the curriculum

[07:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: In that case I would spend some time explaining about HTML originally being a Document-centric language but with forms and, in particular, scripting APIs allowing people to extend the capabilities of the language to meet the demand for web based applications rather than just documents

[07:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: The anser to your question on public-html is "Not really" 

[07:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
At laest I think elementtree has a significant ns tax, particularly if you use lxml + xpath 

[07:22:00.0000] <rubys>
since backends are pluggable, how feasible would it be to have ETnoNS and an ETwNS backends?

[07:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: it seems like lxml + xpath sucks for XML processing, then

[07:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: for lecture: explanation about the fact that the spec defines a parsing algorithm, and about it being in general a type of functional spec with a key goal of ensuring interoperability among conforming UAs

[07:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and demos if you have time

[07:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: thanks

[07:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: It is easy to just have a flag that means "don't set namespaces on HTML elements"

[07:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Maybe. But in the non-namespace case it is by far the nicest python tree-from-angle-bracket-markup API. It sucks that I should be forced to choose beteen using the XHTML namespace everywhere for no reason or using a less nice tree API 

[07:35:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, seems like a limitation of Python though

[07:35:01.0000] <annevk>
not really something we should hardwire in HTML5

[07:36:00.0000] <annevk>
/me enjoys the view from his tower

[07:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me arrives

[07:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
(this also affects XPath in web browsers AFAICT)

[07:37:01.0000] <annevk>
nobody has ever defined how that should work so it seems like we could define that in any way we'd like :)

[07:37:02.0000] <annevk>
i.e. make it work the same

[07:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: FWIW I agree that all _browsers_ should be required to do the same thing here. I don't think it should affect other UAs though

[07:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: At the moment, in gecko, XPath in XHTML requires that you implement a NSResolver whilst otherwise you should not

[07:39:01.0000] <annevk>
I know

[07:40:00.0000] <rubys>
fixing it to be the same everywhere is a stronger argument than one that relies on the limitations of a particular Python library (however popular it might be)

[07:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: that can be solved by using Selectors API :-)

[07:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: I don't think that it is just one library though. I think there are lots of cases where tree APIs make life hard with namespaces everywhere. I think the result is that many people will be prepared to break the spec in order to make their user's lives easier

[07:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/with/when you have/

[07:44:00.0000] <rubys>
jgraham: that's better

[07:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: would you still using namespace-aware APIs for SVG and MathML?

[07:44:02.0000] <rubys>
if the spec is wrong, it should be fixed - for everybody

[07:44:03.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: that is, do you envision ignoring the namespace or comparing no-namespaceness?

[07:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: the later

[07:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
*latter

[07:45:02.0000] <rubys>
is there a good selectors API implementation for Python?  If not, that certainly sounds like a worthy project...

[07:45:03.0000] <brucel>
Can I butt in to re-start conversation about <small>?  (have been away setting up family's new computers)

[07:45:04.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: I think there might be something built on top of lxml

[07:45:05.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: it seems to me that XPath sucks for everyone as far as namespaces go. Still, fixing XPath is pretty far out of scope of HTML5

[07:45:06.0000] <gsnedders>
How does libxml2 deal with namespaces?

[07:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: comparing against no-namespacedness is zero win in most APIs

[07:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: it's a win only in XPath

[07:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: we should be designing for Selectors instead of XPath anyway :-)

[07:46:03.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: It is a win in elementree based apis

[07:47:00.0000] <rubys>
hsivonen: I wasn't referring to that spec.  If JGraham wants to say that HTML5 is wrong, he may have a good case.

[07:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
(they use names of the form {nsuri}tagname to represent namespaced elements

[07:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: sounds like elementtree is flawed for its primary purpose (representing XML)

[07:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Only if you are mostly dealing with namespaced xml. I guess most people are not

[07:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
see <http://www.jclark.com/xml/xmlns.htm>

[07:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: who's dealing with XML and not dealing with namespaces these days (and not being a bozo in the process)?

[07:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I guess lots of people parsing simple internal formats like config files. Maybe I am wrong :)

[08:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs to number the title page of his LaTeX document

[08:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
No you don't

[08:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
LaTeX is always right - you can't just disagree with its choices

[08:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip` is wise

[08:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Sadly, I probably ought to follow what the exam board says

[08:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes no marks are actually given for it, but he still probably ought to

[08:36:00.0000] <annevk>
just add a note at the end that LaTeX disagreed

[08:36:01.0000] <annevk>
they might appreciate it

[08:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has already ignored half of what he's meant to do, though, to be fair

[08:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
each page should be numbered, including the title page and the bibliography

[08:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
each page should be single-sided

[08:37:03.0000] <gsnedders>
each page should be typed in single line spacing

[08:37:04.0000] <gsnedders>
the font used should be Times New Roman

[08:37:05.0000] <gsnedders>
the font size should be 12 point

[08:37:06.0000] <gsnedders>
your text should be left-justified

[08:37:07.0000] <gsnedders>
titles of texts - novels, plays, poems, critical or reference works - should be in italics, without quotation marks

[08:37:08.0000] <gsnedders>
quotations, unless only a few words long (when quotation marks should be used), should be preceded and followed by a double line space.

[08:37:09.0000] <gsnedders>
Fun :\

[08:37:10.0000] <hsivonen>
if an exam board and LaTeX disagree, chances are LaTeX is right but complying with the board might still be the smart thing to do

[08:37:11.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Yeah, that's my thinking too.

[08:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The problem is getting LaTeX to do the wrong thing is often hard.

[08:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: you could also complain that they require a non-Free font

[08:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is using a different non-free font anyway :P

[08:38:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Namely, Adobe Garamond Pro

[08:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: you rebel

[08:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Computer Modern is broken for me, for some reason

[08:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
a person who was inclined to split hairs over things like this once asked me for expert advice in determining how it was possible to produce notably different page counts on university deliverable with Times New Roman in two versions of Word and one version of OOo

[08:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
too bad my mad skills weren't good enough and it remains a mystery how line layout was so different in different products

[08:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
course staff should have specs for counting graphemes or something

[08:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
speccing a page count in a certain font is way too imprecise

[08:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
When I've had to do things with word limits, usually I run "detex | wc -w" to count and then subtract an arbitrary integer so that I can report a number which is within the limit

[08:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Also, Computer Modern when I get it working outputs ``…'' for quotes, whereas most sane fonts use “…”

[08:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: A better method is to use an average of detex and untex and then subtract an arbitary integer

[08:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What the hell? The instructions are inconsistent about reference style!

zcorpan: fixed live dom viewer to handle empty documents

hsivonen: if you're giving a talk to developers, i would recommend not talking about theoretical stuff, especially about forms, and just giving demos of <input type=date> and talking about <input type=color>

[11:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: then demo a few other features that work in current browsers

[11:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: and then talk about community and invite them to take part

/me wonders how reputation works on stackoverflow

[12:27:01.0000] <annevk>
/me seems to be stuck on 41, just 1 point below a great number :)

[12:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Not "a […] number". The Number.

[13:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Darn, anne caught up with me in the lastweek poll

[13:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Am I still on zero?

[13:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah

[13:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm still on 2. And one of those votes was mine.

[13:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm obviously not much of a smeghead

[13:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You're probably too productive

[13:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You need to be all talk, like me

[13:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me breaks shelly's blog

[13:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i hate xml

[13:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm amused at rob burns' comments on shelly's blog

[13:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
he claims that rdfa would hurt google

[13:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
when the whole point is that rdf doesn't help anyone on the scale of the web, because of the spam problem

[13:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
it can only work on a local scale as far as i can tell

[13:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The trust tools will save us

[13:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, which one is Shelly's blog?

[13:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, this one http://realtech.burningbird.net/semantic-web/semantic-markup/stop-justifying-rdfa

[13:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that he can use WebKit in his OpenGL game by being really dumb and just rendering everything to a bitmap surface and uploading as a texture on every frame, and it actually works surprisingly well

[13:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
and HTML+CSS+JS seems a better GUI development language than the custom library the game currently uses

[13:42:03.0000] <gsnedders>
If you are giving a name as Surname, First Name where does a Jr. Suffix go?

[13:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It comes after the name in any case

[13:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
k

[13:44:02.0000] <virtuelv>
I thought shelley powers was a "she", no?

[13:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: http://www.google.com/search?q=%22smith+john+jr%22+OR+%22smith+jr+john%22

[13:44:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: which seems to indicate nobody has made up their mind about which way round it goes

[13:45:00.0000] <virtuelv>
she is

[13:45:01.0000] <virtuelv>
bwah, and I misread Hixie completely 

[13:45:02.0000] <virtuelv>
I guess I've gone contextually blind, and missed "rob burns"

[13:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
virtuelv: n00b.

[13:46:01.0000] <virtuelv>
:P

[13:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is it bad I have a Makefile to turn my dissertation from LaTeX to PDF?

[13:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: No

[13:48:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: People who don't think don't qualify for having "made up their mind" ;)

[13:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Good.

[13:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: In my experience it's very common to have a Makefile for that kind of thing

[13:48:04.0000] <gsnedders>
It also replaces [WC] with a rough word-count

[13:48:05.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: though my experience is limited to a group of about three people

[13:48:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Did they per-chance learn about LaTeX from each-other?

[13:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I have a five-line script that just deletes all output and runs the four necessary commands

[13:49:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's completely and utterly bogus that the default still requires several incantations to do one simple thing

[13:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me grumbles as the list of reasons for having to define "xml parser", of all things, in the html5 spec grows

[13:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: They probably started using LaTeX before meeting each other, so they learned by copying random examples from web sites until it looked right

[13:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
(or at least that's what I did)

[13:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: It seems to be what most people do.

[13:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
When it comes to latex, I'm convinced 2 > 5

[13:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:D

[13:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I say we burn Dashiva for saying that.

[13:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me looks for an example

[13:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, actually it has an OMakefile rather than a Makefile

[13:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Issue: wc returns a lot of whitespace too

[13:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
but it's the same idea, and it just does some gnuplot and xfig conversions, and runs bibtex and then runs pdflatex three times

[13:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Solution: grep -Eo [^[:space:]]+

[13:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: By "a lot of whitespace" do you mean "one newline at the end"?

[13:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
     767

[13:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I.e., it has leading whitespcae

[13:54:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*whitespace

[13:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Not when I run it

[13:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
miktex had this wonderful command that would run tex and bibtex and everything else as many times as it needed to

[13:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
echo 'hello world'|wc -w|hexdump -c

[13:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
0000000   2  \n

[13:55:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: 0000000                               2  \n                            

[13:55:05.0000] <gsnedders>
0000009

[13:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: I tend to use Kile now, which does all that stuff automatically too

[13:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Your computer is crazy

[13:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Certainly.

[13:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Anyway, you could do sed 's/ //g' which would be much easier to type than [^[:space:]]+ :-)

[13:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
dude, g, we don't burn people for disagreeing with us

[13:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
we listen to them and see whether they have any good reasons for disagreeing

[13:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
and if they do we adopt them

[13:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
that way they agree with us again

[13:58:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: But I don't have to type it because it is in the makefile, and it only deals with 0020

[13:58:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: s/g/gsnedders/g dangnamit!

[13:58:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blames BenMillard

[13:58:05.0000] <gsnedders>
(Or, alternatively, BenMilliard)

[13:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: But it's Dashiva!

[13:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
"g" is either to type than "g<tab>"

[13:59:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm the shared 5th most smegheaddy person here!

[13:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
easier even

[13:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
either is apparently easier to type than easier

[13:59:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me headdesks

[14:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But "g" isn't highlighted in my IRC client, and I can't highlight every case of the letter g.

[14:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
i know

[14:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's what makes it awesome

[14:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-D

[14:00:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: So you give me a valid reason to ignore you? :P

[14:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh when i want you to pay attention i'll hit the tab key, don't worry :-P

[14:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparently the guy who wrote http://stackoverflow.com/questions/432933/will-html-5-validation-be-worth-the-candle#434044 missed teh part where we take out everything from the spec that browsers don't implement

[14:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What's this with something creating files starting with ._?

[14:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
Apple puts its resource forks in ._ files, iirc

[14:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, OS X on a non-HFS+ FS

[14:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: OCamlMakefile creates temporary directories like ._bcdi, but it seems unlikely to be that

[14:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Also: Anyone know anyway to get Windows to hide POSIX hidden files (i.e., .*)?

[14:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, enable the NTFS hidden flag for those files

[14:07:01.0000] <gsnedders>
On a FAT32 FS?

[14:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
and make sure you do the crazy thing and have hidden files not shown in windows explorer

[14:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
FAT has a Hidden flag that does the same thing

[14:07:04.0000] <Lachy>
FAT32 also has a hidden flag, doesn't it?

[14:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
has had since before you were born, g :-P

[14:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[14:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, why are you using a FAT32 FS on a windows machine?

[14:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Because FAT32 is the only FS that actually works everywhere?

[14:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
"why are you using a windows machine" ftfy (</reddit>)

[14:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Because I don't really want to take my laptop into school all the time, so I'm stuck with the Windows boxes there :P

[14:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok. If you need the disk to be read directly by multiple systems, rather than just having it in the windows machine permanently and access it over network

[14:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: It's a USB memory stick :P

[14:09:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[14:09:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Currently mounted at /Volumes/GSNEDDERS

[14:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders how long it will take for a superior file system to replace FAT32 as the defacto standard on USB drives

/me wwonders how he pissed off mrlastweek

[01:22:00.0000] <annevk>
I think hanging out on this IRC channel is generally enough

[01:22:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I should know that, but I forgot

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"Very few people followed instructions. The instructions were to specify what was wanted and why. Most people left out the second (and more important) part, which makes their feedback much less useful and their comments much less convincing." -- http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/discuss/wasp-feedback-2008

[01:23:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I don't believe there was a direct relation

[01:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/discuss/wasp-feedback-2008 - search for "clear-after" - Opera 9.6 parses it badly and destroys the rest of the page, but it looks like HTML5 actually works there, so that's nice

known :/

[02:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can someone explain to me, how J. Random User tells apart Class 1 and Class 2 SSL certs?

[02:06:00.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: What are the "icu" files? In the /dependencies directory I only have commons-codec-1.3, commons-httpclient-3.1 and commons-logging-1.1.1 and the .zip equivalents. Did you mean delete everything in /dependencies and try again? I tried installing it again and got that same error, might try again tomorrow

[02:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
dependencies/icu4j-4_0.jar and dependencies/icu4j-charsets-4_0.jar

[02:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
deane: ^

[02:09:01.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: nah, they aren't there at all :|

[02:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok, then they didn't download even partially

[02:10:00.0000] <deane>
I'll try again later, perhaps I might get a better connection

[02:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Why would J. ever want to tell apart Class 1 and Class 2 SSL certs?

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: well, if Class 1 can be obtained without human inspection, how do I know a site pretending to be my bank isn't run by a scammer with a Class 1 cert?

[02:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: also, what's the point of having Class 2 if the user can't tell?

[02:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I guess security UI is such a disaster anyway that it hardly makes a difference

[02:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: You look in the address bar and if it says "www.thenameofyourbank.com" then it's not a scammer

[02:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it did bother me a bit when I noticed that my bank site is run by (unknown) according to Firefox

[02:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, it's annoying that I've already encountered two useful sites that had certs from Comodo or their resellers

[02:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
banks should all be required to have EV certs

[02:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Why?

[02:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
cannot be obtained without human inspection

[02:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
who uses EV except Paypal, Vidoop and addons.mozilla.org?

[02:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: In particular, why would that make any harder for scammers, who can just obtain a non-EV cert (or not even bother with one at all)?

[02:25:03.0000] <hsivonen>
in the case of Paypal and Vidoop, I really do appreciate the EV cert

[02:25:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
educate people to not trust non-EV certs at all

[02:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
because we are long ago reached they point where they clearly can't and shouldn't

[02:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Educate people to notice the difference between two shades of rectangle in a weird corner of their browser?

[02:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the EV green bar is pretty much in your face

[02:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
although one has to wonder when someone manages to spoil EV, too

[02:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I thought it was the same as the non-EV yellow bar, except green

[02:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: EV bar also shows a name

[02:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
a real business/organization name

[02:28:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
not just a color

[02:28:03.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[02:28:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: non-EV has no bar, and yellow is *so* last Firefox cycle

[02:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
even Google isn't using EV

[02:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yahoo! isn't, either

[02:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nor Amazon

[02:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me was speaking to someone a while ago who said something along the lines of "I don't trust computers enough to do online banking, because there's all these stories of hackers, but I've heard that if it says something like HPTS in the thing then it's meant to be safe"

[02:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
which I would guess is more educated than average

[02:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
average is closer to somebody getting an e-mail message saying, "Urgent! Your credit-card information may have been stolen. To check, immediately go to the following page and type in your name and credit-card number and expiration date and secret pin code."

[02:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
..and they do it

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk>
wtf, http://isitbaconfriday.com/

[02:39:01.0000] <annevk>
uses HTML5 though :)

[02:39:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, EV is pretty expensive I believe

[02:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: some people have a lot of money on their banks I believe

[02:41:01.0000] <annevk>
/me isn't sure he likes it that "trust" needs to bought

[02:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I don't like having to pay for protection, either

[02:41:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: yeahg, relative to normal certs, they're more expensive

[02:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the reason being the CAs must incur real costs in order to be able to issue them

[02:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
they have to do actual work

[02:42:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, sure :)

[02:42:03.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, six figures or so I heard

[02:42:04.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Then there's the people receiving legitimate emails saying "WARNING: a scam email requesting your password has been circulating. WE WILL NEVER ASK FOR YOUR PASSWORD. For reference, here is the original scam email: "... Please reply with: Username: ******* Password: ********"", and then replying with their username and password filled in

[02:42:05.0000] <hsivonen>
in the military, I had to explain to my superiors why the Finnish army needs to purchase its trustworthiness from abroad if they want it to work and why purchasing it from a CA owned by the state didn't work in practice

[02:42:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
unlike regular certs, where they do zero work and get people to pay for them anyway

[02:42:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: market prices

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wikipedia claims someone sells EV certs for $500

[02:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the CA market is extremely, cut-throatingly competitive

[02:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess {citation needed}

[02:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: hey, I think I responded to one of those

[02:44:01.0000] <annevk>
{citation needed} reminds of someone telling me they made {citation needed} stickers and put placed them over advertizements throughout the city

[02:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, all that EV certs do that normal certs don't is provide an identify component, where the identity has been verified according to rules in a publicly available specification.

[02:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
EV certs cost real money because it costs real money to do real identify verification.

[02:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
there is no standard for identity verification for non-EV certs

[02:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's left up to the individual CAs to follow whatever process they like

[02:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so it of course became a race to the bottom

[02:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Do you expect us to believe that anyone actually follows specifications correctly? :-)

[03:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[03:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't care about bank EV for banking

[03:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I care about it when the bank acts as a Paypal substitute or as an identity broken with redirects from other sites

[03:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>

Some UK online shopping sites ask you for credit card details then redirect to www.securesuite.co.uk which asks you to type in some characters from your bank's PIN number and password, which doesn't seem a good way to train people to only enter their details into the bank's own site

[03:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
EV certs are snake oil

[03:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: does that generalize to certs being snake oil?

[03:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: why does Safari support EV?

[03:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would have been my preference to instead publicize the studies showing that special UI indicators for EV certs do not improve security, and may make it worse

[03:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I am not the decision-making authority on Safari UI features

[03:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
SSL itself at least provides encryption, which protects against man-in-the-middle attacks

[03:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and the lock indicator might be a tiny bit remotely helpful to conscientious users

[03:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: I thought the problem was that unverified SSL only protected against passive eavesdroppers, not against men-in-the-middle

[03:28:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(although the danger warning being lack of an indicator is pretty poor design, and EV certs just pile on top more of the same)

[03:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I find PayPal EV helpful when I'm redirected to PayPal from another site of from email

[03:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but you are probably not at risk of being phished in the first place

[03:29:02.0000] <othermaciej>
thus a feature that protects users of your technical expertise level from phishing is kind of pointless

[03:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
of course, I'm required to remember which sites have EV

[03:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if Firefox would alert me if a site that previously had EV stopped having it

[03:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
really all certs should always have had the level of validation that EV certs have

[03:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the likely phshing attack would be the "same site" with a subtly different or confusing URL that has a non-EV cert

[03:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and Firefox can't know that this site without an EV cert is trying to look like paypal.com, even though it is served from elsewhere

[03:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
good point

[03:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Firefox can know that you've never logged into https://paypal.com.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.example.com before, and tell you to check it more carefully

[03:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that is true, but of course has nothing to do with EV certs either way

[04:11:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if he should start using rel="feed"

[04:15:00.0000] <annevk>
/me replies to rubys, in case anyone else was doing it too

[04:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what rubys's motivations for missing some of the obvious other choices from his list of four were

[04:17:00.0000] <annevk>
well, his arguments around 3 characters are also false

[04:17:01.0000] <annevk>
which is all I tried to point out

[04:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think the fact that ruby incorrectly used <!DOCTYPE HTML "">, that DanC made exactly the same mistake in the telcon yesterday, is evidence that we should discourage people from using the alternative syntax. http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html-wg/20090115#l-676

[04:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
even I have sometimes accidentally omitted the PUBLIC keyword when typing the HTML4 DOCTYPE

[04:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: That is probably a point worth making to the list

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk>
indeed

[04:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm replying to ruby now

[04:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think I'm going chill for at least 30 minutes before I reply

[04:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but using "can live with" criteria with bikesheds is a race to an aesthetic bottom

[04:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
"can be produced by all known tools" sounds like a bad condition, because it's impossible to have a list of all known tools in order to validate the claim, and because I'm sure there are plenty of tools that e.g. always emit the XHTML 1.0 doctype and cannot produce anything else

[04:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Indeed, I've previously made a tool that hard-coded one of the HTML 4.01 Strict doctypes

[04:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems more practical to give a list of specific tools and describe what they can each produce, and to limit that list to a small number of the most common tools that have a sensible intersection of what they can all output

[04:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
...which is actually what the spec currently does, just using a list of about one XSLT tool and perhaps some Java API

[04:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
does anyone know which other known tools besides XSLT have problems outputting <!DOCTYPE html>?

[04:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: Julian cited the TrAX serializer, but that's essentially the XSLT serializer

[04:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
iirc the libxml2 serializer but I may be mistaken

[04:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.xom.nu/apidocs/nu/xom/DocType.html - looks like XOM can't do doctypes with a pub-id and no sys-id

[04:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it couldn't do <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "">

[04:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
("Sets the public ID for the external DTD subset. This can only be set after a system ID has been set, because XML requires that all document type declarations with public IDs have system IDs.")

[04:50:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: but can XOM serialize to text/html anyway?

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk>
that was not a criteria

[04:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it looks like it can: http://www.xom.nu/apidocs/nu/xom/DocType.html#DocType(java.lang.String)

[04:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: surely this whole issue is only about the text/html serialization?

[04:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, oops, I misread what you wrote

[04:53:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, sure, but most XHTML is pretty HTML-compatible

[04:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: BTW can you send some testcases for things that are broken in the html5lib serializer/specgen/whatever to me?

[04:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Seemingly not, so I guess that's not so relevant

[04:55:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, hopefully later

[04:55:01.0000] <annevk>
today

[04:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Judging by the source code, TagSoup's XMLWriter can't output <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "">

[04:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
(nor <!DOCTYPE html>)

[04:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
because it always outputs at least the sys-id

[04:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, is XMLWriter designed for outputting HTML too?

[04:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
Not sure

[04:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, looks like it is

[04:58:03.0000] <Philip`>
because it's got special cases for <script> and <br> and all that stuff

[05:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems it's not even outputting HTML-compatible XML - it just e.g. skips the end tags for <br> entirely, and doesn't write <br /> or anything

[05:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Well if you do, I am much more likely to try and fix the right things :)

[05:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thanks Google for making the code search's source code viewer quite utterly broken in Opera, such that all the text is invisible

[05:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: But if they wanted to support multiple brosers, just think how much effort they'd have to put into hiring the brightest people

[05:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
To be fair, making a web page that displays some text is really quite challenging

[05:19:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe it should be <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "xml-compat">

[05:19:01.0000] <annevk>
than only the XHTML nazis would be affected

[05:19:02.0000] <annevk>
s/than/then/

[05:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/xml/sgml/ for less cool value

[05:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
and s/compat/legacy/

[05:22:02.0000] <annevk>
we're getting somewhere

[05:23:00.0000] <annevk>
:)

[05:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't think anyone will take <!DOCTYPE PUBLIC "sgml-legacy" ""> very seriously even though it is accurate, will presumably work in most tools and encourages <!doctype html>

[05:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
er. s/ / html /

[05:29:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe it should be a URL that explains the issue

[05:30:00.0000] <annevk>
it would please the RDF crowd, it would be long and silly and it clearly tells you at the other end that you should not use it

[05:30:01.0000] <annevk>
unless you have to

[05:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, using a URL as a public identifier would be confusing because people may think it's supposed to be a SYSTEM identifier

[05:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
although we could use <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "http://example.org/dont-use-this-if-you-dont-have-to">

[05:35:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[05:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
then people might expect it to resolve to a DTD :-(

[05:36:01.0000] <annevk>
/me needs to stop wasting his time on this discussion

[05:49:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, Google Reader is not smart enough to realize my two feeds are now one

[05:50:00.0000] <annevk>
it also hasn't updated the URL despite the 301, but it did respect the 301

[05:50:01.0000] <annevk>
silly

[05:50:02.0000] <annevk>
and feed readers are supposed to be simple compared to browsers...

[05:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
What is "Java's SAXTransformer"?

[05:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
I can't seem to find it anywhere

[05:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I found a Google reference: http://www.jfrn.gov.br:83/javadoc/com/caucho/transform/SAXTransformer.html

[05:51:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I don't think Google really respects the permanent aspects of 301 and 410 response codes at all

[05:51:04.0000] <othermaciej>
surprisingly there is no higher ranked JavaDoc site in the results

[05:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, maybe it's like http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/xml/transform/sax/package-summary.html

[05:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
(not actually called SAXTransformer)

[05:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: That seems to be an unrelated class that just happens to have that name

[05:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
awesome

[05:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me brings some paint to the bikeshed

[05:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it has a totally different *qualified* name. Namespaces FTW!

[05:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I still have no idea what it is though

[05:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's sad that I can read http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/xml/transform/sax/package-summary.html and not acquire any clue at all about what it's talking about

[05:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
could the Caucho thing be a pre-TrAX interface for doing what the TrAX SAXTransformer does?

[05:55:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand what Sam means here: "Given that attaining consensus on preference on this issue is apparently not attainable, I am looking for answers in the form of "I could not live with..."" -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0157.html

[05:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's all handlers and sources and factories, and I can't see the bit where it talks about any actual code being actually executed and actually doing anything

[05:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
It seems to mean that statments like "I could not live with..." are based on preference, and so go against what he said about attaining concensus on preference not being possible

[05:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
s/to mean/to me/

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Preference is an ordering, "could (not) live with" is a binary function

[05:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: and agreeing on the highest ordered choice is likely to be harder than finding a non-zero intersection of what everyone could live with

[05:59:00.0000] <annevk>
so my plan of not wasting more time on it obviously fails if everyone starts bombarding the list o_O

[06:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could simply not read the posts :-)

[06:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me attempted to add new facts, which is hopefully a positive step

[06:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
<!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "x-cargo:sgml-compat">

[06:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I was only goaded into responding by Sam's apparent irritation that Ian hasn't immediately jumped on this issue as the most exciting thing to spend his time on

[06:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
I hope no tools check that the sys-id is a valid non-relative URI

[06:03:00.0000] <annevk>
oh <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "tag:w3.org,01-01-2022:/dead-end">

[06:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
for any possible choice of doctype, there is surely at least one serializer out there somewhere that cannot output it

[06:03:02.0000] <takkaria>
/me suspects bikeshed

[06:04:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, the funny thing is that none of those serializers can deal with <source> either...

[06:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
perhaps the most legacy-compatible thing would be to allow any doctype that would trigger standards mode as per the HTML5 algorithm for determining it

[06:04:02.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, but nobody cares

[06:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Sshh! for all our sakes...

[06:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: There must be two serializers each with a different single hard-coded doctype, so there's trivially no doctype that could work in all serializers

[06:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: Didn't Bert Bos already suggest that?

[06:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I don't know - I was blissfully ignorant of this issue until about an hour ago

[06:07:01.0000] <annevk>
note that <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""> would be introducing another difference between HTML and XHTML syntax

[06:07:02.0000] <annevk>
I didn't know, but XML requires at least <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "" "">

[06:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, thanks for the evidence. I now accept that XSLT-compat isn't ideal

[06:08:01.0000] <annevk>
or <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "">

[06:08:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems the call for aesthetic consensus is premature given the apparently incomplete technical information at hand

[06:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it's debating the colour of the bikeshed before having checked whether it's large enough to fit a bike into, and before even knowing whether anyone has any bikes they want to store in it

[06:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, I think this discussion just shows that a concensus based approach is fundamentally flawed. Though I'm glad there have been some technical arguments raised

[06:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: consensus of a large group is not a great way to make aesthetic decisions

[06:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
technical, maybe, since more facts may come to light

[06:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I was tempted to propose "any DOCTYPE that would trigger standards mode" on the list but a sense of guilt stopped me

[06:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
I like hsivonen's proposal <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:sgml-compat">

[06:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Why does it matter if people can't spell "compatibility"? The worst that would happen is they'd have the validator complain and tell them that should use the nice easy-to-type <!doctype html> or in rare cases they might want to copy-and-paste <!doctype html system "about:sgml-compatibility">

[06:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it would be pointless to have to debug a spelling error like that

[06:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't want validator support requests on English spelling

[06:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It wouldn't be pointless, because it would encourage them to use the simpler version and save themselves some effort in the long term

[06:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I still foresee a support and documentation problem for me

[06:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
I also like the idea of giving up on the whole thing and going with just <!DOCTYPE html> :-) http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0163.html

[06:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
are the html5lib meta prescan test cases up-to-date?

[06:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I believe so but I woudn't bet my life on them being right or anything

[06:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: ok

[06:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes as a pointless technicality that while <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "x"> would work for any non-zero-length value of x, it actually won't work in XML::Handler::HTMLWriter if x is "0"

[06:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notes that about:sgml-compat becomes opera:sgml-compat if typed into opera's address bar

[06:24:00.0000] <annevk>
same for any value of sgml-compat

[06:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think in really old version of IE it showed a page containing the text "sgml-compat"

[06:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
*versions

[06:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
(so about: worked like data:text/html,)

[06:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
even though about: redirects to opera:, the advantage of using an about: scheme is that people are more familiar with it than, e.g., the tag: URI scheme, and it's non-retrievable, and so there's no expectation of a DTD

[06:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
What's the practical advantage of using a URI?

[06:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, I suppose it's if someone uses an XML tool that downloads DTDs

[06:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
SGML and XML nazis who point the spec and say that the SYSTEM identifier should be a URI are silenced

[06:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suggest using <!doctype html system "file:///dev/urandom">, just to mess with tools that download DTDs

[06:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
as long as there are no consumers that choke on an unretrievable DTD

[06:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[06:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Unretrievable absolute URIs would be better than unretrievable relative ones so that servers don't get hit with spurious 404ing GETs

[06:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: that was my point

[06:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It just took me some thought to work out that that was your point, since I don't think you actually said it :-)

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: it seems to me that test with data <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset='utf-8"> is wrong

[06:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
as far as I can tell, the single quote should disappear in comparison and the test should resolve to UTF-8

[06:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
fix checked in

[06:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: That seems sensible

[06:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: why not minimized 'required'?

[07:00:00.0000] <annevk>
i like quotes

[07:00:01.0000] <annevk>
that was what the "I know" was for

[07:00:02.0000] <annevk>
well, I sometimes like quotes :)

[07:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, tbroyer's Java code could result in output like <!DOCTYPE html><<!DOCTYPE html>h<!DOCTYPE html>t<!DOCTYPE html>m<!DOCTYPE html>l... which probably isn't quite right

[07:23:00.0000] <beowulf>
hi, autocomplete="off" is not allowed on element form, am i being lazy for asking that it should be?

[07:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
beowulf: http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/commit-watchers-whatwg.org/2008/001739.html

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace - "Error: The stylesheet http://rddl.org/xrd.css was not loaded because its MIME type, "text/plain", is not "text/css"."

[07:27:01.0000] <beowulf>
Philip`: ta

[07:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
Silly browsers, trusting the server to get the right content-type

[07:27:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: blame Hixie

[07:27:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It's all your fault

[07:31:00.0000] <beowulf>
Philip`: so, the reason is because IE doesn't deal with textarea's when the @autocomplete is on the form?

[07:33:00.0000] <annevk>
beowulf, it also doesn't work in any other browser

[07:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
beowulf: No, the reason is that not many people use <form autocomplete> and so it's not worth adding support to the non-IE browsers that presumably don't support it already

[07:34:00.0000] <beowulf>
oh, ok

[07:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
beowulf: (The <textarea> thing is an independent issue, about <textarea autocomplete> not being added since it's not even in IE)

[07:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
or at least that's what I gather from the related emails

[07:35:00.0000] <beowulf>
gotcha

[07:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that pretty much the entire XSLT output section is using the word "should", so implementors aren't very highly constrained by it

[07:37:01.0000] <beowulf>
annevk: are you sure <form autocomplete> doesn't work on any other browser? or were you saying some thing else?

[07:38:00.0000] <annevk>
beowulf, not sure

[07:42:00.0000] <beowulf>
i am pretty sure it works, i use it to ensure an event is fired on a input change

[07:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
writing an output mode for html5 for xslt 1.0 seems like a useful exercise

[07:48:00.0000] <annevk>
"CURIE Syntax 1.0" is CR, fail

[07:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: whose FAIL?

[07:53:00.0000] <annevk>
not sure, but hopefully it doesn't affect me

[07:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
My banking site uses <form autocomplete=off> and both Firefox and IE support it, AFAIK, so it shouldn't have been dropped

[07:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
was there a mail from Hixie explaining why autocomplete on <form> was dropped?

[07:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't think banking sites are a good example of markup

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It was never dropped, since it was never there in the first place

[07:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: They're a good example of being required to deal with bad markup :-)

[08:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: http://www.w3.org/mid/Pine.LNX.4.62.0812240739030.24109⊙hdc

[08:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
"That's very rare. I've removed the XXX in the spec saying we might add this. (IE supports it.)"

[08:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'd better respond to that. It seems that all the major banks in Australia use the autocomplete on <form>

[08:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is dissapointed to find that the population density of Australia is > 1/km^2 so it is harder to claim that Australian's don't represent a significant use case :)

[08:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/'//

[08:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's only > 1/km^2 if you count the dingos too

[08:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[08:11:00.0000] <beowulf>
/me will endeavour to read the archives next time 

[08:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
beowulf: The problem is there's quite a lot of them, and no particularly good search tools

[08:13:00.0000] <beowulf>
though @autocomplete on a form is handy and it stops my users getting around safari not triggering a change event on with autocompleted values

[08:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
wow, Australia's population density is only 2.6/km^2. I knew it was low, but didn't realise it was that low

[08:13:02.0000] <beowulf>
but that's not a problem for here

[08:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
woah, the ANZ bank website is extremely slow. It's the last of the 4 major banking sites in Australia I need to check

[08:18:00.0000] <rubys1>
Wyoming — Population - Density: 5.4/sq MI (2.08/km2)

[08:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Greenland: 0.026/km^2

[08:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
The old marketing trick of calling a frozen wasteland "green" in an attempt to attract settlers has clearly not been extremely successful

[08:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Apparently it was a little (but not much) greener back in those days :)

[08:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Does that mean the people of Iceland wanted to use the opposite marketing trick of driving people away from their rather green countryside?

[08:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: No, Iceland just sounds cooler.

[08:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: If they were choosing the name now instead of back whenever it was, they'd probably call it Tesco

[08:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or: Iceland was going to be followed by Fireland, Desertland, Spaceland and Underwaterland, and they were going to be hired out for computer platform gaming enthusiasts

[09:34:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#attr-textarea-wrap what happens when it has a value that is not valid?

[09:34:01.0000] <annevk>
would that default to "soft" or to neither?

[09:35:00.0000] <annevk>
and what is the difference between "soft" and neither?

[09:42:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys1, before forking, you can always appeal to "WHATWG Members" to get Hixie removed as editor in case he isn't acting properly

[09:42:01.0000] <annevk>
to the*

[09:43:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys1, but I guess you have read that already

[09:47:00.0000] <krijnh>
Did that ever happen?

[09:47:01.0000] <annevk>
I haven't heard anything

[09:48:00.0000] <annevk>
but I've only been a member for half a year or so

[09:48:01.0000] <krijnh>
Yeah

[09:58:00.0000] <rubys>
I don't think Hixie can be replaced.  Nor do I believe I can change Hixie.  I therefore simply want to create an environment where others can also contribute constructively.

[10:04:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, fair enough, since I've nothing better to do I started updating bits of the FAQ

[10:04:01.0000] <annevk>
rubys, the ones that are simple, that is :)

[10:11:00.0000] <rubys>
cool.  And by the way, based on experience with open source, providing the option to fork is a great way to call the bluff of people who complain incessantly.

[10:11:01.0000] <annevk>
I think we have the ability to fork with the current license, no?

[10:11:02.0000] <annevk>
I believe the W3C copy doesn't

[10:12:00.0000] <rubys>
If that becomes an issue, that's what I'll work on next.

[10:17:00.0000] <smedero>
I think the language in the W3C doc license is something like "No right to create modifications or derivatives of W3C documents is granted pursuant to this license."

[10:18:00.0000] <smedero>
if this is still up-to-date: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231

[10:19:00.0000] <rubys>
following the links, the original author holds the copyrights.  That's the same at the ASF, which I'm familiar with.

[10:20:00.0000] <rubys>
The W3C license may (or may not) provide additional rights, but it doesn't take away any rights.

[10:21:00.0000] <rubys>
In any case, I've learned to avoid pursuing hypothetical questions (one of my roles is  Vice President of Legal Affairs at the ASF).  If this becomes an issue, I'll address the specific issue.

[10:22:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure I understand "What’s more important, and largely unaddressed, is the fact that the domain of documents which can be serialized as HTML5 and as XHTML5 do not observe a proper super/subset relationship." as XHTML5 would never use text/html

[10:22:01.0000] <rubys>
There are documents that I can only express in XHTML.  There are documents that I can only express in HTML.

[10:23:00.0000] <annevk>
the point of the question was that from now on you either use HTML or XHTML and that which you use depends on the media type you declare

[10:23:01.0000] <rubys>
in other words, I get to pick something and later find out that there are things I can't do.

[10:24:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, both have limits

[10:24:01.0000] <rubys>
if one was a proper subset of the other, I would be fine with that.  But that is not the case.

[10:25:00.0000] <annevk>
phrasing your objection to XML well-formedness madness as an objection to that question makes it hard for me to address feedback

[10:26:00.0000] <rubys>
let me take a look

[10:26:01.0000] <annevk>
this does not appear to be a problem with the FAQ, but rather with intrinsic properties of HTML and XHTML as things stand today

[10:27:00.0000] <rubys>
why "stand today"?  HTML5 defines some forward thinking things...

[10:27:01.0000] <annevk>
but we can't tackle the XML issue

[10:28:00.0000] <rubys>
then, IMO, (X)HTML5 will not "finally put an end to the XHTML as text/html" debate.

[10:28:01.0000] <rubys>
yes, it would seem that the issues are separable, but I suggest that they are not.

[10:28:02.0000] <annevk>
though, to be honest, some have suggested we can, by defining an "XML Application" spec that basically defines XML5 and says you have to follow XML 1.0 until you hit a well-formedness error and then you follow XML5...

[10:29:00.0000] <rubys>
XML5, as you have started to define it, would put an end to the HTML/XHTML debate.  Of course it would create an XML1/XML5 debate... but that might not be bad.

[10:29:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm, I guess I'll just leave that unchanged because I'm not sure what to say instead

[10:30:00.0000] <rubys>
But first we would need to find someone with the interest, ability, and cycles to pursue XML5.  I doubt that such a person exists.

[10:32:00.0000] <rubys>
done with the wiki page for now?  I want to link to your updates...

[10:32:01.0000] <rubys>
http://realtech.burningbird.net/web/page-markups/why-i-will-never-support-html5

[10:32:02.0000] <annevk>
rubys, I updated the browser vendors thing as well to just say "implementors"

[10:33:00.0000] <rubys>
i'll wait until you are at a stopping point

[10:33:01.0000] <annevk>
rubys, it was meant to say that anyway, but Hixie chose "browser vendors" because he thought that might be easier for people

[10:33:02.0000] <annevk>
i reversed it (put the browser vendor thing in the note rather than the implementor thing) as it apparently "upset" you

[10:34:00.0000] <rubys>
I've had a number of occasions where I have gotten the distinct impression that Ian takes the input of browser vendors over pretty much everybody else.  I am not alone in that opinion.  And I don't think changing the wiki page will affect that impression.

[10:35:00.0000] <annevk>
the people implementing standalone parsers or accessibility tools can also ask for priority and some allocated time

[10:35:01.0000] <annevk>
at least, in my experience

[10:36:00.0000] <annevk>
non-implementor feedback is another matter, agreed

[10:36:01.0000] <rubys>
I was thinking more in terms of producers

[10:37:00.0000] <takkaria>
whatwg is invite-only and w3c has a high barrier to entry?

[10:38:00.0000] <takkaria>
/me is a bit confused at Shelley thinking that

[10:40:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, ok, I suppose that's true

[10:40:01.0000] <annevk>
rubys, done for now

[10:40:02.0000] <annevk>
rubys, with the FAQ

[10:40:03.0000] <rubys>
so s/implementors/user agents/?

[10:40:04.0000] <rubys>
or consumers?

[10:41:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, I guess I can change it to "user agents"

[10:41:01.0000] <annevk>
or do you mean something else?

[10:41:02.0000] <rubys>
that would be great

[10:43:00.0000] <annevk>
done

[10:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: I think all conforming HTML 5 documents have XHTML5 representations

[10:46:00.0000] <rubys>
section 1.6 disagrees with you

[10:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, noscript.

[10:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I think if DOM is conforming it has an XML representation

[10:49:01.0000] <rubys>
Can comments contain "--" in HTML5?

[10:50:00.0000] <annevk>
currently a parse error IIRC

[10:50:01.0000] <annevk>
but they will end up there

[10:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: Non-conforming

[10:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: (But yes, they can)

[10:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(I did deliberately say conforming HTML 5 and the DOM)

[10:51:01.0000] <rubys>
yea, I see that

[10:51:02.0000] <rubys>
8.1.6

[10:51:03.0000] <annevk>
<noscript> cannot be in XHTML currently

[10:51:04.0000] <gsnedders>
And it doesn't get into DOM

[10:52:00.0000] <annevk>
it doesn't?

[10:52:01.0000] <annevk>
<meta charset=utf-8> can't go in XHTML

[10:52:02.0000] <rubys>
that I (personally) would like to see fixed.

[10:52:03.0000] <rubys>
not a high priority

[10:52:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, noscript does

[10:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: Should it have any meaning?

[10:53:01.0000] <annevk>
rubys, as a talisman thing?

[10:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Otherwise we end up having different rules to find character encoding in XML and XHTML

[10:53:03.0000] <rubys>
basically, but the document would be non-conforming if meta-charset does not match the encoding an XML parser would associate with the document.

[10:54:00.0000] <rubys>
(my response was to annevk's question)

[10:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And would it do anything if it was different?

[10:54:02.0000] <rubys>
nope, it would be ignored (which is pretty much what browsers today do with it)

[10:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The only at all possible issue is authors thinking it does something

[10:55:01.0000] <rubys>
it would allow me to sent the exact same bytes on my weblog as text/html as application/xhtml+xml.

[10:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Can't you just use the charset parameter on the Content-Type header and not have meta@charset at all?

[10:56:00.0000] <rubys>
the short answer is yes, but the long answer is that content-type is unreliable.

[10:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How so? When is it ignored except when it looks like a feed?

[10:57:01.0000] <rubys>
by "helpful" caches which are buggy.

[10:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah

[10:58:01.0000] <rubys>
Periodically, I have people complain about my weblog, and it turns out that they are viewing a cached xhtml page served to them as text/html.

[10:59:00.0000] <rubys>
As opera and firefox move towards the parsing that html5 defines (and is implemented by webkit), my pages look reasonably fine when served as text/html (minus, for the moment, the display of svg).

[11:02:00.0000] <rubys>
And I actually have versions of my page that deal with browsers (including IE8) that don't yet support html5's parsing rules.

[11:03:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, in the comment on your own blog the & got eaten

[11:04:00.0000] <rubys>
fixed.  Thanks!

[11:09:00.0000] <webben_>
rubys: "turns out that they are viewing a cached xhtml page" ... cached by what?

[11:10:00.0000] <webben_>
/me is considering creating a bliki serving HTML5 to supporting browsers only, so is interested in the practical problems involved.

[11:10:01.0000] <rubys>
intermediaries between the client and the server.  Could be an ISP.  Could be something your employer provides.

[11:10:02.0000] <webben_>
I see.

[11:13:00.0000] <rubys>
example: http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/10/16/Popping-Pie-Partial#c1224229904

[11:15:00.0000] <webben_>
hmm

[11:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there any way to use <pre> or <textarea> with arbitrary element contents, such that the same bytes will work the same in text/html as in application/xhtml+xml?

[11:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
(what with the leading-newline-stripping behaviour in the text/html parser)

[11:27:00.0000] <BenMillard>
othermaciej, I wrote about allowing other doctypes here (specifically, W3C ones which trigger standards mode): http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007Jun/0318.html

[11:30:00.0000] <rubys>
Phillip`: In general, no.  But a lot of content doesn't pose a problem.

[11:30:01.0000] <rubys>
For example, my code samples don't typically start with a newline.

[11:31:00.0000] <rubys>
It actually is legal to put the text on the same line as the <pre> in html :-)

[12:56:00.0000] <annevk>

[14:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Not to all videos

[14:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think it's user opt-in

[14:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe only to Obama ones, because people were complaining about that a lot

[14:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
so on a totally different front

[14:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
am i the last person to find out that IE doesn't expose window.toolbar and company?

[14:43:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders what .toolbar is

[14:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
opera doesn't have it either it seems

[14:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
though i got the weirdest error trying to find out

[14:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
var x = {}; for (i in window) if (window[i] == "[object BarInfo]") x[i] = 1; x

[14:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
=> Statement on line 1: The Object does not implement [[Call]]

[14:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
there are no method calls in that!

[14:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
wtf

[14:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
window[i].toString for some i, maybe

[14:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess

[14:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
[[Call]] is pretty low-level in the first place. I'd expect 'not a function' or something for a direct misplaced call

[14:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
window.java, window.sun, window.netscape, and window.Packages

[14:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
those are the ones that don't implement [[Call]]

[14:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder whether to bother supporting these properties

[14:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
IE doesn't

[14:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
(the BarProp ones)

[14:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
(or BarInfo in Safari)

[14:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, my opera might just be out of date

[14:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
how does one update to the latest opera build again?

[14:57:01.0000] <annevk>
http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/

[14:58:00.0000] <annevk>
in opera:config#AutoUpdate you can set a setting to make sure it always updates to the latest snapshot

[14:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh good

[14:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
that must be new since the version i have

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>

/me will probably annoy everyone in here this weekend constantly asking for help with maths :P

[15:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes people asking maths questions iff he can easily remember the answer, but otherwise it makes him realise how much he's forgotten

[15:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: How much can you remember complex numbers?

[15:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(Or rather, how to do anything with them?)

[15:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Complex numbers are easy, they're just like normal numbers but there's two of them

[15:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[15:34:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Then hopefully it satisfies the iff

[15:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Alternatively: Complex numbers are easy, they're just geometry - you simply imagine each number being a line, and then the answers are obvious

[15:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't like making imaginary things into real things to plot them on a graph though

[15:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
it makes them seem real.

[15:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
complex numbers are easy, just s/i/sqrt(-1)/ and then it all makes sense

[15:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Surely s/i/sqrt(-1)/g?

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought you didn't like me calling you g :-P

[15:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: :P

/me is currently busy failing to remember how to do the maths for a Breakout game

[15:37:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if sed has an h flag

[15:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: do it on a text terminal, the collision detection algorithm becomes much easier

[15:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually I think the problem is not the maths, it's that I'm modelling the world as if it contains several independently-moving objects with infinite mass, which causes problems when the ball gets stuck between them

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
if they can both move and they can collide, that's gonna give you issues, yes

[15:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
you should do breakout using box2d's engine

[15:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
complete overkill, but you could do some pretty funky things

[15:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
like having the boxes knock each others over or something

[15:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
Using a library would be cheating :-)

[15:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
using a library is sensible :-P

[15:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Being sensible is cheating

[15:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I'm very surprised that your working with complex numbers. I didn't that would be covered in high school. It wasn't for me.

[15:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
You didn't do complex numbers? :-o

[15:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
That might have been covered in the 3 unit maths in years 11 and 12 that I didn't do

[15:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
I saw a video once last year that explained how they work really clearly. I can't remember where though

[15:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
shockingly, complex numbers were not covered for me until advanced maths (the math level beyond the normal A-level maths)

[15:59:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, seems XXX-Origin can be named Origin again


2009-01-17
[16:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparently

[16:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think i'll wait for adam to write the i-d though

[16:00:02.0000] <annevk>
there will be an ID? ok

[16:01:00.0000] <annevk>
guess he can define authoring requirements and such then, neat-o

[16:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i hope so

[16:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
gonna be pretty short, i expect

[16:01:03.0000] <annevk>
the header is already registered fwiw, but I guess doing it separately from both HTML5 and CORS is fine

[16:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's CORS now?

[16:02:00.0000] <annevk>
pretty much

[16:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[16:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
remind me to update xbl next year or so

[16:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[16:02:04.0000] <annevk>
hehe

[16:03:00.0000] <annevk>
hopefully xbl has some implementor traction by then

[16:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
i've heard louder rumblings than usual recently

[16:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
so we'll see

[16:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
i want people to implement type=date and type=color

[16:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
in multiple browsers

[16:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
that would get us a lot of traction i think

[16:04:03.0000] <annevk>
that'd be cool

[16:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
(from the average author)

[16:04:05.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, i'd love to blog about html5 and say why it's a great idea and all, but it'll sound hollow until we have something concrete that authors can use widely

[16:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
I found the videos that taught me about complex numbers http://www.dimensions-math.org/Dim_download2_E.htm (chapters 5 and 6)

[17:32:00.0000] <olliej>
/me is honestly not sure what to make of the latest whatwg mailing

[17:33:00.0000] <olliej>
/me has drafted multiple replies and decided they're all too far at the "what the hell are you talking about" end of the spectrum

[17:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
olliej, which mail are you talking about?

[17:40:01.0000] <olliej>
oh

[17:40:02.0000] <olliej>
web apps wg list

[17:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, do you mean "[Web Workers API] Data synchronization"

[17:41:01.0000] <olliej>
yup

[00:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me collects interesting data for how to handle <a href="javascript:'...'" target=iframe> for various cases like same-origin, cross-origin, same-browsing-context, child browsing context, etc

[01:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: "Advanced maths"? Even in my sister's day (i.e., before yours), it was "further maths".

[02:05:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, afaict most on* attributes start out as undefined in most browsers

[02:19:00.0000] <hendry>
annevk: why did you "dropped the RSS feed in favor of Atom. If someone can increase the acceptance of rel="feed" in user agents that would be much appreciated as it would save me thirty-three characters on several pages. No, I donât have Googleâs bandwidth bill, but readability counts.

[02:19:01.0000] <hendry>
16th January 2009

[02:19:02.0000] <hendry>
annevk: oh crap copy and paste :)

[02:20:00.0000] <hendry>
annevk: was thinking Atom is draconian right? so why use it

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk>
RSS is too

[02:21:01.0000] <annevk>
but no feed reader is so in practice it doesn't matter much

[02:22:00.0000] <hendry>
annevk: i noticed when i had an error in my atom feed, it wouldn't render in firefox

[02:22:01.0000] <hendry>
annevk: though an error in rss rendered

[02:22:02.0000] <hendry>
hence i stopped using atom

[02:22:03.0000] <annevk>
ok

[02:22:04.0000] <annevk>
my RSS feed sucks though, it's not full text

[02:25:00.0000] <annevk>
I mean sucked, it's gone now

[02:25:01.0000] <annevk>
to a nice place Ubuntu calls trash:///

[02:25:02.0000] <hendry>
urgh

[02:25:03.0000] <gsnedders>
hendry: Fx uses the same XML parser for both

[02:26:00.0000] <hendry>
gsnedders: i could be wrong, i didn't really investigate

[02:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
So the same error should cause a fatal XML error in both

[02:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: And SP supports @rel=ffed' :P

[02:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*feed

[02:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
hendry: Couldn't you have just fixed the error in your Atom feed? :-)

[02:33:00.0000] <hendry>
Philip`: i just switched to RSS and things started working. Hence I was thinking why Atom? :)

[02:33:01.0000] <annevk>
for a moment I thought http://hixie.ch/specs/hsf/hsf might of help when it is done, but it uses XHTML, go figure

[02:33:02.0000] <annevk>
might be of help* geez

[02:33:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It's what became hAtom

[02:33:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Last-Modified: Thu, 04 Sep 2003 12:48:48 GMT

[02:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
However, that has even less support in normal feed readers than @rel='feed'.

[02:34:01.0000] <annevk>
no need to tell me things I already know :)

[02:34:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Then why link to that and not hATOM ?:P

[02:34:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*hAtom

[02:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Damned Anne trying to confuse me!

[02:38:00.0000] <annevk>
i'm not at fault, you're trying to apply logic to this situation

[02:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
True.

[06:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: (It always will, because it does more. But the cost is greater than it need be at the moment.)

[08:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suggest calling them "cabalists"

[08:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
An unauthorised calculator is defined as: 

[08:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
♦ a calculator with inadmissible facilities, eg a computer algebra system (CAS) 

[08:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
♦ a calculator which contains inadmissible data or text 

[08:09:03.0000] <gsnedders>
♦ any form of hand-held computer, eg a personal digital assistant (PDA) 

[08:09:04.0000] <gsnedders>
So that's what I need.

[08:09:05.0000] <Philip`>
You need an authorised calculator?

[08:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, just one that isn't unauthorised :P

[08:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[08:10:02.0000] <Philip`>
I typoed

[08:10:03.0000] <Philip`>
I meant:

[08:10:04.0000] <Philip`>
You need an unauthorised calculator?

[08:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, I need one that is authorised :P

[08:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
So when you said "that's what I need", you meant the complete opposite?

[08:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah.

[08:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Obviously.

[08:11:04.0000] <Philip`>
But I can't complain since I said "authorised" when I meant the complete opposite :-(

[08:11:05.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: is diamond #2 something that you are allowed to address by letting a teacher reset your calculator?

[08:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
diamond #2?

[08:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: or do you need one that they can tell is authorized by looking at it

[08:12:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, that sort of diamond.

[08:12:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I dunno.

[08:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: if you need the latter, I suggest pushing as close to the limit as you can by getting a calculator that has an editable input buffer

[08:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I already have such a calculator (just non-graphical).

[08:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone have any opinion on the TI-84?

[08:54:00.0000] <annevk>
yay, more RDF e-mail :)

[08:54:01.0000] <annevk>
/me &heart; RDF e-mail

[08:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You should express that as RDF so that it can be reused 

[09:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Also, I'd be able to add it to my knowledge-base about you.

[09:01:01.0000] <annevk>
two good reasons not to me

[09:01:02.0000] <annevk>
s/ me//

[09:02:00.0000] <annevk>
and a knowledge-base about me, wtf?

[09:02:01.0000] <annevk>
you guys are crazy

[09:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
We stalk you, don't you know?

[09:02:03.0000] <annevk>
aah, that explains why my garbage bin moves at night

[09:02:04.0000] <gsnedders>
It's one of many great uses of RDF!

[09:25:00.0000] <annevk>
more xml:id fallout: http://blog.jclark.com/2009/01/relax-ng-and-xmlid.html

[10:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, Shelley...

[11:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Shelley's mention of RSS 1.0 is interesting, because after flirting with RDF, the feed community knowingly moved away from RDF

[11:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, Mozilla implemented RDF when it was a new and unproven thing and has since moved away from using RDF internally

[11:42:00.0000] <annevk>
per definition all the xmlns="" and xmlns:<foo>="" attributes are different in HTML and XML

[11:42:01.0000] <annevk>
apart from that, everything is equal I think

[11:42:02.0000] <annevk>
as far as RDFa goes

[11:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"SVG and MathML had valid use cases. Therefore RDFa must be added for no real reason."

[11:44:01.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, you know, remarks like that is why I voted three times for you on lastweekinhtml5 :)

[11:45:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh, jgraham is close to BenMillard now

[11:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk: Plan "make anne confess", great success

[11:46:00.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, :p

[11:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm confused with the top, though

[11:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Ben isn't very smeggy at all

[11:48:00.0000] <annevk>
http://zaa.ch/past/2009/1/17/the_future_of_the_web/

[11:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
at least we've moved from the Vast Browser-Wing Conspiracy towards a Google Conspiracy

[11:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: That ruins your mozilla example, though

[11:50:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Since they're obviously being pressured by their sugar daddy Google to avoid RDF

[11:50:02.0000] <annevk>
Plan "make people think it's a Google Conspiracy", great success

[11:51:00.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, yeah, and Google was also involved in Atom! Bastards.

[11:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I thought they they hired Atom people afterwards

[11:52:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Cover operation

[11:52:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, Blogger was one of the first to deploy Atom 0.3

[11:52:03.0000] <annevk>
Blogger was part of Google already, right?

[11:52:04.0000] <hsivonen>
oh

[11:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: yeah

[11:53:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Dashiva, thanks. :)  The poll still puts me at 10x more smeggy than you, though.

[11:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
And I still have no votes.

[11:54:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, plan "mark everything on Public-HTML as read unless includes me in the To or CC line", great success. :)

[11:54:01.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk: Going back to your link

[11:54:02.0000] <Dashiva>
"(...) any realization of a Semantic Web will depend on structured data."

[11:55:00.0000] <svl>
gsnedders: I see four votes for you under "all of the above"

[11:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
svl: Smartass.

[11:55:02.0000] <svl>
^_^

[11:55:03.0000] <Dashiva>
So not only is RDF axiomatically going to happen, the semantic web is too

[11:55:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmmm…

[11:55:05.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, great, guess we don't have to do anything then :)

[11:55:06.0000] <gsnedders>
$x = \frac{16}{b-1}$

[11:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
$x$ and $b$ are natural numbers.

[11:56:01.0000] <annevk>
no math post-5PM

[11:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
There is a sequence, x, x + 8, bx.

[11:56:03.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk: Fix the mathml bug

[11:56:04.0000] <gsnedders>
What possible values of x and b are there?

[11:56:05.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: I have a maths exam on Monday, thus maths will appear after 17:00

[11:56:06.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, what MathML bug?

[11:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The one where we only render the first part in a mfenced

[11:57:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, they can appear after 17:00, but only if it's also after 5:00

[11:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: It is currently after 5:00.

[11:57:03.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, if by we you mean Opera, yeah, we should just do MathML natively

[11:57:04.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, true, I meant the 5:00 that comes after 17:00 though

[11:57:05.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: Multiply by b-1 and factorize?

[11:57:06.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, i.e. tomorrow

[11:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Oh, I didn't realize.

[11:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[11:58:02.0000] <BenMillard>
/me chuckles at time format humour, sadly.

[11:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
x(b-1) = 16…

[11:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders how to factorize that

[12:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blatently sucks at maths

[12:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I suggest finding the factors of 16

[12:02:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Try x = any divisor of 16 (including negative) and see if it works

[12:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
$ factor 16

[12:02:03.0000] <Philip`>
16: 2 2 2 2

[12:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, that's only prime factors, which isn't so useful

[12:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
1, 2, 4, 8

[12:03:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It's not that hard to work them out :P

[12:03:03.0000] <Philip`>
and 16

[12:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
and it should work for all.

[12:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
according to the answers.

[12:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
Since b-1 divides 16, b-1 must be 1 or 2 or 8 or 16 and it's trivial to find x

[12:04:03.0000] <Philip`>
...or 4...

[12:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
did Opera include some RDF APIs at some point? I can't find documentation.

[12:08:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I don't think so

[12:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. interesting

[12:09:00.0000] <annevk>
all we support is the RDF meaning RSS 1.0 ...

[12:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: do you parse it into a graph?

[12:14:00.0000] <annevk>
no

[12:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, for all those (i.e., (x,b) = (1.17)…(16,2)) "calculate the sum of the first 10 terms". So, using $0.5*10(x+(10-1)8)$ I get the wrong answers

[12:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But s/x/2x/ gives the right answers.

[12:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Assuming the given answsers are correct)

[12:25:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*answers

[12:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Why would it be 2x?

[12:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
First ten in what order?

[12:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
First ten of what?

[12:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The arithmetic sequence x, x + 8, bx

[12:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's not a sequence, it's just three numbers

[12:28:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(for which we found possible values of x and b)

[12:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Sorry, that's the first three terms of the sequence

[12:28:04.0000] <gsnedders>
So the sequence should be, I think, x + (n-1)8

[12:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think this qualifies as well-defined

[12:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: That's normal in this textbook.

[12:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:(

[12:29:03.0000] <Dashiva>
You're holding out on us

[12:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yet the only way this works for the final part of the question is 2x + (n-1)8

[12:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Which inevitably breaks what I asked above

[12:30:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Why don't you tell us the whole question :)

[12:30:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Because Im lazy? :)

[12:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
x + (n-1)8 doesn't look like it involves b at all

[12:31:00.0000] <jcranmer>
arithmetic sequences you can solve given only two terms

[12:32:00.0000] <jcranmer>
well, two terms and you know what number those are

[12:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's true but, I think, irrelevant :-p

[12:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, maybe not

[12:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
"The arithmetic sequence x, x + 8, bx" is only an arithmetic sequence if bx = x+16

[12:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
and the earlier condition on b and x means that's true

[12:34:03.0000] <gsnedders>
http://pastebin.ca/1311084

[12:34:04.0000] <gsnedders>
There's the full question.

[12:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
... that's a very different question!

[12:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The bx part is completely irrelevant in the final part.

[12:35:02.0000] <Dashiva>
And Philip` answered it

[12:35:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Where?

[12:35:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is blind

[12:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Guess you're out of luck then :(

[12:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[12:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
The final part it gives answers 370–520.

[12:36:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I got 365–440.

[12:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
The first term in the sequence is x, the tenth term is x+8*9, so the mean is (x+x+8*9)/2 and the sum is 10*(x+x+8*9)/2

[12:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is 5x+36

[12:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
If the sequence were $2x + (n - 1)8$ for the $n$th term, and not $x + (n-1)8$, I would get those answers

[12:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Wait, I can't do arithmetic

[12:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That disagrees with both me and the textbook

[12:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
It's 10x+360

[12:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
so the answers are 370, 520, etc

[12:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It should be $0.5n(x+(n-1)8)$

[12:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh wait.

[12:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
I think you're missing a +x in the middle

[12:40:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I can't read.

[12:40:04.0000] <gsnedders>
It should be 2x

[12:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't read the textbook

[12:42:00.0000] <jcranmer>
/me sighs

[12:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Scary problem: I'm meant to know a large number of equations on Monday

[12:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
You shouldn't know the equations, you should just know how to derive them :-)

[12:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: deriving everything from axioms in a test takes time

[12:43:01.0000] <jcranmer>
hsivonen: that's how I survived AP Physics

[12:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yeah, I do that with the computing things (mainly we are meant to remember algorithms). But in maths, as hsivonen, it takes precious time.

[12:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
(e.g. I don't know the equation for summing arithmetic sequences, but I know it's the average of the first and last terms multiplied by the number of terms)

[12:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: You don't need to start from the axioms and produce a formal proof, so it's not quite that bad :-)

morning

[00:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
morning

[00:32:00.0000] <hallvors>
afternoon. whatever. :)

[00:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyone remember what the url for Lachy's live-dom-viewer-like tool is?

[00:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://html5.lachy.id.au/beta/

[00:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[00:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
what does the MIME type field do in that?

[00:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
nothing yet

[00:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[00:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
it will eventually serve the same purpose as the MIME type field on this page http://html5.lachy.id.au/

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
so we don't have a live dom viewer for xml yet, right?

[00:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
no. I tried to make one, but had difficulty getting it to function properly. I can't remember exactly what the problems were

[00:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i seem to recall the same

[00:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me is confused why document.lastChild.lastChild isn't a text node in http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/xmlns-dom.xhtml

[00:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh

[00:47:01.0000] <zcorpan>
the script runs during parsing

[00:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me is contemplating whether to get up and go skiing for the first time this season, or be lazy and stay home

[00:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
there's no real surprises in this list. It's basically the same stuff people have been asking for, for several years now http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/discuss/wasp-feedback-2008

[00:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
this one is partially addressed by <style scoped> already, but the ability to reset styles wouldn't work too well http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/discuss/wasp-feedback-2008#scoped-style

http://www.webstandards.org/2009/01/16/css-working-group-feeds-back-to-wasp/

[01:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh dear. The trains to the ski slope don't run frequently enough today to be worth going :-( It'll be after midday before I arrive

[01:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-cg/2009JanMar/0018.html are the xhtml2 wg even working on xhtml2 anymore? i haven't seen them mention it in status reports in months

[01:29:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, Member links for the lose. :(

[01:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
BenMillard, it looks like a status report about their specs, except that it omits XHTML2

[01:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe xhtml2 is perfect so no more work needs to be done

[01:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
discussion about html5 in general has gone up lately but the forums are dead

[01:35:01.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder why

[01:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, cheers. Do they currently have a charter? I could only find this: http://www.w3.org/2007/03/XHTML2-WG-charter

[01:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
(linked to in the first paragraph of their homepage: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/)

[01:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
that is their current charter

[01:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, oh I misread 2009 as 2008. :P

[01:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
2.3 Milestones seems out of date. "XHTML 2.0" to become "REC" in "Sep 2008"?

[01:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL

[01:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder where they intend to find implementations?

[01:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: much of xhtml2 already works in browsers so maybe that's enough to label it as a rec

[02:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: do the implementations need to be browsers? can they be a schema that validates XHTML2 and an XSLT transform that produces XHTML2?

[02:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I would hope there would be some implementations designed for end users as well, not just developer tools

[02:49:00.0000] <deane>
I can not understand how they were allowed to switch from the xhtml2 namespace to the same namespace (xhtml) that we are using, we were using it first. When html5 came to the W3C it was using the xhtml namespace, and xhtml2 had it's own namespace, I can't see how they can just change to the same one as us like that.

[02:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought XHTML2 had switched to the xhtml namespace (in (unpublished?) drafts) before HTML5 was in the W3C

[02:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
deane: the same way they can write a de facto text/html-targeted spec that relies on stuff like xmlns:dc

[03:00:00.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: And the same way that they can publish a document about what mime types are ligit for xhtml even though they are not the only ones working on xhtml specs and this bogus document contradicts the HTML5 spec. Then when someone complains about it, they just go ahead and publish the document anyway.

[03:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
deane: if you have the cycles, you could file Formal Objections, I suppose

[03:14:00.0000] <deane>
hsivonen: "...stuff like xmlns:dc" yeah, but instead of acknowledging that these people aren't writting specs for the real web, it appears that Shelley and others think it is simply the html5 communitie's fault for not having the forsight/insight/intelligence to put distributed extensibility into text/html

[03:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
deane, where/when did the XHTML2 WG announce that they have actually changed the namespace? The current draft, published in 2006, still uses the other ns

[03:17:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Lachy, I noticed it in a diff-marked Wikipedia page hsivonen linked this channel to a while back...not sure of official documents, though.

[03:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
the last I heard about the NS issue was that they were intending to do so, but that was well before we had all the discussion about it on public-html

[03:19:00.0000] <Philip`>

[03:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/1649

[03:21:00.0000] <deane>
Lachy, http://www.w3.org/2007/10/03-xhtml-minutes.html

[03:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, re the RDFa namespace and DOM discussion, that seems to be roughly the same issues that aria encountered when they wanted to add in namespace prefixed attributes and values

[03:26:01.0000] <deane>
Lachy: Shane's latest "Editor's Draft"  http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2009/ED-xhtml2-20090109/ the "public draft" hasn't been updated since 2006

[03:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wish there were a latest editors draft link for XHTML2, instead of just dated links

[03:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
where does the xhtml2 group post the links to the editors drafts?

[03:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wonders what happened with this week in html5

[03:35:00.0000] <deane>
Lachy: in the "XHTML Document Development Area"  http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Drafts/

[03:39:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, I had worries along those lines about Geocities in 1998 and freewebs in 2000. Those are what eventually compelled me to buy hosting from someone whose home phone number I have and who sends me an Xmas card each year. :)

[03:40:00.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, it's also one reason my has no comments system; the responsibility of looking after other people's content is daunting.

[03:40:01.0000] <BenMillard>
s/my has/my website has/

[03:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's why I keep a copy of all my data locally and have a weekly backup of my blog database emailed to me

[03:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
although there was one occasion that I lost a number of irreplacable files

[03:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
not too many though

[04:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
My hands are cold :(

[08:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Incrementally parsing XML doesn't seem a particularly weird thing, since that's kind of what SAX is for

[08:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
and it's kind of obvious how it should work even if nobody has written a proper detailed spec

[08:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and the problem is just that implementors don't understand XML and introduce bugs by e.g. failing to use a proper namespace-aware serialiser)

[08:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, this comment from Travis is a relief http://annevankesteren.nl/2009/01/gettters-setters#comment-6694

[08:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
but there's still no mention of __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__ in IE, which could be a problem

[08:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: maybe they still aren't used enough in the wild that one could get away with not supporting them

[08:54:00.0000] <myakura>
/me heard that javascript:alert(document.body.__defineGetter__); returns undefined in the pre-RC build (and it was [native code] in beta2)

[08:54:01.0000] <zcorpan>
myakura: seems about right

[08:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
myakura, it's returning undefined for me in RC1

[08:58:01.0000] <myakura>
:(

[09:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
it really sucks that the ECMA spec is in PDF instead of HTML :-(

[09:07:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, no kidding

[09:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
it sucks even more that they've produced the PDF with revision tracking turned on, making it harder to read

[09:10:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: the logo seems hard to redo in svg - it just becomes smudgy

[09:11:00.0000] <annevk>
it's not really vectorlike

[09:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
Combine a vector outline with a bitmap texture?

[09:11:02.0000] <annevk>
unless you use a filter or something I suppose

[09:12:00.0000] <annevk>
what Philip` said

[09:13:00.0000] <annevk>
hehe, "SVG SUCKS", so true

[09:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: you could use the webfont for the "WEBLOG 4.2" part

[09:19:00.0000] <annevk>
would that be an improvement?

[09:19:01.0000] <annevk>
i guess it would

[09:21:00.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if the SVG can be further simplified

[09:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Shouldn't it be at least WEBLOG 4.3 by now?

[09:22:00.0000] <annevk>
it's not an actual version number

[09:31:00.0000] <jcranmer>
o_O

[09:32:00.0000] <jcranmer>
what is so hard about creating viable use cases for RDFa?

[09:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: It's designed to satisfy a large number of classes of use cases, and if you only focus on a dozen individual cases then you'll probably come up with a dozen solutions that are simpler than RDFa for those use cases but that are useless for the million other use cases

[09:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Shouldn't it be WEBLOG 5?

[09:37:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: even so, everyone always acts as if there's no reason why RDFa shouldn't just be included

[09:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
so the concept of analysing use cases is fundamentally flawed, as it can't come up with globally optimal solutions that have the best overall cost-per-use-case

[09:43:00.0000] <takkaria>
RDFa is a globally optimal solution? :)

[09:44:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, not a version number

[09:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: But 5 > *.

[09:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: It may or may not be, but we won't be able to determine that if we only look at individual use cases :-)

[09:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: http://simon.html5.org/dump/logo.svg

[09:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it looks worse, double the size, but at least it's scalable

[10:01:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, the non-SVG version is still nicer

[10:01:01.0000] <annevk>
thanks though :)

[10:01:02.0000] <zcorpan>
welcome :)

[10:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i could make it as nice, but then the file size would be ridiculuos

[10:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(like 50kb)

[10:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but daddy.svg is good enough, no?

[10:06:00.0000] <rubys>
how was the AvK svg produced?

[10:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: livetrace in illustrator

[10:07:01.0000] <rubys>
I'm impressed... most tools like that produce 8 digits of (quite unnecessary) precision and a lot of style crap.

[10:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: i did save for web & devices, set digits to 1 and cleaned it up afterwards

[10:09:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I'd say 2, maybe 3, digist is all you need

[10:09:01.0000] <zcorpan>
also i traced twice, once with high threshold (the 0.5 opacity group) and once with low threshold (foreground)

[10:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe it could be tweaked to look better

[10:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder why they emit digits at all - if most coordinates have digits you're wasting the file size with dots

[10:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
instead you could bump up viewBox and work with integers

[10:13:00.0000] <rubys>
I try to do mine all in integers -- and with a viewBox of about 100x100

[10:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
If you care about filesize then you'll gzip it, and the decimal points add very little extra entropy so they shouldn't take much space

[10:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: it's still an optimization that could be made

[10:14:01.0000] <rubys>
in this svg, consecutive paths could be collapsed, and the translations factored in.

[10:14:02.0000] <annevk>
as long as there are enough dots :)

[10:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and it allows for more fine-tuned setting of the accuracy (instead of 1..7 digits you can have say 10..10000000 wide viewBox)

[10:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: feel free to modify it :)

[10:18:00.0000] <rubys>
another example of unnecessary precision: c-1,0-0.8,1.2-1,2 ... unless you zoom in *really* strong, that's a straight line:  l-1,2

[10:19:00.0000] <rubys>
I have some scripts that can optimize individual paths.  Annevk: is this something you intend on using?

[10:21:00.0000] <annevk>
I plan on using http://simon.html5.org/dump/daddy.svg at least

[10:21:01.0000] <annevk>
I would like to use the other as well though currently it looks a lot worse imo than what I have now

[10:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: would you use it if it looked better but was maybe 20kb?

[10:23:00.0000] <rubys>
I like that one! (daddy.svg).  Especially how the text is, well, text.  So you can easily rotate in different slogans...

[10:30:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, and the font Arthur used is free, so we can make it identical

[10:30:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I suppose

[10:32:00.0000] <annevk>
my weblog uses less bandwidth than html5.org

[10:32:01.0000] <annevk>
and 3 times as much as philip.html5.org

[10:35:00.0000] <rubys>
looks like I can cut daddy.svg in half, and that's without combining the paths

[10:38:00.0000] <annevk>
wow

[10:40:00.0000] <annevk>
html5.org now uses 9.37 GB of disk space for diff caches

[10:40:01.0000] <annevk>
that's 3 GB more than a month ago

[10:42:00.0000] <rubys>
early results: http://intertwingly.net/tmp/daddy.svg; clearly the text is misplaced and the bottom half is a single path that was mangled by my script.  But this should be an indication of some of the savings that can be made.

[10:42:01.0000] <rubys>
And I can do more - given the mangling, I turned off a portion of my script that optimizes.

[10:46:00.0000] <rubys>
original image is 14KB :-)

[10:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/dump/logo2.svg might be slightly better (and to my surprise no larger)

[10:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jcranmer: the usual demo use cases of RDFa take a microformat use case and make the solution more complex

[11:10:00.0000] <annevk>
except that they hide the namespace declarations from the audience so it looks more acceptable

[11:11:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, I know xmlns="" can't be put in a namespace due to authors using [xmlns] as a style hook, dunno about xmlns:<str>=""

[11:11:01.0000] <rubys>
seems less likely

[11:14:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[11:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, what benefit would it be to have xmlns:foo put into the DOM in the same way it is in XML, without having to introduce full namespace syntax for elements and attributes?

[11:14:02.0000] <annevk>
though I suspect script libraries (might even be RDFa script libraries!) could get broken if we change things

[11:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how does GRDDL deal with CURIEs given the relative purity of the XPath data model compared to the DOM?

[11:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. given <html xmlns:foo="...">...<foo:bar></foo:bar>... How would you expect the <foo:bar> element to be parsed?

[11:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
given that we already went through this whole namespace prefix discussion with aria: attributes and the conclusion of that was to go with aria-attr syntax, I don't think we should bother going into it again with xmlns:foo and other prefixed stuff

[11:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I don't like it that we have to spend cycles researching if it would break the Web instead of the XHTML2 WG sticking to stuff that doesn't break for sure.

[11:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
agreed

[11:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
danbri: you said you were cc'ing timbl, but you don't appear to have

[11:29:00.0000] <annevk>
http://fuckyoupenguin.blogspot.com/ lol

[11:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
haha! :-D

[11:34:00.0000] <rubys>
hsivonen: yet you have no problem asking danbri to spend cycles doing something that (given your snarky comment above) aren't likely to support

[11:37:00.0000] <rubys>
I'm also not clear what the importance of localName is... localName is undefined in IE.  My experience is that things that aren't supported in IE tend to have a significant reduced chance of being widely adopted.

[11:38:00.0000] <rubys>
If I were in DanBri's shoes, I would be inclined to think that this is all one big snipe hunt.

[11:40:00.0000] <rubys>
The net affect of all this: asking of others what you are unwilling to do yourself increases the perception that this effort isn't truly open.

[11:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: as far as I can tell, there has been no dialog between the WHATWG and the RDFa TF--only indication that they are going to REC and we need to deal

[11:41:01.0000] <danbri>
gsnedders, yeah i forgot the cc:, I fwd'd it to him straight afterwards, cc:'ing Henri

[11:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
danbri: Just making sure you hadn't forgotten and not noticed :)

thanks :)

[11:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: I'm much more OK with expending effort towards working around SVG legacy things than adjusting parsing to fit new things that were designed with full knowledge of text/html and ignored DOM realities

[11:42:03.0000] <danbri>
rubys, i prefer to take an optimistic view of apparent conflict, until i get real evidence otherwise

[11:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: I might even be proactive with validating an RDF serialization like I was with ARIA if I can see that supporting the serialization won't be really bad in a context of XML parser & HTML parser connected to a RELAX NG validator

[11:45:00.0000] <rubys>
hsivonen: would changing the HTML parser to deal with attributes that start with "xmlns:" address your requirement?

[11:45:01.0000] <danbri>
is validator.w3.org relax-ng powered nowadays?

[11:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
danbri: the HTML5 part is

[11:45:03.0000] <danbri>
cool

[11:45:04.0000] <danbri>
/me likes what little he knows of relaxng

[11:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: mapping those attributes to SAX startPrefixMapping calls would give above-parser consistency, but the idea of adding that parser code for an unproven technology that could easily have avoided this problem offends me

[11:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: that is, I think it would set an awfully bad precedent to let other WGs throw HTML-hostile RECs at us and just keep adjusting HTML5

[11:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the experience with the current code for dealing with xml:lang and xmlns:* still irks me so much that I'm not feeling at all charitable about the prospect of doing even more contortions for CURIEs

[11:50:01.0000] <rubys>
I'm sure that there is an equally valid perspective where people can see the HTML and WHATWG as being the ones doing the throwing... is there anyway to get past the "everything is one big pissing context" perspective?

zcorpan: You have to be kidding…

[12:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: sorry i don't follow

[12:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: What is the point of having that as SVG when it is nothing but paths? Surely it won't scale well.

[12:11:01.0000] <zcorpan>
what's wrong with paths?

[12:12:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, that last one is nice

[12:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Surely they won't scale so well as you won't have curved edges properly scaling (and eventually scaling to the point of seeing the straight lines that make up the curve)

[12:12:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: :)

[12:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: paths don't have to be straight (and they aren't)

[12:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>

[12:14:01.0000] <zcorpan>
it's 25kb, but maybe rubys can make it smaller and then gzipped it should be acceptably small :)

[12:16:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, definitely compared to the several MB home pages you see now and then

[12:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i had to resize the raster image to 800% or so and then patch some lines here and there so it wouldn't be so boxy

[12:18:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and then livetrace worked a lot better

[12:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
also if i checked the 'use strokes' checkbox and tweaked the parameters so that it actually wouldn't output any strokes, the number of paths were radically reduced (but looked about the same)

[12:21:00.0000] <rubys>
which is 25kb?

[12:21:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/dump/logo3.svg

[12:23:00.0000] <rubys>
Looks like I can get that under 10kB.... before compression.

[12:23:01.0000] <zcorpan>
cool :)

[12:24:00.0000] <rubys>
I need to debug why the output of my tool is incorrect first. :-)

[12:24:01.0000] <rubys>
But I trust that the size is is in the right ballpark.

[12:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
looks similar enough at 100% zoom :)

[12:45:00.0000] <rubys>
and yet, a bit more bandwidth friendly.

[12:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it might have been a bit too agressive if one cares about nice looks when zoomed in a bit (or when printed)

[12:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>

[14:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/dump/daddy.svg now has the proper font

[14:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, is it intentional that "SVG SUCKS" doesn't fit within the speech bubble?

[14:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: it does if the linked font is used

[14:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
I tried 9.6. I'll get the latest internal build and see if that works

[14:03:01.0000] <roc>
works in Firefox trunk!

[14:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
works in opera 10 too

[14:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and WebKit

[14:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
interop!

[14:04:03.0000] <Lachy>
will it work in Firefox 3.1?

[14:04:04.0000] <roc>
yeah

[14:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. When is 3.1 expected to be released?

[14:05:01.0000] <annevk>
guess I have the wrong Opera 10

[14:05:02.0000] <zcorpan>
webkit seems to wait with rendering the text until the font is loaded, which is seems nice

s/seems //

[14:06:04.0000] <roc>
sometimes you want to wait to show the text, sometimes you don't

[14:06:05.0000] <annevk>
works for my menu though, hmm

[14:06:06.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, Opera had a flash of fallback font

[14:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
firefox too

[14:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
which looked like Helvetica, or other similar sans-serif font. Could you pick a better fallback font?

[14:07:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: which one?

[14:07:03.0000] <annevk>
guess my Firefox 3.2a1pre is somehow out of date then as @font-face does not work

[14:07:04.0000] <Lachy>
/me checks Font Book

[14:08:00.0000] <annevk>
/me doesn't care about fallback

[14:08:01.0000] <annevk>
/me rather has browsers fix their bugs

[14:08:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: will you file a bug?

[14:08:03.0000] <roc>
annevk: you on Linux?

[14:08:04.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[14:09:00.0000] <annevk>
and I might file a bug ;)

[14:09:01.0000] <roc>
ok, that build might not have it

[14:09:02.0000] <annevk>
k

[14:10:00.0000] <roc>
a later build should work

[14:10:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me looks at "The heavier “Impact” sans serif stack" at http://www.sitepoint.com/article/eight-definitive-font-stacks/2/

[14:10:02.0000] <annevk>
guess I'll update then

[14:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, is the font your using under a free licence?

[14:12:00.0000] <annevk>
it's a free font, haven't checked license details

[14:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me finds http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2379 - says freeware

[14:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, IE8 doesn't do SVG :-(

[14:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
conditional freeware with redistribution prohibited

[14:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, the licence isn't particularly good, though it's not clear whether using it as a web font is considered to be a redistribution

[14:19:00.0000] <annevk>
/me doesn't care

[14:20:00.0000] <annevk>
it's not like I abide the law when it comes digital rights anyway

[14:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I know. most people don't

[14:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: provided some fallback fonts

[14:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
also used text-anchor="middle" so it won't misalign

[14:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
nils-dagsson-moskopp⊙dn says "(No, please don't point out that I'm using Wordpress as well and vulnerable to similar things.)", so I'll be careful not to point out anything like http://blog.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/?s=%ef%bf%bf

"markbirbeck: we could produce a document that describes the rendering behavior of the various html document types (?)"

[14:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"Steven: The HTML 5 approach to events is not scalable to the future, for example."

[14:53:00.0000] <annevk>
scaled pretty well for ten years

[14:54:00.0000] <annevk>
assuming he refers to onX

[14:55:00.0000] <annevk>
the namespace crowd always makes assumptions about growth that are never really backed by any research, afaict

[14:55:01.0000] <annevk>
just assumptions

[14:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: London Gazette sure had NS growth :-)

[15:01:00.0000] <tantek>
ironically it is not lack of namespaces that doesn't scale, but rather the *use* of namespaces themselves as evidenced by how quickly documents get messy (hard to read and view source / copy-paste) with added namespaces.

[15:01:01.0000] <tantek>
theoretically, namespaces scale. in practice, they don't.

[15:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm sure there are technical solutions to namespaces that could scale

[15:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
java's for example works reasonably well

[15:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
as i understand it

[15:05:00.0000] <roc>
that works because of the "import" statements at the top of the file which mean you never have to type them in the body

[15:06:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, the other thing I find funny about that site is that they wrote a custom DTD to pass validation

[15:06:01.0000] <roc>
also, Java IDEs have an "organize imports" command which basically auto-generates the correct list of import statements for you and sticks it in your source files

[15:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
also, Eclipse autogenerates them and maintains them, so you never have to type them anywhere

[15:07:00.0000] <jcranmer>
even with packages, I think name collisions are relatively rare

[15:07:01.0000] <jcranmer>
with the exception of some classes like "Pair" (how many people do you think reinvent this wheel?)

[15:07:02.0000] <annevk>
from the design doc of that site: "A <base> element needed to be added giving the identifier URL for the notice; this acts as the initial object during RDFa parsing. Relative URLs in the rest of the page needed to be updated to account for the change in base URL." sounds scary

[15:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: yeah it's quite possible that java's mechanism isn't appropriate for html

[15:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
my point is just that while certainly the existing mechanisms for namespaces in web content have proved suboptimal, that doesn't mean that there isn't a better solution.

[15:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
now i don't know what it is

[15:08:03.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, also, namespaces for code and namespaces for data behave very very differently in practice, in usage, in maintenance etc.

[15:08:04.0000] <annevk>
"(In RDFa, the href attribute can hold a CURIE or a URL; we used CURIEs when referring to terms in known vocabularies, and URLs for more general purpose URLs because they are recognisable to non-RDFa processors.)"

[15:08:05.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[15:08:06.0000] <Hixie>
(to tantek)

[15:09:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I suppose importing would be horrendous if you had a high collision rate

[15:09:01.0000] <tantek>
/me is always referring to namespaces for data when he criticizes namespaces in general.

[15:09:02.0000] <roc>
some languages deal with collisions fairly well by writing something like "import A from B as C"

[15:10:00.0000] <roc>
Java doesn't

[15:10:01.0000] <tantek>
Perhaps I need to say data:namespaces vs. code:namespaces ;)

[15:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me probably ought to learn Java

[15:10:03.0000] <jcranmer>
the only collision I've ever had to deal with is java.util.List and java.awt.List

[15:11:00.0000] <jcranmer>
import java.awt.* and import java.util.* and List don't mix :-)

[15:11:01.0000] <roc>
one important difference is that Java has a compilation step that processes source text in a known environment and emits code with fully qualified names

[15:11:02.0000] <jcranmer>
yep

[15:11:03.0000] <annevk>
(from http://assets.expectnation.com/15/event/3/SemWebbing%20the%20London%20Gazette%20Paper%201.pdf )

[15:11:04.0000] <jcranmer>
/me heads to supper

[15:11:05.0000] <roc>
so the data that gets exchanged is all fully qualified names

[15:12:00.0000] <roc>
HTML doesn't have this step; data transmitted exactly as authored

[15:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
"We don't actually use DOM level 2 in XHTML 1.x at this time.  However, 

[15:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
there is good text in there so I have referenced that as well.

[15:12:03.0000] <hsivonen>
"

[15:12:04.0000] <hsivonen>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xhtml2/2009Jan/0041.html

[15:12:05.0000] <roc>
that's a key strength and weakness of HTML IMHO

[15:12:06.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Java is a boring language, so unless you're being forced to write code in Java it'd probably be more fun to learn something else :-)

[15:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I'm gonna be forced to learn it an uni, so I may as well get a slight clue

[15:13:01.0000] <jcranmer>
most interpreted languages will be compiled as the first step of being interpreted (although at a very high level, generally)

[15:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: If you learn it in advance, then it'll just be more boring when you're taught it again because you'll already know everything

[15:13:03.0000] <annevk>
for some reason data and code gets confused more often, e.g. people saying XML works because C compilers work

[15:13:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That is true.

[15:14:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I prefer Java over C++

[15:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: In terms of a productive language to write things in, or in terms of being fun to use?

[15:14:02.0000] <jcranmer>
probably productivity, but I'm a practical guy

[15:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: do you find C++ fun?

[15:15:01.0000] <roc>
I find getting things done fun

[15:15:02.0000] <jcranmer>
most "fun" languages tend to just be annoying to me

[15:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me ought to re-write Anolis in a language that tends to be quicker than Python

[15:16:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, it's quick enough, it just needs a nice serializer and new features :)

[15:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: It's not that quick on the spec.

[15:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: And the serializer is html5lib's fault :P

[15:17:02.0000] <annevk>
there are many specs that are not insanely huge

[15:17:03.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Sometimes, when it lets you write a nice elegant efficient clever easy-to-read interface or implementation; whereas in Java you just write a load of classes and methods, which is really dull

[15:18:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, well, html5lib has a serializer that is good for html5lib, but you need a spectree serializer, that's special

[15:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Why does it need to be different?

[15:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Of course the Java code is likely to be much more maintainable, but that's not the point)

[15:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: and 40s for html5 is too slow :P

[15:21:00.0000] <annevk>
i suppose you could give html5lib a prettyprint serializer fla

[15:21:01.0000] <annevk>
g

[15:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
1.7s to do string substitutions, 1.2s to add cross-references

[15:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Too slow.

[15:31:00.0000] <annevk>
/me notes that Origin is currently named XXX-Origin

[15:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me assumes XXX-Origin is meant to be used to identify adult content

[15:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: for completeness :) http://simon.html5.org/dump/find.svg

[15:46:00.0000] <annevk>
the "Adding Semantics" section of that gazette doc is interesting

[15:46:01.0000] <annevk>
points out a lot of (known) issues

[18:45:00.0000] <heycam>
which is correct en-US: "acknowledgment" or "acknowledgement"?

[18:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
both

[18:50:01.0000] <heycam>
:/

[18:51:00.0000] <heycam>
well, the one with the "e" has more hits on google, so i'll go with that

[18:51:01.0000] <heycam>
using google hit counts is the ultimate descriptivist approach to language =)

[18:59:00.0000] <roc>
I can't wait for Dictionary5 which abandons normative spelling rules in favour of documenting existing usage so other language users don't have to reverse engineer it

[19:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
we have normative spelling rules?

[19:00:01.0000] <heycam>
imagine that, a defined way to parse ambiguous sentences

[19:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
the only normative spec i know of for english is ian.hixie.ch/bible/english

[19:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: I'm sure your English teacher had one, just not written down :)

[19:01:01.0000] <roc>
if we don't have normative spelling rules, then my school teachers lied to me!

[19:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: many do :-)

[19:11:00.0000] <hallvors>
Hixie: you've probably written some tests for script execution/scheduling, right?

Hixie: I've written some 60+ tests, need to push a couple of buttons to get them out ..

[20:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[20:34:01.0000] <hallvors>
they are not very well tested against other browsers and some may of course assert things that will be wrong according to the spec 

[20:35:00.0000] <hallvors>
but I plan to get feedback from other vendors and you when they are out

[20:37:00.0000] <hallvors>
hope you'll find them useful :)

/me wonders if anyone is publishing non-bogus hard drive MTBF numbers by hard disk brand

[01:07:00.0000] <annevk>
ok, what am I missing?

[01:07:01.0000] <annevk>
<div><button></div>X

[01:07:02.0000] <annevk>
in Opera and Firefox the "X" is not inside the <button>

[01:07:03.0000] <annevk>
afaict in HTML5 <button> is closed at </div>

[01:08:00.0000] <annevk>
both html5lib and livedom.validator.nu put X inside the <button>

[01:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
<button> is scoping in html5

[01:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
so it isn't closed at </div>

[01:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
which reminds me that livedom is very much out of date

[01:12:00.0000] <annevk>
ah, you're right

[01:12:01.0000] <annevk>
/me misremembered the definition of "has an element in scope"

[01:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
livedom updated (reload caches, etc.)

[01:13:01.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders which browsers does this like HTML5 then

[01:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
probably firefox, though maybe not with <div>

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
no browser exactly matches the parser algorithm

[01:14:01.0000] <annevk>
IE6 does it

[01:17:00.0000] <annevk>
Opera 10 does it

what version of Safari has querySelector support?

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>

[02:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, Safari 4 will have it

[02:24:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, I converted the logs from a recent #css telecon as a demo for how "topic:" lines might create subheadings. Look at 6pm onwards, here: http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/irc-logs/day-telecon

[02:25:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijhn, lines to/from you are coloured as if you were fantasai, to test how it looks when most lines get that colour. :)

[02:28:00.0000] <krijnh>
BenMillard: you're putting way too much time in this ;)

[02:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: i almost see no difference between the light green and the white

[02:30:00.0000] <krijnh>
BenMillard: using "Topic: foo" as an indicator?

[02:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, yeah

[02:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, some people can, some can't. I just copied the colour from the boxes in HTML5 spec. :)

[02:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
"OpenOffice.org requires a Java runtime environment" (JRE) to perform this task. Please install a JRE and restart OpenOffice.org" Usability FTW

[02:34:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.fontsquirrel.com/ is nice

[02:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
(I have a JRE installed BTW)

[02:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, I'm using a big CRT at 1600x1200 with low contrast and normal brightness, and I find it easy for me to see the difference. I can well imagine it's hard to tell the difference from laptops and maybe from TFTs. What colour looks better to you?

[02:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I've considered using the stringer green for "lines to/from you" and then use the :target orange for important lines...then find a new colour for :target lines

[02:36:01.0000] <BenMillard>
s/stringer/stronger/

[02:36:02.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: #dfd wfm

[02:36:03.0000] <annevk>
I suppose the main problem with most free fonts is that they do not cover the whole Unicode range

[02:36:04.0000] <annevk>
well, most expensive fonts don't either, but at least cover more

[02:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
that would make them unusable as webfonts anyway

[02:37:01.0000] <annevk>
than just ASCII

[02:37:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, not necessarily, you could subset them when you use them

[02:37:03.0000] <zcorpan>
(however for swedish purpuses åäö has to work)

[02:37:04.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: ah ok

[02:37:05.0000] <zcorpan>
how?

[02:37:06.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders how many fonts total cover the whole unicode range

[02:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Like I guess the STIX fonts do if they ever actually released those

[02:38:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, with some font editor; someone should probably write a web service when webfonts become more common

[02:38:02.0000] <annevk>
enter a bunch of characters and a font file and get a nice compressed version

[02:38:03.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, that stays reasonably close to the spec. I'll try it in my user stylesheet for the current logs, maybe I'll prefer it. :)

[02:40:00.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, what script do you use to detect code snippets?

[02:40:01.0000] <krijnh>
I don't think he does ;)

[02:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, krijnh is correct.

[02:41:01.0000] <krijnh>
So the code snippets are a no-go for me

[02:41:02.0000] <annevk>
I see...

[02:41:03.0000] <BenMillard>
at the moment it's manual, based on searching for tell-tale sequences like space+:, word-word, <foo>, etc

[02:41:04.0000] <krijnh>
The rest is possible, I think

[02:41:05.0000] <krijnh>
But it takes a lot extra parsing for each line

[02:41:06.0000] <zcorpan>
krijnh: i'd like to see checkboxes instead of the current boxes

[02:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
camelCase, foo:bar, foo(), foo.bar, things like this

[02:42:01.0000] <krijnh>
zcorpan: yeah, me too

[02:42:02.0000] <BenMillard>
the code snippets are a "blue sky thinking" kinda thing, I don't expect them to happen soon (or perhaps ever)

[02:43:00.0000] <krijnh>
Probably too buggy to automate

[02:44:00.0000] <annevk>
I think the hourly headings are nice

[02:44:01.0000] <BenMillard>
krijnh, too buggy to automate in a simple way, for sure.

[02:44:02.0000] <krijnh>
I think all the extra fluff is nice :)

[02:44:03.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, thanks. Seemed useful for people who catch up on logs after knowing what time they left the previous day.

[02:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
or for checking the proceedings of a meeting they knew started at a specific time

[02:47:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems the checkbox label should wrap around the entire line

[02:48:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, I did that initially but it makes copy-paste of what people say have an unexpected side-effect. :)

[02:48:01.0000] <annevk>
true, then maybe have no label at all...

[02:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
that makes the clickable area too small, imho. "Every engineering decision is a comprimise."

[02:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
in Windows, selecting the name and the line does not tick the checkbox when only the name is a label

[02:50:01.0000] <BenMillard>
either the drag ends outside of the label, or it starts outside of the label

[02:50:02.0000] <annevk>
but for accessibility it seems better not to have labels than to have these

[02:50:03.0000] <annevk>
as hopefully heuristics for missing labels are better than what you give people now

[02:52:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, I'm not sure how good they are now, but a year ago they were pretty basic. I could ask people to test it for me.

[02:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me wwishes that the ECMAScript people were not such fans of undefined behaviour

[02:58:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, my current thinking is it's bettter to provide a short bit of labelling text because of Fitt's Law. This is also an accessibility advantage for users with mild mobility and dexterity problems. Screen reader users can move up and down the line if they want more context. I'll ask around.

[02:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Couldn't you just make the checkbox larger, rather than adding a label, if you care about the clickable size?

[03:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Actually that's probably a stupid idea because it can't be any taller and it shouldn't be non-square)

[03:08:00.0000] <annevk>
http://twitter.com/ilinsky/status/1130145181

[03:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: doesn't html5 actually allow an arbitrary amount of nested headers (just that the algorithm stops at the first just like gez says ATs do)?

[03:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Does the table inspector behave differently?

[03:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me reimplements the meta prescan by reusing the tokenization algorithm

[03:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ALA about mobile browsing recommends creating 4 stylesheets using '<link media>', '@import', '@import media' and media queries: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/returnofthemobilestylesheet

[03:36:01.0000] <annevk>
sounds like a lot of overhead :/

[03:37:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, apparently it's to work around web browsers ignoring media="handheld"...which makes me wonder how long it will be before they ignore media queries used this way, and then the next syntax for it, then the next, etc :)

[03:37:01.0000] <BenMillard>
web browsers on mobiles, i mean

[03:38:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I thought this was the behaviour mobiles would converge on: "2. Some read only the handheld style sheet if there is one, but default to the screen style sheet otherwise."

[03:39:00.0000] <annevk>
no, we're converging on just accepting media queries

[03:39:01.0000] <annevk>
and ignoring handheld altogether

[03:39:02.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, that's annoying

[03:39:03.0000] <annevk>
why?

[03:40:00.0000] <annevk>
way more likely people design properly for media queries, because they can easily test that on desktop

[03:40:01.0000] <annevk>
most handheld style sheets actually give a poor user experience

[03:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: no the inspector does what i expect

[03:41:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, I've read that in several places but not seen examples of it. Are any documented?

[03:42:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, "handheld" is easier for me to author. It is readable, easy to remember and leaves lets devices pick the stylesheet which suits their capabilities.

[03:42:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, the media queries in that ALA article assume devices below a certain number of horizontal pixels can't do full-screen layout.

[03:43:00.0000] <annevk>
well, that seems buggy, mobile devices support the same CSS apart from some tat are flawed

[03:45:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, in my experience mobile devices are highly diverse in what they support and how they present it.

[03:45:01.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, better to let the device decide if it wants a linearised, simplified "handheld" stylesheet or if it can handle a desktop-like "screen" layout?

[03:45:02.0000] <zcorpan>
i tried to create a mobile layout for opera mini for my mom's site but i ended up putting it all in @media handheld because it just screwed up and the normal layout was more useful on mini anyway

[03:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
I provide a linearising "handheld" stylesheet here, which works nicely on mobiles which have no zooming and apply the logic from "2" in the ALA article: http://calthorpepark.hants.sch.uk/

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, the net result of that is that nobody wants handheld

[03:47:01.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, users want a similar experience to desktop

[03:48:00.0000] <annevk>
I usually hate it when sites give me a limited mobile variant without way to opt out, e.g. klm.com does that and I need to URL hack them to get into the normal site

[03:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, I hate that too, which is why I think the devices should decide based on <link media> rather than authors dictating it via media queries based on available width in pixels.

[03:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
mobiles without zooming work better with linearised layouts. mobiles with zooming might have fewer available pixels across their width but still want the full layout

[03:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
we might end up having to lie about the device pixels

[03:51:01.0000] <annevk>
we already do

[03:51:02.0000] <annevk>
about widths, etc.

[03:51:03.0000] <annevk>
of the viewport and such

[03:51:04.0000] <zcorpan>
wrt media queries?

[03:51:05.0000] <annevk>
i assume with media queries as well, because they should follow layout in principle

[03:51:06.0000] <Philip`>
People will probably design media=handheld stylesheets for the lowest common denominator of handheld devices, because they want it to work in as many as possible, but then anyone making a device slightly better than the lowest common denominator won't want to constrained by that stylesheet and would benefit from using the proper desktop one

[03:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't think we lie in media queries (based on my testing last week with mini)

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
k

[03:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
how does Mobile Safari handle view port mqs? do they query the view port at readable zoom?

[03:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Mini does that, right?

[03:53:03.0000] <zcorpan>
i think so

[03:56:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?p=107 :/ how is that fricking better than HTML5?

[03:57:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, because hsivonen doesn't do landmark roles

[03:57:01.0000] <annevk>
/me sighs

[03:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: "a problem with this is these rules do not allow ARIA landmark roles"

[03:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
though if one starts hacking schemas, why hack a DTD?

[03:58:01.0000] <annevk>
because of validator.w3.org legacy?

[04:01:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"[...] I am not advocating the use of a custom DTD in published documents, but would like to be able to check my ARIA code."

[04:01:01.0000] <BenMillard>
sounds like he wants a QA tool, not a markup validator?

[04:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: A markup validator is a QA tool

[04:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: there's demand for ARIA validators that'd silently accept anything as far as the non-ARIA bits go

[04:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
which UAs support the landmarks and why don't they also support the corresponding HTML5 stuff?

[04:03:00.0000] <annevk>
to be honest, I don't like it that people already use <section> and <header> here and there

[04:03:01.0000] <annevk>
how are we going to adjust styling if adoption is there?

[04:03:02.0000] <roc>
/me discovers that xlink:href attributes in SVG <script> elements are animateable

[04:03:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I don't like it, either.

[04:04:00.0000] <annevk>
"SVG SUCKS"

[04:04:01.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I meant a tool specially for checking and debugging ARIA, like hsivonen mentions there's demand for.

[04:04:02.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, something like a Javascript debugger more than a markup validator.

[04:04:03.0000] <annevk>
roc, though kidding aside, surely that's a bug?

[04:05:00.0000] <roc>
seems they deliberately made all href attributes animateable

[04:05:01.0000] <annevk>
sweet, with that and dynamic base URLs, headaches and crashes ensue

[04:06:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, I guess the articles and presentations about HTML5 shouldn't be telling authors to try using the sectioning elements, then?

[04:06:01.0000] <roc>
there are fun scenarios about when script executes if a script file is loaded via animated href

[04:06:02.0000] <annevk>
BenMillard, either that or we should fix the styling problem and deploy it in browsers, preferably starting with something that has some user base, i.e. Gecko

[04:07:00.0000] <roc>
there are more fun scenarios about <use> with animated href causing the loading of external documents, possibly containing their own animations pointing back to the document containing the <use>

[04:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I still think <header> and <section> will mostly be failures without an outline depth-based selector

[04:08:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i think anything other than display:block shouldn't be in the UA's stylesheets for the new elements

[04:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: the UA style sheet could adjust the size of hn nested in <section> based on the afore-mentioned depth selector

[04:09:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: yeah maybe

[04:09:02.0000] <roc>
fortunately it appears that the href attribute of animation elements, identifying the element to be animated, cannot itself be animated

[04:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
although maybe that would break author expectations (i use h6 because it's small and nice, now i switched to html5 markup it's as big as a h2!)

[04:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: <section> would be the opt in to the new world

[04:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: yes but my point is that maybe authors don't expect their headings to change size when they switch from div to section

[04:12:01.0000] <zcorpan>
if that's a good thing or not i don't know

[04:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: I think that would be good

[04:16:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe only for <h1> sizes should be adjusted

[04:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: That sounds bad because it means that there is a disconnect between the semantics and the style

[04:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it would have to be some disconnect anyway because we wouldn't want to change the size of <h6> outside <section> (which per html5 is equivalent to <h1>)

[04:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: separation of semantics and style! :-)

[04:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i.e. <body><h6>foo</h6><section><h2>bar</h2></section>

[04:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, I guess the <section>-free case has to suck :(

[04:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
BenMillard: I would expect validtaor.nu to (eventually) validate the contents of aria-*

[04:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
Wow my typing sucks

[04:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: it already does, doesn't it?

[04:27:00.0000] <annevk>
there's <!doctype html>, <meta charset=utf-8>, <script> and <style> without type="", what else did we simplify?

[04:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Er, I don't know. I assumed it didn't from what BenMillard said

[04:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
But I guess he was talking about something different

[04:30:00.0000] <BenMillard>
annevk, certain elements have a more lenient meaning and presentational elements are shown as being useful. That makes choosing a suitable element easier, imho.

[04:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: profile

[04:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
Like a Firebug for aria

[04:30:03.0000] <hsivonen>
It would be great to have V.nu in Firebug. I just don't have the cycles to do it.

[04:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, a markup validator only tests the initial ARIA embedded in the markup. Checking the ARIA with scripting running enables proper troubleshooting and QA. This makes me think a specialised tool running in the browser (along the lines of Firebug and Dragonfly) are what ARIA authors would find most useful.

[04:31:01.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, what you both just said :P

[04:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
porting Jing onto Google Web Toolkit should be doable, although compiling it would take an insanely long time

[04:32:01.0000] <BenMillard>
hsivonen, the HTML Validator Extension added the W3C validator as an extension to Firefox. Maybe that developer would be interested with integrating the HTML5 validation? http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/

[04:32:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, profile is an open issue :)

[04:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
perhaps it would require an switch in the GWT compliler to optimize *less*

[04:32:04.0000] <hsivonen>
BenMillard: perhaps

[04:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder why steve hacked a dtd instead of hacking hsivonen's schema. perhaps validator.nu is a black box to him and he didn't want to approach hsivonen directly?

[04:33:01.0000] <BenMillard>
/me uses that extension all the time.

[04:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: oh, I know it's an issue for steve, and I want to fix it--I just have so many things to do

[04:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me invokes cloneNode on hsivonen

[04:35:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ok. still, he could have hacked your schema instead of the dtd

[04:35:02.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: shallow clone? or with children?

[04:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
does hsivonen have children? :)

[04:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
dunno :)

[04:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
applying the DOM api to humans is likely to be more messy than in IE

[04:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Maybe that is why hsivonen has gone quiet

[04:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
I broke his internal state

[04:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
:-)

[04:43:01.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, wasn't that bit undefined? :p

[04:44:00.0000] <annevk>
though then again, hsivonen is probably not a subclass of Node

[04:44:01.0000] <annevk>
to begin with

[04:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: when will you implement the svgs on your blog? :)

[04:58:00.0000] <annevk>
likely tomorrow or tonight unless I finish my slides really quickly

[05:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
cool

[05:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
"someone should probably write a web service when webfonts become more common" - has nobody already done that, even just for EOTs? It seems a fairly obvious thing for someone to provide

[05:13:00.0000] <annevk>
the EOT tool does that

[05:13:01.0000] <annevk>
but it's EOT specific

[05:13:02.0000] <annevk>
and not a web service

[05:14:00.0000] <annevk>
and EOT is not that popular

[06:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notices there's an HTML5+RDFa preset in validator.nu

[06:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wasn't aware that it was easy to make the WHATWG and HTMLWG versions of the spec diverge

[06:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
That seems like a bad idea

[06:55:02.0000] <rubys>
Ian didn't say it was easy

[06:56:00.0000] <annevk>
I think it's quite easy

[06:57:00.0000] <annevk>
just annotate the section somehow and pre-process it

[06:57:01.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure it's a good idea though

[06:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
Well I'm sure anolis can be made to do it. But it still seems bad

[06:58:00.0000] <annevk>
who objected to Origin exactly?

[06:58:01.0000] <annevk>
Origin is quite important and implemented in various clients already

[06:58:02.0000] <annevk>
and depends on HTML5 and vice versa

[06:58:03.0000] <rubys>
the suggestion is that it be pursued in the IETF

[06:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
By "easy" I meant "possible without modifying the spec generator code or maintaining two entirely different source files"

[06:59:01.0000] <annevk>
but HTML5 would still need to say that UAs include it for <form> submission

[06:59:02.0000] <rubys>
Perhaps Henri's response to the action is a bit incomplete?

[06:59:03.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, there is already some pre-process step before stuff goes to the spec generator

[07:00:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, removing a block seems trivial

[07:00:01.0000] <annevk>
rubys, I thought he summarized the situation quite accurately

[07:00:02.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, well maybe it is easier than I thought then

[07:00:03.0000] <rubys>
I didn't read in Henri's response that HTML5 depends on origin and vice versa.  Going back to reread...

[07:00:04.0000] <jgraham>
Now there is just the question of whether it makes sense 

[07:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
why the rush to remove it anyway?

[07:02:00.0000] <rubys>
issue raised 2008-12-02.  You call that a rush?

[07:03:00.0000] <annevk>
last publication, June 2008

[07:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: until it's in another spec i don't see why it should be removed

[07:07:01.0000] <annevk>
(which did not include this feature)

[07:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how much font files can be compressed, and discovers that Gentium contains 16KB of licensing information

[07:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It has the SIL Open Font License in ASCII, and then has it again in UTF-16)

[07:15:02.0000] <jcranmer>
no EBCIDIC?

[07:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
And it is now almost 14 years since the project started

[07:16:01.0000] <annevk>
sounds familiar

[07:22:00.0000] <annevk>
standards follow a similar schedule

[07:22:01.0000] <rubys>
not usually

[07:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
14 years? Did they even have computers back then?

[07:22:03.0000] <rubys>
lol

[07:22:04.0000] <rubys>
/me mutters "kids"

[07:22:05.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I assume that's when they planned to carve the fonts into stone tablets

[07:22:06.0000] <Philip`>
OpenType is a bit complex :-(

[07:22:07.0000] <jgraham>
Although maybe that _is_ what they are doing given the time it is taking

[07:22:08.0000] <Lachy_>
rubys, I really don't like the idea of removing the Origin header from the HTMLWG copy while retaining it in the WHATWG copy. I agree with zcorpan's mail: there is no rush to remove it

[07:22:09.0000] <rubys>
Speak up on the list, I already said above that I'm willing to demote the status of the issue to "Raised".

[07:22:10.0000] <Philip`>
I have no idea who SIL are but I like how they develop decent free fonts and libraries

[07:22:11.0000] <rubys>
My issue isn't with the Origin header, my issue is with the cavalier approach the W3C takes with the issues list.

[07:22:12.0000] <Lachy_>
rubys, I would, but I don't have anything particularly new to add beyond what zcorpan said

[07:22:13.0000] <rubys>
/me looking for zcorpan's mail

[07:22:14.0000] <Lachy_>
http://www.w3.org/mid/op.un0fi6unidj3kv@hp-a0a83fcd39d2

[07:23:00.0000] <rubys>
Hmmm.  That didn't address the question.  Thinking...

[07:25:00.0000] <rubys>
Thinking out loud: Spec'ed "somewhere" isn't the issue.  The issue is scope of the html-wg.  Things without consensus shouldn't appear in the W3C draft.  I have zero control over what goes into the WHATWG draft.  There appear to be no credible plans to ever republish the WHATWG document as a W3C draft at this time.  Does that about cover the current status?

[07:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, Hixie has said multiple times that he isn't following the strictly concensus based approach for good reasons: it doesn't work; and I don't think we should start now

[07:29:00.0000] <rubys>
Noted.  I strongly disagree, but noted.

[07:29:01.0000] <hallvors>
rubys, 'speced "somewhere"' is a big issue. It's called "avoid leaving things underspecified".

[07:29:02.0000] <Lachy>
I know you do, and I've noticed you've been trying to push concensus based approaches to resolve a few issues recently

[07:30:00.0000] <hallvors>
unfortunately using that as a principle bloats the HTML5 spec if noone else picks up loose ends :(

[07:30:01.0000] <rubys>
There are many, many, many areas in HTML5 over which there is strong agreement.  I want those to proceed without being held up by areas over which agreement can not be reached.

[07:31:00.0000] <rubys>
Having a master document which contains everything and marks specific sections based on their status doesn't sound like such a bad idea given that as a context.

[07:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, the "can/can't live with" approach you've used for the Flash/Silverlight section and the DOCTYPE compat issue seems to be concensus driven based on nothing but personal preference and popular opinion. I really hope you can see what's wrong with that

[07:33:00.0000] <rubys>
I see the DOCTYPE compat issue as having a successful resolution.

[07:34:00.0000] <rubys>
I loved your email on the Flash/Silverlight topic.  And believe that such an opinion would not have surfaced *unless* the issue was pushed as it has been.

[07:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, thankfully that discussion didn't get many "can/can't live with" responses, but was rather driven by evidence from Philip, newly proposed solutions and technical justifications

[07:35:00.0000] <rubys>
Thankfully?  If anybody had tried to say "can't live with" without adequate justification, I would have pushed back strongly *until* there was evidence such as Philip provided.

[07:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, I don't have a problem with raising issues with the spec. I have a problem with the way you're attempting to resolve them by simply asking if people are ok with it, rather than actually encouraging people to look at the evidence

[07:36:00.0000] <rubys>
I am *not* simply asking them if they are OK with it.

[07:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's the impression I get from your emails

[07:36:02.0000] <rubys>
That leads to bikesheding.

[07:36:03.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: Maybe you are being too subtle

[07:36:04.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps you could express yourself more clearly

[07:37:00.0000] <hallvors>
/me googles bikeshedding

[07:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
To me "Can't live with" means something like "I would make a Formal Objection to the spec if this went in"

[07:38:00.0000] <rubys>
jgraham: agreed.  And to me, a Formal Objection is a bit more than "I would prefer option 3 over option 2"

[07:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
So I could "live with" lots of bad things individually. But given too many of them the spec would be pretty crappy

[07:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me could live with HTML not existing at all

[07:38:03.0000] <rubys>
A perfectly wonderful outcome would have been five options that everybody could live with.  I would simply have said in that case: editor, you are free to pick one.

[07:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
Pushing through to "Can't Live With" too early seems to have the strong possibility of preventng four of those five options from surfacing

[07:39:01.0000] <rubys>
But as it was, people not only said what they couldn't live with, but more importantly, they said why.  And those reasons made sense.

[07:40:00.0000] <rubys>
jgraham: I don't like talking abstractly.  I find too often that things that don't work in theory often work in practice, and vice versa.  Did we get a successful outcome to the legacy compat issue?  Was that resolution a result of me pushing?

[07:42:00.0000] <rubys>
And to be perfectly clear: I really would have been happy if nobody could have raised a "can't live with" objection to any of the listed alternatives.  I don't know how I can say that any more clearly.

[07:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: So far we have no outcome to the issue :) But yes, in that case it looks like people pushing against the attitude of "Can't Live With" gave us a option that may be good enough to a problem with very little technical complexity

[07:42:02.0000] <rubys>
baby steps

[07:42:03.0000] <jgraham>
It's not clear what would happen in a different situation

[07:42:04.0000] <rubys>
let's find out

[07:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
the proposed resolution was a result of the issue being raised, but the resolution isn't necessarily final yet. There are still some issues with <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:sgml-compat"> that I would like to investigate

[07:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
in particular, how well do common consumers handle SYSTEM doctypes when they can't resolve the URI to a DTD

[07:43:02.0000] <rubys>
if you find an issue, please raise it.  You can even raise an issue after Ian makes the change. 

[07:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
I tested OpenSP briefly this morning and it seems to have some issues. I'm not sure if there's a way to either override the DOCTYPE or make it non-validating

[07:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me tries validator.w3.org

[07:45:01.0000] <zcorpan>
"Fatal Error: cannot find "about:sgml-compat"; tried"

[07:45:02.0000] <rubys>
As I said in a prior email, Ian was willing to make the change last week.  I asked that it remain open until at least Thursday for exactly this reason.

[07:45:03.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: I don't know what deadline I should ask for. 

[07:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
the validator would have to be updated to detect the new DOCTYPE in the same way it detects <!DOCTYPE html>

[07:46:01.0000] <rubys>
hsivonen: which issue?

[07:47:00.0000] <rubys>
I'm willing to demote issue 63 to raised

[07:47:01.0000] <zcorpan>
 Line 1, Column 34: invalid formal public identifier "sgml-legacy": missing //.

[07:47:02.0000] <zcorpan>
<!doctype html public "sgml-legacy">

[07:47:03.0000] <jgraham>
sgml//legacy?

[07:47:04.0000] <rubys>
the proposal was "about:sgml-legacy

[07:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: yeah, i tried that first, got a fatal error

[07:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, actually, it was about:sgml-compat

[07:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: the Origin header thing

[07:49:02.0000] <rubys>
sounds worthy of a "can't live with" objection.

[07:50:00.0000] <rubys>
hsivonen: that's issue 63.  I'm willing to demote the issue to raised and leave the date open.

[07:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: the goal is about compat with legacy producers. We aren't trying to be compatible with OpenSP consumers.

[07:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: ok. one of the sensible approaches to the issue would entail leaving the references into the text anyway

[07:51:01.0000] <rubys>
/me notes that noting not all consumers can process this DOCTYPE will be a *heck* of a lot more effective than employing a pejorative text

[07:52:00.0000] <rubys>
such a doctype could even merit a validator warning

[07:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Perhaps it's a problem that "can't live with" sounds like a personal view, and personally I don't care at all about XSLT or doctypes because they're not relevant to anything I'll ever do, but I'm still interested in finding technical issues that can inform the opinions of people who do care

[07:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
so rather than "can you live with this?", the question should be "can you live with this, or do you have any new information that might affect other people's views of whether they can live with this?", but that's not very concise really

[07:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I was mostly interested in checking the DOCTYPE's compatibility with XML consumers, not text/html consumers, under the assumption that it could conceivably end up being used in XHTML documents despite it being unnecessary

[07:57:02.0000] <rubys>
I will quickly push back on people who attempt to say "can't live with" for purely spurious reasons

[07:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, can I suggest that instead of asking people to state whether they can or can't live with something, be more direct in asking for evidence for or against proposals

[07:59:00.0000] <rubys>
My experience is that that isn't quite as effective.  It promotes bikeshedding.  I simply want to exclude the options that don't work, and leave it up to the editor to select from those that will.

[08:00:00.0000] <annevk>
so far rubys approach seems to work fine

[08:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me expects there will still be bikeshedding because the editor didn't choose x's preferred choice

[08:01:00.0000] <annevk>
I should probably say rubys'

[08:01:01.0000] <zcorpan>
rubys: a solution A might well work and might even be technically better than solution B even though someone can't live with A but everyone can live with B

[08:01:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, but someone will only be heard if given good reason

[08:02:00.0000] <annevk>
afaict it's the same idea we've followed for ages with a new approach

[08:03:00.0000] <annevk>
and if that works better socially, lets go for it

[08:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
if the decision in the end is exclusively based on the reasons then it's fine

[08:05:01.0000] <rubys>
if A, B, and C all work, I'm quite willing to let the editor do a coin flip

[08:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not sure that would work - the editor probably doesn't have a three-sided coin

[08:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, he could roll a dice and assign 2 sides to each option

[08:07:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, it just seems a bit conservative to object to rubys' approach at this point because so far it works

[08:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: That wouldn't be a coin flip

[08:08:01.0000] <annevk>
or seems to work anyway, nothing has concluded yet

[08:08:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me suggests using 'heads' 'tails' and 'edge'

[08:08:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me also thinks you can't emulate a three-sided coin using multiple flips of a two-sided coin, because they don't have common factors, but he could be totally wrong

[08:08:04.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah, i'm not objecting to it, although the scenario i outlined might well occur

[08:08:05.0000] <rubys>
/me hates hypothetical scenarios

[08:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I imagine XSD has many things that people were able to live with

[08:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Flip if 6 times?

[08:09:02.0000] <annevk>
apart from the hypothetical note, how can someone not live with A without giving good reason?

[08:09:03.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, rubys' approach has obtained objections on the mailing list from both Hixie and hsivonen because it's wasn't clear that rubys really wanted justifications, rather than just running more like a vote

[08:09:04.0000] <rubys>
... especially if it works well (as stipulated)

[08:09:05.0000] <annevk>
and if that reason is indeed good, why would everyone else like both?

[08:10:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, sure, new things always require some guidance

[08:10:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i didn't say he wouldn't provide a good reason

[08:10:02.0000] <zcorpan>
anyway

[08:10:03.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, if he provides a good reason that would mean A might not be so good... I'd love some research and concrete examples here :p

[08:17:00.0000] <rubys>
/me notes that people are saying that they "can't live with" the "can't live approach" but haven't produced any evidence as to why it won't work

[08:18:00.0000] <rubys>
:-P

[08:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: How would that work? You'd get 64 possible outcomes, and you can't evenly divide them into three classes

[08:18:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: don't know any example off-hand but i'll let you know

[08:18:03.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Yes, I was being dumb

[08:18:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: But can you do it if you don't distinguish options with the same set of outcomes, regardless of sequence?

[08:18:05.0000] <karlcow>
/me can live with everything as long if it's done in a good spirit, and with smooth social interactions. so far kudos to sam who did quite well.

[08:18:06.0000] <jgraham>
You maybe can't get all the probabilities to be equal :(

[08:18:07.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: That would just be constructing groups out of the 64 events each with P=1/64, and you can't split them into three equal groups

[08:18:08.0000] <jgraham>
Yes, I realised that

[08:18:09.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose you could do it if you don't mind the potential for taking infinitely long

[08:18:10.0000] <jgraham>
It seems so odd that it isn't possible

[08:18:11.0000] <Philip`>
Flip 2 coins to get 4 outcomes, and if it's 1-3 then that's the answer, otherwise try again

[08:18:12.0000] <karlcow>
for what is worth, my coin has 3 sides

[08:18:13.0000] <danbri>
what's the preferred way for an html5 doc to declare charset? <meta charset="UTF-8"> ?

[08:18:14.0000] <annevk>
danbri, that and the old way are ok, HTTP is also fine

[08:18:15.0000] <jgraham>
Oh yeah. That would work. Now work out how many times Hixie will have to flip his coin on average and then determine the expected time for the two sides to wear away so they are indistinguishable

[08:18:16.0000] <karlcow>
danbri: <meta charset="UTF-8"> or <meta charset="UTF-8"/> or http headers

[08:18:17.0000] <annevk>
danbri, BOM as well, I don't think any of these is endorsed over the other

[08:18:18.0000] <annevk>
others, even

[08:18:19.0000] <zcorpan>
/me prefers http header

[08:18:20.0000] <jgraham>
karlcow: Not counting "edge"?

[08:18:21.0000] <rubys>
/me notes that meta charset is not currently endorsed for XHTML

[08:18:22.0000] <jgraham>
/me prefers <meta charset>

[08:18:23.0000] <rubys>
/me really wishes it were

[08:18:24.0000] <karlcow>
jgraham: I have two faces and one edge = 3 sides :)

[08:18:25.0000] <jgraham>
karlcow: Only really counts if you have a rather large edge :)

[08:19:00.0000] <karlcow>
euros, hk dollars for example work quite well, with two of them just now

[08:19:01.0000] <karlcow>
i18n ;)

[08:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: Having apparent encoding metadata that is actually not used in processing seems bad

[08:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
Alhtough I guess that's the model HTTP adopts

[08:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: The average number of throws is just 1*(3/4) + 2*(1/4)*(3/4) + 3*(1/4)^2*(3/4) + ... I think, but I've forgotten how to calculate infinite series

[08:20:02.0000] <rubys>
it is used if intermediaries f*** with your headers.  Don't say it doesn't happen.

[08:20:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: a/(1-r)

[08:20:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: (for a geometric sequence)

[08:20:05.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It's not geometric

[08:20:06.0000] <gsnedders>
What sort of sequence?

[08:20:07.0000] <danbri>
i'll try  <meta charset="UTF-8" /> for now

[08:20:08.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Or what sequence?

[08:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It's the one I said a few lines ago :-)

[08:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me wants to see karlcow's 3 sided coin (given the impossibility of creating a 3 sided, 3 dimentional shape)

[08:21:02.0000] <jgraham>
sigma(n(3/4)^n)

lachy?

[08:21:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: It's just a cylinder

[08:21:05.0000] <karlcow>
a coin has 3 sides

[08:21:06.0000] <karlcow>
a cylinder

[08:21:07.0000] <Philip`>
Fortunately Perl can calculate near-enough-to-infinite series and tells me the answer is 4/3

[08:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
karlcow: A coin only has one side (the outside)

[08:22:01.0000] <karlcow>
or if you indulge my French, a camembert 

[08:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, ah, I meant flat sides

[08:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
you can't land on the edge of a coin in practice

[08:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If it's a really fat coin :)

[08:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could glue many coins together, until it lands on the side roughly a third of the time

[08:23:02.0000] <karlcow>
:)

[08:23:03.0000] <rubys>
you can solve this easily yourself: write down "x = sigma(n(3/4)^n)"  Next write "(3/4)x = sigma(n(3/4)^(n+1))", and subtract the two equations (it is helpful to expand the sigma doing this".  Then simply solve for x.

[08:23:04.0000] <Philip`>
but it'd probably be really easy to cheat by throwing it so it spins along its axis and always lands on its edge

[08:24:00.0000] <karlcow>
Half a cork would do

[08:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that it's actually sigma(n * 1/4^(n-1) * 3/4)

[08:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
(not that it makes much difference in practice)

[08:25:00.0000] <karlcow>
plus the probability will become more and more interesting each time you have to open a bottle :)

[08:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: Oh, that seems to work quite easily

[08:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
(since it gives 3/4x = a geometric series which sums to 1)

[08:27:01.0000] <rubys>
if you select the right term, you end up with fraction*x = a simple value

[08:28:00.0000] <rubys>
what you select is the term which will cause each entry in the series to shift over by one.

[08:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't see how that's possible in this case

[08:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
(where 'this case' is basically x = r + 2r^2 + 3r^3 + ...)

[08:29:01.0000] <karlcow>
hmmm not a new question (as usual) https://home.comcast.net/~davejanelle/coin3.htm

[08:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
(so if you shift it and subtract then you're still left with an infinite series but you lose all the 2* and 3* bits)

[08:30:01.0000] <rubys>
how did that n get in there?  you have 3/4 of a chance at first.  Then you have 3/4 of a chance for the remaining 1/4 of possibilities.

[08:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
The aim is to calculate the average number of throws needed

[08:31:01.0000] <karlcow>
http://www.statisticool.com/3sided.htm

[08:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
so there's a 3/4 chance of needing 1 throw, 3/4*1/4 of needing 2 throws, etc

[08:31:03.0000] <rubys>
ah, nevermind

[08:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Otherwise it'd just be calculating the probability that you eventually stop, which is fortunately approaching 1 :-)

[08:32:01.0000] <rubys>
ok, so the technique needs to be applied twice, but you shortcutted it be simply recognizing the sequence.

I was a math major, and have now helped two teenagers though this (the oldest no longer being a teenager)

[08:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is a computer scientist so he doesn't have to know any maths that has actual numbers in it

[08:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and especially not anything with non-integers)

[08:39:00.0000] <rubys>
I was a math major because when I went to school, there wasn't a computer science degree I could have pursued.

[08:41:00.0000] <karlcow>
nice article

[08:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: If you want to do HTML WG mail from Gmail, before the W3C gets around to changing your registered email address, you could possibly just forward it to Gmail and reply directly from there, since the mailing list accepts mail from any address (not just registered members)

[08:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I sort of do the opposite - my Gmail address is registered on the list, but I can read it through IMAP in Thunderbird and then I reply from a different address instead)

[08:47:00.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: no IEEE 754 floating point?

[08:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
jcranmer: Not as part of the CS stuff I'm working on

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I think in the past year, the extent of discussion around floating point was that someone commented that FP addition was non-associative and we don't know how to handle that in our theoretical model of the stuff we're working on so we'll ignore it for now)

[08:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
And floating point numbers are still really just integers anyway :-p

[08:52:00.0000] <jcranmer>
simple truth of computers: mathematical truths don't necessarily hold true when computers are involved

[08:54:00.0000] <rubys>
Since their email form doesn't work, and my [sysreq] submitted on Friday hasn

[08:54:01.0000] <rubys>
't worked, I just submitted a request for a second id.

[08:54:02.0000] <rubys>
we'll see how that goes.

[08:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's just a bit confusing when a+(b+c) != (a+b)+c

[08:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
(or at least it's a bit confusing to try to prove things about systems that involve algebras with that property)

[08:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
hallvors: I think you are much more optimisitic about the utility of enhanced copy/paste than me. 

[08:59:00.0000] <hallvors>
I think the web isn't very good at being copied.

[08:59:01.0000] <hallvors>
:-p

[09:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hallvors: didn't MS have something like that as "active clipboard" or similar Microsofty word plus "clipboard"?

[09:01:00.0000] <hallvors>
the "copy E-mail from webmail to mail client" example was somewhat far off, admittedly. but the bibliography thing could be done today and would be GREAT for anyone using web for research and word processors for writing essays and dissertations.

[09:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>

[09:01:04.0000] <hallvors>
I looked for that but the demos and such were not available now

[09:01:05.0000] <hsivonen>
/me forgot that MS things are now live rather than active

[09:01:06.0000] <jgraham>
On the one hand I can imagine producers not wanting to give up their data e.g. Facebook not wanting to make it easy to migrate data away from facebook

[09:01:07.0000] <rubys>
it was originally "universal"

[09:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
On the other hand I think complex things happening on "paste" break user expectations e.g. pasting from wikipedia shouldn't do anything other than insert the text

[09:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
People who use Facebook are too cool to use email, and people who copy-and-paste from Wikipedia into a word processor don't want their teacher to know they copied it

[09:03:00.0000] <hallvors>
jgraham: I sync my Facebook contact list with my local address book *manually*.. it would be a competitive advantage to any social network to make that easier for me.

[09:03:01.0000] <hallvors>
(if only they'd realise :-) )

[09:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
hallvors: But it is a competitive advantage to them not to as long as they are the market leader

[09:04:01.0000] <hallvors>
pasting into word processors these days usually gives you a floating palette toolbar thingy with options. I don't really like those but if one of the options were "create bibliographic entry for what you pasted" I'd use it a lot

[09:04:02.0000] <hallvors>
..and we're not writing HTML for the kiddies who cheat at school.. 

[09:05:00.0000] <hallvors>
not if e.g. myspace or orkut does it

[09:06:00.0000] <hallvors>
then it might suddenly be a competitive advantage to have that feature

[09:06:01.0000] <hallvors>
I need to sleep anyway.

[09:08:00.0000] <karlcow>
hmmm

[09:08:01.0000] <karlcow>
hallvors: facebook to your computer addressbook or the opposite?

[09:08:02.0000] <hallvors>
metadata stuff gets us quite deep into "UI problem" territory... 

[09:08:03.0000] <hallvors>
karlcow: why not both?

[09:09:00.0000] <karlcow>
ethics

[09:09:01.0000] <karlcow>
the data about people in my addressbook doesn't belong to me. People trusted me giving their information. 

[09:09:02.0000] <hallvors>
Facebook would detect an onpaste event and try to figure out the clipboard data

[09:10:00.0000] <karlcow>
and I don't feel the right to share these data with a 3rd party with a contract which makes the possibility to use these data

[09:10:01.0000] <hallvors>
if somebody gave you their E-mail address and you use it to search for them on facebook is it ethically wrong??

[09:11:00.0000] <karlcow>
if I don't know the retention policy of the service about this feature. yes it's wrong

[09:11:01.0000] <karlcow>
in my own way of dealing with data

[09:11:02.0000] <karlcow>
:)

[09:12:00.0000] <hallvors>
so will you take this to the logical conclusion that we should not enable any sort of data exchange because people might use it to expose data others gave them to thirdparties? :-o

[09:13:00.0000] <hallvors>
You need to find the Internet's off switch.. 

[09:13:01.0000] <karlcow>
hallvors: extreme position never solves things

[09:13:02.0000] <karlcow>
my simple take on it is "it depends on the context"

[09:13:03.0000] <karlcow>
for this we need mechanisms for knowing how we can use the data.

[09:14:00.0000] <hallvors>
I think it's a bit extreme to say it's wrong of me to search for you on Facebook by your E-mail.. 

[09:14:01.0000] <karlcow>
email, addresses and phone numbers of my friends are not *my* data. There are data which have been communicated under a moral contract (trust)

[09:14:02.0000] <karlcow>
hallvors: did I say that 

[09:15:00.0000] <karlcow>
hallvors: but yes if you put my email address or phone number on facebook I would consider that wrong.

[09:15:01.0000] <karlcow>
plus I'm not on facebook ;)

[09:15:02.0000] <hallvors>
with a caveat about retention policy, you said "yes, it's wrong"

[09:15:03.0000] <Philip`>
Technical solutions to moral/social problems are probably not going to be particularly effective

[09:15:04.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: you jumped to your own conclusions ;) not what I said

[09:17:00.0000] <karlcow>
ex of technology: creative commons licenses markup.  The fact after that you respect the license or not is another issue completely

[09:17:01.0000] <karlcow>
but at least there is a license

[09:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
There isn't technology that attempts to enforce that licence by preventing you from copying-and-pasting into a document with an incompatible licence

[09:18:01.0000] <karlcow>
the thing is that often right now there is no way for some data owners in some context to declare by technology "you can't use the data for this"

[09:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
(which sounds like what you're suggesting for preventing copying-and-pasting from your address book into Facebook)

[09:18:03.0000] <karlcow>
:) then sure you can decide to break or not

[09:19:00.0000] <karlcow>
not preventing, declaring

[09:20:00.0000] <karlcow>
when I give my phone number to a friend (verbally), I usually give a comment on the type: do not share this number with someone else or ask me before if you can do it.

[09:20:01.0000] <karlcow>
same thing for my home address

[09:20:02.0000] <hallvors>
If I search for your address on Google Maps I'm giving some of your personal data to Google. yet very few people would consider that an immoral thing to do..

[09:20:03.0000] <rubys>
few people realize how much google knows about them

[09:20:04.0000] <rubys>
http://www.google.com/search?q=sam+ruby+nc

[09:21:00.0000] <karlcow>
yes sam, only a few people, and not much effort is done in UI to make them aware of it. (killing business I guess)

[09:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonder if Google has enough data to make the voter registration thing obsolete

[09:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
*wonders

[09:24:00.0000] <hallvors>
/me is amused by Sam's post about lying to his GPS to get a correct route home

[09:25:00.0000] <hallvors>
Actually, these days Facebook doesn't need to support whatever-meta-data-embedding for such a proposal to be useful. 

[09:25:01.0000] <rubys>
looks like google maps at least has fresh data so lying eventually won't be necessary

[09:25:02.0000] <hallvors>
If the UA does some clever copy thing, one can have a user script / greasemonkey script that knows the target site's markup and creates the meta data

[09:25:03.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. Microsoft has fixed the bug I posted in Sam's comments

[09:26:00.0000] <hallvors>
in Japan GPS navigation seems very good.

[09:26:01.0000] <rubys>
which bug?

[09:27:00.0000] <hallvors>
..but then, they REALLY need it around here..

[09:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: the link at http://intertwingly.net/blog/2005/04/06/Dude-Wheres-My-Car#c1112998015 used to lead to a route search from one part of a Finnish to another part of the same city and MSN returned a very crazy route (IIRC traveling through Sweden or something like that)

[09:27:02.0000] <karlcow>
hallvors: not GPS, more likely celltowers triangulation because of the density of mobile phones. GPS doesn't work very well in the cities ;) no more sky

[09:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
IIRC, it suggested driving to northern Sweden, driving through Sweden, crossing over to southern Finland and driving back north

[10:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't think he's ever done so badly in a physics exam

[11:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I thought the same in a maths exam once, and then scored 100% on it (after normalisation of scores), so there's not necessarily much correlation between perception and reality :-)

[11:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It was fun getting more than 100% on tests due to extra credit (when I lived in Seattle)

[11:14:01.0000] <heycam>
roc, that was corrected in 1.2T (@xlink:href on <script> being animatable)

[11:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
One time I got extra credit on an extra credit question for spotting a mistake

[11:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I got 54%. I thought I did well. :)

[11:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Oh, if you actually got told the score then I suppose that's correlated with reality

[11:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I thought I had probably got a low A, not a low C.

[11:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I also got a B in computing, by not knowing what the right, sorry, wrong answers are.

[11:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
That sounds unfortunate

[12:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries to hack together a font subsetter

[12:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
When used for a dozen ASCII letters, a font like Gentium goes from 260KB to 25KB, of which 13KB is the licence text

[12:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
and annevk's big-noodle-titling goes from 26KB to 8KB, of which 4KB is the licence text

[12:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I've probably got lots of bugs that break kerning and everything, though)

[12:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: all browsers that support @font-face support gzip, don't they? 

[12:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: wouldn't it be safe to serve a gzipped font unconditionally without conneg?

[12:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
presumably that would take care of the license text

[12:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
With gzip, it's 3.5KB for big-noodle-titling and 11KB for Gentium

[12:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I want to try how hard it will be to use Linux Libertine, MgOpen Cosmetica and Libertine Mono with @font-face with strict license compliance

[12:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
i.e. providing full corresponding source code

[12:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Removing the copyright text and using gzip, it's 2.7KB and 7KB respectively

[12:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: does Gentium allow the removal of the license text and replacing it with the URL of the license?

[12:33:01.0000] <takkaria>
what constitutes source code in the case of fonts?

[12:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/render_download.php?site_id=nrsi&format=file&media_id=OFL_plaintext&filename=OFL.txt

[12:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: the preferred form for making modification, which is the FontForge input file

[12:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
"Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user."

[12:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
someone should make a font serving site that crawls the customer sites and subsets fonts automatically

[12:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: do you mean that it would subset it to include characters found in the text that uses the font?

[12:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: yes

[12:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so the crawler would need to be CSS-aware

[12:38:00.0000] <takkaria>
hmm, that wouldn't be too hard

[12:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
takkaria: except with JS adding more text :-)

[12:38:02.0000] <zcorpan>
or a comment form

[12:39:00.0000] <takkaria>
JS makes the idea unusable, I guess

[12:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
I was idealistically unrealistically thinking of making something vaguely like that

[12:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me would be happy if he could choose which characters to include from a character map or pasting the characters he wanted

[12:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
e.g. if i wanted to use a webfont for my mother's site's headings i'd want swedish and icelandic characters

[12:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me presumes the main concern for someone providing such a service would be the licensing of fonts

[12:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: one would only offer to serve OFL and GPL fonts

[12:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and Apache License 2.0 fonts

[12:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
And not let people upload their own fonts?

[12:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
right

[12:46:04.0000] <roc>
TTF fonts have an "installable" bit

[12:47:00.0000] <roc>
which basically means "free"

[12:47:01.0000] <roc>
a site could allow file uploads if it checked that bit

[12:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
Does that imply it allows derivative works too?

[12:47:03.0000] <zcorpan>
YouFont

[12:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
unsurprisingly there's such a site

[12:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
(named youfont i.e.)

[12:48:02.0000] <zcorpan>
(although it doesn't seem to be the same concept as youtube - i don't see any upload)

[12:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, if making the source of the font available is a requirement, then surely a URL for it in a CSS comment near the @font-face rule, or some other appropriate location, would be acceptable

[12:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
it the same with copyleft licenced software. You don't need to distribute the source with the binary, just make it available to those who want it

[13:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is this for real: http://twitter.com/zacharyjohnson/statuses/1131296427

[13:14:00.0000] <roc>
I wonder if http://alistapart.com/articles/semanticsinhtml5 is for real

[13:14:01.0000] <roc>
it sounds like another form of <tag name="section">

[13:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
it doesn't surprise me that there are still people out there hoping for the day that HTML will be replaced with semantically pure, XML based solutions

[13:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: it's not the XML part. it's the DTD part.

[13:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
XML standards types have moved to RELAX NG, Schematron and NVDL

[13:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
some are sticking to XSD, but DTD is really passé

[13:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>

Is Bitstream Vera / DejaVu compatible with embedding?

[13:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me didn't see anything in its licence that indicated otherwise

[13:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: seems linkable and embeddable to me

[13:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the list on webfonts.info is very incomplete as far as OFL and GPL fonts go

[14:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notes that annevk's big-noodle-titling is served as text/plain

[14:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(and so is the webfont i uploaded for daddy.svg)

[14:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
what's the correct MIME type for a font?

[14:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think there is no yet, but it's being discussed... i used font/ttf

[14:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, yeah, I remember http://annevankesteren.nl/2008/08/font-mime-types

[14:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
How do I make Opera stop using my system font instead of the @font-faced version that I want it to use?

[14:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It works more sensibly in Firefox, where it falls back to the page's default font for missing glyphs)

[14:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, can you demonstrate the problem?

[14:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Not easily

[14:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
How does Opera pick fallback fonts?

[14:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
I changed all the name strings in the font, so it can't just be matching those

[14:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: hey

[14:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, can you publish a test case of some kind?

[14:51:02.0000] <annevk>
http://twitter.com/Kroc/statuses/1131482645

[14:51:03.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, yo

[14:51:04.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, not going to happen tonight I'm afraid

[14:51:05.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, the SVG stuff

[14:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, yeah, that twitter message is a good reason to retain <ol type>

[14:52:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i just did it myself -- wanted to see how it would look :)

[14:52:02.0000] <annevk>
I see :)

[14:52:03.0000] <zcorpan>
although it looks terrible in safari and firefox (because they don't support svg in content)

[14:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
should i upload it?

[14:53:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i also got rid of fake-border

[14:56:00.0000] <takkaria>
more feed readers need css sanitisers

[14:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: http://philip.html5.org/tests/font/gentium-embedded.html

[14:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: probably with http://www.sil.org/~gaultney/Gentium/ already installed on your system

[14:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/render_download.php?site_id=nrsi&format=file&media_id=GentiumBasic_110&filename=GentiumBasic_110.zip in particular

[14:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: In Opera 10 build 4125 on Linux, the whole text is rendered in Gentium

[14:59:01.0000] <roc>
zcorpan: we don't support what what?

[14:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: whereas in Firefox 3.1 only the e/m/b/d letters are Gentium and the rest is default sans-serif, which is what I want it to be

[14:59:03.0000] <Philip`>
s/want/expect/

[15:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
roc: css 'content'

[15:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
works for me

[15:01:00.0000] <roc>
zcorpan: er

[15:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
using Opera 10 Mac, build 6196

[15:01:02.0000] <zcorpan>
roc: e.g. :before { content:url(foo.svg) }

[15:01:03.0000] <roc>
oh, SVG images

[15:01:04.0000] <roc>
OK

[15:01:05.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, sure

[15:01:06.0000] <Lachy>
it may be a bug an the older build that's now fixed

[15:01:07.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: WFM in Opera 10 on Mac

[15:01:08.0000] <roc>
yeah, that's next on my list

[15:01:09.0000] <roc>
but that should work in Webkit

[15:01:10.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, which build have you got?

[15:01:11.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: http://simon.html5.org/dump/anne.html

[15:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: 6166

[15:02:01.0000] <annevk>
oh, Firefox does do the hand?

[15:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries twiddling the test a bit

[15:02:03.0000] <annevk>
oh wait, that's Opera

[15:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i changed the search form stuff a bit to make it look right

[15:03:01.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe i broke it in some other browser

[15:03:02.0000] <Lachy>
it could be a linux specific bug. Who else has linux here that can test the latest internal builds?

[15:03:03.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, how odd

[15:03:04.0000] <Philip`>
I don't actually have Gentium installed, as far as I can tell

[15:03:05.0000] <Philip`>
so my hypothesis was faulty

[15:03:06.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, the logo is not updated?

[15:04:00.0000] <annevk>
uploaded

[15:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
so the question is: where is Opera getting the glyphs for all the other characters from? :-/

[15:04:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i haven't used sam's version of the logo

[15:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: maybe you have used a different webfont with the same name that opera cached?

[15:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[15:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
I'm being stupid

[15:06:03.0000] <Philip`>
It's not actually using Gentium, it's just using something that looks very similar

[15:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
I have no idea what Gentium is. Is that the name of the font you're embedding?

[15:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Somehow it's picking "Bitstream Charter" as the fallback, and I have no idea why)

[15:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Yes - see the links I posted some minutes ago

[15:07:03.0000] <Lachy>
is Bitstream Charter a serif font?

[15:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[15:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok. That is weird. It should be picking a sans-serif fallback font

[15:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: in case you are wondering, I do have Gentium installed

[15:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/tests/font/gentium-embedded-opera.png

[15:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: the logo is uploaded... doesn't it work?

[15:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's more obvious now than when I initially had 1em text :-(

[15:10:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, if you remove the @font-face, what fallback font does it use?

[15:10:03.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: A sans-serif one

[15:11:00.0000] <annevk>
now it does

[15:12:00.0000] <annevk>
still usable in Firefox

[15:12:01.0000] <annevk>
guess I'll use it then just for fun

[15:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
:)

[15:13:01.0000] <annevk>
though hopefully rubys can make the files somewhat smaller or maybe I should learn to use his tools + SVG

[15:13:02.0000] <zcorpan>
he uploaded a smaller version of the logo at least

[15:13:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, fonts are fun - I have one which looks terribly ugly in Opera, but the spacing in the subsetted version is correct, whereas it looks pretty in Firefox but the subsetted version has all its characters overlapping

[15:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: http://intertwingly.net/tmp/logo3.svg

[15:15:00.0000] <annevk>
k

[15:15:01.0000] <annevk>
will still do it "tomorrow" though

[15:15:02.0000] <annevk>
/me is tired

[15:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
that's ok

[15:16:01.0000] <annevk>
good :)

[15:16:02.0000] <zcorpan>
:)

[15:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Aha, Firefox is happy when I fix the hdmx table

[15:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
which Opera presumably ignores

[15:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: also, you might want to add AddType font/ttf .ttf

[15:23:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, is anyone fixing the media type issue then?

[15:23:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: dunno

[15:24:00.0000] <annevk>
/me tried, didn't get enough support and got distracted

[15:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
currently it's text/plain

[15:25:01.0000] <annevk>
I mean fixing the media type issue in browsers

[15:26:00.0000] <annevk>
I know it's broken on my server, I didn't specify anything at all

[15:27:00.0000] <annevk>
I wonder why Larry moved the Origin thread from WebApps to the HTML WG :/

[15:27:01.0000] <annevk>
I also wonder why he claims that the W3C cannot introduce new headers and protocols, they can

[15:31:00.0000] <annevk>
lol http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/reminder-opera

[15:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is there a way to disable spellchecking in <p contenteditable> in Firefox and Opera?

[15:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
(The red underlines are ugly)

[15:36:02.0000] <annevk>
spellcheck="no" in Firefox?

[15:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Doesn't seem to work

[15:37:01.0000] <annevk>
oh, I thought they had that implemented

[15:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe only on form fields?

[15:38:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe :)

[15:38:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: iirc, the spellcheck implementation predated contenteditable in firefox

[15:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is using the latest FF3.1 nightly

[15:44:00.0000] <roc_>
spellcheck should work with contenteditable I thought

[15:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
I must be doing something stupid because I still get wavey red lines

[15:48:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe it's spellcheck="false" ?

[15:48:01.0000] <annevk>
/me isn't sure about the exact syntax

[15:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
I tried that too

[15:48:03.0000] <annevk>
ah, it's "off"

[15:49:00.0000] <annevk>
just like autocomplete I suppose

[15:50:00.0000] <annevk>
did Microsoft invent both autocomplete and contenteditable?

[15:50:01.0000] <roc_>
I think we must have broken it somehow

[15:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
data:text/html,<p contenteditable spellcheck="off">Slartibartfast

[15:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
underlines in red in FF

[15:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
and also in Opera 10 once I click on the text

[15:51:03.0000] <roc_>
yeah, something's busted


2009-01-20
[16:30:00.0000] <roc_>
hmm

[16:30:01.0000] <roc_>
I am the stupidest person in the world

[16:31:00.0000] <roc>
spellcheck="true" does not turn off spellcheck in Firefox trunk

[16:31:01.0000] <roc>
spellcheck="false" does

[16:31:02.0000] <roc>
(and it works with contenteditable)

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me receives spam with the subject line "Make a living on Google"

[16:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think i have that covered

[16:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: data:text/html,<p contenteditable spellcheck="false">Slartibartfast still gives me a wavey red line

[16:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
...at least in Gecko/20090119 Shiretoko/3.1b3pre

[16:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i think it's reasonable to assume that copy and paste is part of the problem statement, because that's a user-facing interface.

[16:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: "i want to expose a way to have the user copy content from one document, paste it into my text editor, and have my text editor automatically generate the bibliographic entry" seems like a reasonable request.

[16:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, that one is a copy and paste issue. But the other two about getting contact information from a web page into an address book, and getting an email from webmail into a native client, aren't copy and paste issues

[16:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
at least, they don't have to be

[16:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[16:48:00.0000] <roc>
Philip`: OK, it looks like spellcheck only works on "body" to control contenteditable spellchecking for the entire document :-(

[17:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://fonts.philip.html5.org/

[17:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Seems to work in at least FF3.1 and Opera 10

[17:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
(It's pretty limited and buggy, but at least it can handle simple ASCII characters for a few fonts)

[17:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: i'm confused. what text about 'origin' are we discussing removing anyway?

[17:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought the whole problem was that there was no definition and we needed an ID for one

[17:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, based on the Origin thread, I assumed there was a specific section about Origin that was being moved out of the spec and into an ID. Is that not the case?

[17:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps I should look at the spec...

[17:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know

[17:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
nobody seems to have said what they are discussing

[17:29:04.0000] <Lachy>
wouldn't it be section 5.3 or 5.3.1?

[17:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, maybe not

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's about scripting

[17:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
not the http header

[17:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen said here that he'd discussed it with you http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0210.html

[17:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
I see. The spec mentions XXX-Origin header in several places throughout the spec. But there doesn't seem to be anywhere that actually defines it. Now I'm confused too

[17:35:00.0000] <abarth>
politics makes my head hurt :(

[21:12:00.0000] <heycam>
annevk, http://twitter.com/waka/status/1132138169

[23:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish webkit had an upload progress bar

[00:11:00.0000] <annevk>
roc, also note that the spec says the values should be "on" and "off"...

[00:12:00.0000] <annevk>
roc, so maybe Chrome and Gecko do different things here?

[00:12:01.0000] <roc>
which spec? Ian's old spec doesn't

[00:12:02.0000] <roc>
http://www.damowmow.com/playground/spellcheck.txt

[00:14:00.0000] <annevk>
ah, but an even older one does: http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2006-June/006762.html

/me wonders if @color-profile is implemented

[00:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2009/01/19/where-memes-go-to-die/ (#7)

[00:25:00.0000] <deane>
annevk: you may already have seen this, but: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2009Jan/0075.html http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2009Jan/0077.html

[00:28:00.0000] <annevk>
I hadn't

[00:28:01.0000] <annevk>
/me is not following public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf

[00:29:00.0000] <annevk>
/me thinks the voting Ian referred to would be in the HTMLWG, not the WHATWG

[00:48:00.0000] <deane>
yeah, Manu has it wrong, in fact the whole RDFa issue is a result of misinformation and misunderstandings, we wouldn't have this issue of RDFa deployment if the W3C admited publicly that only a handfull of people are using XHTML

[00:56:00.0000] <deane>
...That way we wouldn't end up with specs that can't be implemented.

[01:01:00.0000] <annevk>
no big deal

[01:03:00.0000] <deane>
It's no big deal as long as everyone knows that HTML5 doesn't have an obligation to suport all these unimplementable specs

[01:03:01.0000] <annevk>
well, there is disagreement over that

[01:04:00.0000] <annevk>
and I think we've yet to establish who is right

[01:08:00.0000] <danbri>
deane, which spec re rdfa are you thinking is unimplementable?

[01:10:00.0000] <deane>
danbri: http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/

[01:12:00.0000] <danbri>
that's 'rdfa in xhtml'; nobody is asking HTML5 to be XML-only. So I think this leaves the door open for figuring out which bits of it could be re-built on top of html5 without too much trauma

[01:12:01.0000] <danbri>
eg. a profile without using curies 

[01:13:00.0000] <deane>
how can you implement a spec that is XHTML only, when there's only about one hundred people in the world using XHTML

[01:14:00.0000] <danbri>
this conversation isn't feeling very collaborative. i'm trying to talk to you about finding a version of that design which *is* implementable in html5...

[01:15:00.0000] <deane>
if you have to alter the spec to be usable in text/html, then the whole should be altered since the web is text/html, therefore the spec has no value

[01:16:00.0000] <danbri>
"if ... then .... therefore ...."

[01:16:01.0000] <danbri>
/me thinks

[01:16:02.0000] <danbri>
nope, you've lost me.

[01:16:03.0000] <danbri>
one more time?

[01:16:04.0000] <deane>
start again from scratch

[01:16:05.0000] <danbri>
i spent some time yesterday talking with henri, and looking at existing rdfa parser behaviour

[01:17:00.0000] <deane>
specs need to be written from scratch to suit text/html

[01:17:01.0000] <danbri>
idea was to find something that was close to what those parsers expect (i tested 6); and close to what could be done in html5 with no ugliness

[01:18:00.0000] <deane>
sure, so we are really starting from scratch then, right?

[01:18:01.0000] <danbri>
the rdfa spec tries to be a design that can be bound to specific concrete carrier languages (svg, atom, xhtml, ...) 

[01:19:00.0000] <danbri>
binding to a non-xml language is more of a stretch; since you need to invent or avoid having a ns abbreviation mechanism

[01:19:01.0000] <danbri>
most of the dicussion to date has been around this re-inventing a ns prefixing mechanism

[01:19:02.0000] <danbri>
the idea we explored yesterday was about avoiding one by always using full URIs

[01:20:00.0000] <danbri>
ie. a compromise that might not be what either 'side' wants but which can still be useful

[01:21:00.0000] <deane>
I can understand that, but, not many people are using xhtml, most people using svg in the future will be using it in text/html which has no support for namespaces

[01:23:00.0000] <deane>
...and people using xhtml in the future will be using xhtml5, not xhtml1, so unfortunately that spec we mentioned has no real value

[01:23:01.0000] <danbri>
so would you agree it was useful for me to spend my yesterday trying out rdfa tool support for a namespaces-free profile of rdfa?

[01:23:02.0000] <deane>
I think that's a step forward

[01:24:00.0000] <danbri>
notes are in http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/2009/rdfa/tests/readme.txt if you're interested

[01:24:01.0000] <danbri>
unfortunately it seems the parsers mostly work on the html5 no-ns version, but so long as they find a magic hack,  xmlns:http="http:"

[01:25:00.0000] <danbri>
henri said it's easier to make the validator tolerate this than to have it check real use of xml namespaces; but i hope we can approach from the other side too, and have rdf parsers not look for it

[01:26:00.0000] <danbri>
this would give a copy-and-paste-friendly profile of rdfa: subsets which, with some care, could be copy/pasted between html5 and xhtml5/atom/svg docs

[01:26:01.0000] <danbri>
(obviously you'd need to stick to pretty bland markup to avoid tripping up on other things, but that's life)

[01:30:00.0000] <deane>
has the RDFa crowd got any demo pages showing what they think RDFa could look like in a html5 page? I don't understand what the need is for namespaces or pseudo non xml namespaces

[01:33:00.0000] <deane>
actually, I don't think I've seen a concrete proposal put forward from the RDFa guys, I saw something about adding six attributes

[01:34:00.0000] <danbri>
see t5 and t6 examples in  http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/2009/rdfa/tests/ 

[01:34:01.0000] <danbri>
those are what i was testing parsers with; one has xhtml boilerplate, the other htm5

[01:35:00.0000] <danbri>
and http://svn.foaf-project.org/foaftown/2009/rdfa/tests/g2.html is one that breaks henri's current validation demo for html5+rdfa-minus-curies, cos it uses rev=

[01:36:00.0000] <danbri>
hi MikeSmith

[01:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me encounters a bug in the Font::TTF library

[01:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
which is surprising because I thought it'd take much less than a day to find one

[01:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me encounters a second bug in the Font::TTF library

[01:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's not going so well now :-(

[01:52:00.0000] <annevk>
have you tried error handling yet?

[01:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
What kind of error handling?

[01:54:01.0000] <annevk>
dunno, wrong tables, wrong set of bytes, etc.

[01:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
No - I'm just assuming the input is an approximately correct font

[01:57:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe I don't understand what you're doing

[02:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm doing http://fonts.philip.html5.org/

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk>
ah, cool

[02:01:01.0000] <annevk>
I thought you were testing font interpreters

[02:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's just a side-effect of trying to view fonts in browsers

[02:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Trying a multi-byte character doesn't work well.

[02:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I just want ASCII to work first :-)

[02:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
Currently I just want to be able to load a particular font and save it again, without it mysteriously stopping working in Firefox even though I can't see any non-trivial differences in the files

[02:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, turns out that Firefox (or whatever font library it uses on Linux) is sensitive to the ordering of the tables, which is probably violating the TTF spec

[02:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
...or maybe it isn't?

[02:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'm confused :-(

[02:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, yes, I was confused

[02:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me curses checksums that he forgot to update

[02:37:00.0000] <roc>
we use Freetype and Pango on Linux

[02:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
They seem to be working fine, and it's just my code that's being stupid

[03:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me decides to adopt a policy of not supporting fonts with CFF outlines, because he's lazy and doesn't care enough

[03:25:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, oops, duh

[03:26:00.0000] <annevk>
/me should do something simple, like breaking his blog in all but beta browsers, while sick

[03:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You could make your blog all red and add lots of "comrade".

[03:28:00.0000] <annevk>
http://barslecht.nl/weblog/

[03:28:01.0000] <annevk>
en ook de homepage http://barslecht.nl/

[03:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: bummer. Wouldn't it be nice to support the Computer Modern Unicode family, which makes it possible to get the beloved LaTeX look on the Web

[03:34:00.0000] <jcranmer>
"[Put "almost" in front of most words in the following.]

[03:34:01.0000] <jcranmer>
"

[03:34:02.0000] <jcranmer>
okay...

[03:34:03.0000] <jcranmer>
The almost consistent almost DOM almost criteria is almost necessary but almost not almost not almost sufficient.

[03:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
almost things like xml:lang take more than almost effort to support

[03:39:00.0000] <annevk>
but that would not have been the case if we could have put it in the XML namespace, right?

[03:41:00.0000] <annevk>
so many things are slightly broken because of design decision made in the past; makes me wonder what our mistakes are

[03:42:00.0000] <annevk>
according to olliej <canvas> should have had a Path object from the beginning, anything else?

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: when XML was specced, there were markup languages with attribute lang

[03:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and id

[03:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so the right way would have been to reserve the names id and lang in XML if cross-vocabulary ids and langs were considered important

[03:49:03.0000] <annevk>
oh yeah, no doubt they made lots of mistakes when speccing XML

[03:50:00.0000] <annevk>
but I'm sort of past the idea of getting that fixed (apart from maybe xml:id)

[03:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
one of the mistakes being adding Namespaces to the XML layer instead of making it an RDF layer problem

[03:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if the damage done to XML is any indication, we should avoid adding CURIEs to HTML

[03:51:01.0000] <annevk>
(reasonable people would say here: I disagree)

[03:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
SVG and MathML should get rid of xml:id, in my opinion

[03:51:03.0000] <hsivonen>
both have pre-existing id that works well enough

[03:52:00.0000] <annevk>
that would be a start, yes

[03:52:01.0000] <annevk>
as for CURIEs, they seem to hard to author to me

[03:52:02.0000] <annevk>
but I can also see that having to register short names to be used as prefix is a non-starter for many RDF folks

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
though maybe there is some middle way

[03:53:01.0000] <annevk>
where you either use a predefined prefix or just use the full URI

[03:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
one of the fundamental problem that RDF-the-model has is that it uses URIs as identifiers and URIs are too long

[03:53:03.0000] <annevk>
that would at least survive under copy & paste

[03:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so RDF has had various syntaxes created for it

[03:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and the syntaxes (except N-Triples, yay for N-Triples) try to somehow make the length of the URIs disappear

[03:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but instead of making things simpler and shorter, the RDF serializations always create more cruft and complication when they try to make URIs shorter

[03:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so in time each serialization is declared as sucky, a new one is created and around we go again

[03:56:00.0000] <annevk>
has it been established that the URL length is the main issue with the serializations?

[03:56:01.0000] <annevk>
or the abbreviation mechanism

[03:57:00.0000] <annevk>
or are there other reasons why e.g. one might not like RDF/XML?

[03:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: RDF serializations in practice if they abbreviate URIs want to have more than one URI prefix in scope, so just declaring a base won't work

[03:59:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, but they allow for multiple abbreviations

[03:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: and, yes, if you consider how other serializations of the same family differ from N-Triples, one of the main things they tend to address is URI length

[03:59:02.0000] <annevk>
ok

[03:59:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I mean, if you have an abbreviation mechanism, you can't use the one that works for HTML (i.e. base plus relative)

[04:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
without being able point to one of many active bases

[04:01:00.0000] <annevk>
"Furthermore, experience in the wild (notably with SVG) shows that as soon as you have two versions a non-negligible subset of all documents start being labelled with the wrong version, meaning you now have a lot of useless metadata on your hands."

[04:01:01.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders when berjon will let go of the angle brackets :)

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, yeah, we can address that though, e.g. give <html> a prefix attribute or some such

[04:02:01.0000] <annevk>
but the main problem then is copy & paste

[04:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: nope, there are more problems left even in that case: http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-January/018283.html

[04:06:00.0000] <annevk>
I don't think "Negative savings in syntax length when I given prefix is only used a couple of times in a file." is correct

[04:06:01.0000] <annevk>
as typically those URLs are long

[04:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok, s/couple of times/once/

[04:07:00.0000] <annevk>
prefix="x:{url}" is 10 characters plus 2 characters each time you use it

[04:07:01.0000] <annevk>
well ok :)

[04:08:00.0000] <annevk>
but yeah, those concerns seem valid, although using registered prefixes instead requires maintaining a massive table of RDF vocabularies

[04:08:01.0000] <annevk>
but I'm not sure if you suggested something like that

[04:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Computer Modern would indeed be nice; if I don't decide this project is a waste of time that nobody cares about and give up on it, I suppose CFF support would be a worthwhile thing to add in the future

[04:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has no idea if "CFF" is the right term to use, but that's the name of the OpenType table that the offending fonts store glyph data in

[04:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: is it a problem to have a massive table of rdf vocabularies?

[04:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
we have a massive table of entities

[04:43:02.0000] <annevk>
shepazu, "<shepazu> definitely wrt URLs" HTML5 does not ignore IETF standards for URIs or IRIs, it just defines pre-processing when they are encountered within HTML attributes. According to e.g. Larry that is acceptable

[04:44:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, hsivonen e-mail points it out as something that would be annoying, I don't feel strongly either way

[04:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: Entities aren't open-ended. there's a new RDF vocabulary born every minute

[04:45:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ok

[04:48:00.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ietf-w3c/2009Jan/0003.html has a long discussion on HTML5 by danc, shepazu, some IETF folks, etc.

[05:08:00.0000] <takkaria>
and people want RDFa because of decentralised extensibility

[05:09:00.0000] <takkaria>
make a table of URLs and no-one will want it anymore. :)

[05:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh no, I forgot about ligatures :-(

[05:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
takkaria: Indeed. It seems like you could have a canonical table and allow people to use short prefixes from the table if they want. ALthough I guess there are problems if you want to append to the table and clients need to update

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
like I said, all attempts to hide the length of URIs lead to more complexity

[05:30:00.0000] <rubys>
hsivonen: are you up for helping me think through a thought experiment on this subject?  I'm not sure what the outcome is, but it might be worth exploring...

[05:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rubys: perhaps later this week, not today or tomorrow

[05:32:00.0000] <rubys>
ok

[05:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Another "we should force implementors to implement what we want" post

[05:48:00.0000] <takkaria>
my brother made an amusing comment on identifying everything with URIs

[05:49:00.0000] <takkaria>
"makes me understand why we don't identify ourselves with genealogies anymore"

[05:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Did people ever identify themselves with genealogies, other than in Tolkien?

[05:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Vikings

[05:51:01.0000] <takkaria>
the bible has a fair bit of it too

[05:51:02.0000] <takkaria>
anyway, I thought it was worth sharing, regarldess of factual accuracy. :)

[05:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
If only you had shared in in the form of an RDF triple we could have merged it with other humerous remarks

[05:55:00.0000] <takkaria>
jokes are not well representable in RDF, sadly

[05:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I propose using http://irc.whatwg.org/2009/01/20/13/55/52/0 to denote the statement

[05:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
I once heard a humerous remark from my fibula

[05:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
This? http://dashiva.net/img/humerus.jpg

[06:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: s/with and height/width and height/ (in the img section)

[06:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
If jokes can't be represented in RDF, how will the film "Short Circuit" ever become reality? Clearly we need a solution for the use case of making friends with robots

[06:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Surely robots will find RDF itself funny enough :P

[06:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: is http://www.libpr0n.com/tests/frames/004/004.html invalid? (i get the same result in opera, firefox, ie8 and safari)

[06:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh no. The doctype thread is degrading into a versioning debate again :-(

[06:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me adds that to my list of threads to not respond

[07:02:00.0000] <annevk>
you can probably use the http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/emotion/XGR-emotionml/ vocabulary to express humor in RDF

[07:05:00.0000] <annevk>
brucel suggested Mr Last Week might be Hixie gone schizophrenic, as in Fight Club :p

[07:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me already suggested My Last Week was in fact Hixie

[07:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me fixes a bug that probably caused gsnedders to see multi-byte characters not working

[07:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Characters like â are typically stored as composite glyphs, so I need to recurse into those to work out which component glyphs need to be included too, and then renumber them all)

[07:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
(This all seems like a bit of a pain really)

[07:10:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe that's why nobody has done it yet ;)

[07:12:00.0000] <annevk>
meanwhile Last Week has a "follow your leader" post http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2009/01/stark-choice-for-html5-and-future-of.html :p

[07:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
But it's not a lot of pain, so someone else should have already spent a few days doing the same kind of thing

[07:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
(but not that I can find anywhere)

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and anyway it's more fun to rewrite it)

[07:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds that Opera does really crazy things, like using entirely the wrong font for some paragraphs

[07:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems to pretty much ignore the font-family <-> src mapping in the CSS, and just make up its own mapping

[07:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, file some bugs

[07:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, how annoying, it works correctly if I upload the fonts somewhere

[07:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, maybe it's just a stale cache

[07:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, yes, that was it

oh, heh, I'm on the list for who could be the biggest smeghead

humm http://www.whitehouse.gov/ is xhtml served as text/html

[09:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Because serving XHTML as text/html is really helpful when you want to move to real XHTML!

[09:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
All you need is to wait until IE supports XHTML, and then flip your web server's big red switch labelled "application/xhtml+xml", and the world will become many times zazzier than before!

My multipage splitter script has an instance of curl which has been attempting to downloading the spec for 21 days and 19 hours

[10:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I was guessing that was the cause of the first error

ewwww.... *all* of the ids are the same.

[10:31:03.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: No, but it's dumped a hundred megabytes of progress bar into my log file

[10:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
rubys: At least it means it's easier to work around, having duplicate IDs in the feed at the same time

[10:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yay :\

If I use a combining diacritic in a line of text that uses @font-face, then Safari 3.1 scrunches up all the characters from the whole line on top of each other

but only when I run from a local web server, not when I upload it to somewhere else :-/

[11:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
(even after I empty my cache)

[11:27:03.0000] <Dashiva>
charset thing?

[11:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[11:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oops

[11:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
Probably because it's being served as text/plain on the remote server

[11:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, that's not it, the font is now application/octet-stream on both

[11:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, right, I'm still just being an idiot

[11:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
since the version on the remote web server pointed to a non-existent URL for the font

[11:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Could someone say what http://philip.html5.org/tests/font/combining-chars.html looks like in a recent Safari on OS X?

ooks fine to me

[11:42:01.0000] <takkaria>
in Safari 3.2.1

[11:42:02.0000] <takkaria>
same text on different lines in different fonts

[11:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Okay, thanks

I get http://philip.html5.org/tests/font/combining-chars-safari-win.png

[11:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
which is suboptimal from a readability perspective

[11:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But can you live with it?

[11:47:01.0000] <rubys>
/me chuckles

[11:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
I tend not to use many combining diacritics in my daily writing, so I suppose it's not *that* much of a problem

[11:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmph, I tried replacing the offending characters in my test page with the text "(Safari sucks)", and it turns out that one of my test fonts implements ')' as an upside-down '(', which reveals that my font subsetter has another bug and breaks the '(' :-(

[11:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[11:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
...breaks the ')' :-(

[11:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
...except in Opera, which doesn't use the font's glyphs for either '(' or ')'

[11:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
...Oh, sorry, that's just it caching too much again

roc: first char. is punctuation, so I'd get that matching the first two chars. fun.

[12:08:01.0000] <roc>
Then, I guess, no

[12:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The only vaguely possible suggestion I've got involves XSLT. Yay.

[12:11:00.0000] <roc>
that's not CSS

[12:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, it isn't.

[12:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I also don't want to learn XSLT for this.

[12:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Now I can convert my subsetted fonts into EOT so they work in IE

[12:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
which I suppose is a good thing, even if EOT is evil, because otherwise nobody will use these fonts when they don't work in IE

[14:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
there's something wrong with a favicon when its weirdness makes it to the BBC News front page: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7839744.stm

[14:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Seeing the last entry on that page ("I wanted to show someone using their hands to open the BBC and see inside."), I guess they didn't learn from http://www.flickr.com/photos/qwghlm/529967993/

[14:28:00.0000] <jruderman>
heh, BBC itself has a terrible favicon

[15:14:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
what's the correct markup to include a phone number?

[15:14:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i imagine it goes into an address element

[15:14:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
should i wrap the number itself in a tag?

[15:16:00.0000] <webben>
doodlewarrior: is the phone number contact information for the author of the page (or at least that distinctive section of the page?)

[15:16:01.0000] <webben>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-address-element

[15:16:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
yes

[15:16:03.0000] <doodlewarrior>
its a feedback viewer

[15:17:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
theres a header element containing info about the user who submitted the feedback

[15:17:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
followed by his content

[15:17:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i think i found what i need

[15:17:03.0000] <doodlewarrior>
href='tel:5551212'

[15:17:04.0000] <webben>
there's no special markup for phone numbers specifically afaik although I would note http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.123 and http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard

[15:18:00.0000] <webben>
hmm, does anything implement tel: ?

[15:18:01.0000] <webben>
Skype?

[15:18:02.0000] <tantek>
in practice phone numbers are nearly always present as part of contact info, and thus should be marked up with hCard as noted.

[15:19:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
mobile phones, for one

[15:20:00.0000] <webben>
point

[15:20:01.0000] <webben>
(though I think mobile phones probably try to make phone-number-like strings phoneable)

[15:20:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
generally yes

[15:20:03.0000] <doodlewarrior>
but as long as im marking it up i might as well do it properly

[15:21:00.0000] <webben>
true

[15:21:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
http://developer.apple.com/webapps/designingcontent.php

[15:21:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
Integrate with Phone, Mail, Maps, and YouTube

[15:21:03.0000] <doodlewarrior>
symbian and winmo also support it

[15:22:00.0000] <webben>
interesting

[15:22:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
thx

[15:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me puts his gloves back on and begins working on html5 again

[15:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
right

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
how does navigating to a javascript: URI that returns a string affect the baseURI of the frame?

[15:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wishes he'd get as many replies to technical questions like this as he does to questions about the introduction section

[15:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe we should have a system where you have to contibute technical feedback before you're allowed to have an opinion on simpler stuff

[15:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
that would reduce the bikeshedding...

[15:47:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
Hixie: i'm not the most advanced js user, so take this all with salt

[15:48:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
but i was under the impression that a javascript:my_function() link would be a prettier way to do onclick='my_function'

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean something like http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/uri/javascript/003.html

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
where an iframe has its location set to a javascript: URL that returns a string

[15:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
opera and firefox seem to agree that the base uri is the base uri of the script that was evaluated

[15:50:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
you are officially deeper into JS than i

[15:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
hehe

[15:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
no worries

[15:51:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
this is a nit

[15:51:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
but i was just looking at the address record

[15:51:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
in the example <ADDRESS> is capped

[15:52:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
isn't the current preferred styling for tags lowercase?

[15:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
preferred by whom?

[15:52:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
fair point

[15:53:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
but a general styling consensus

[15:53:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
the same way that in python this_var is prefered to thisVar

[15:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
as far as the spec cares, it makes no difference

[15:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
lowercase is the case used in xhtml

[15:53:04.0000] <doodlewarrior>
thanks for clarifying :)

[15:53:05.0000] <doodlewarrior>
and for kicking ass on the new spec

[15:53:06.0000] <Hixie>
but other than that it doesn't really matter

[15:53:07.0000] <Hixie>
(uppercase is the case used by the DOM)

[15:53:08.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i've been writing a new app in html 5

[15:53:09.0000] <Hixie>
yeah?

[15:54:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
yeah

[15:54:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
very much in dev

[15:54:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
but imaregular.com

[15:55:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
the data- property is very much my friend

[15:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[15:56:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
:)

[15:56:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
not really relevant, just figured id share

[15:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
always good to hear about people liking html5 :-)

[15:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
especially these days, where a lot of hte feedback is from groups who have been spurned by html5 :-)

[15:57:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
as a matter of fact. . .

[15:58:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
regarding boolean attributes

[15:58:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
it would be nice if their was a caveat in the spec that value='true' and value='false' are not valid

[15:58:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
since the term boolean is defined to be true/false in so many other web languages


2009-01-21
[16:00:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
that broke my validation for a little while.  it boggled my mind that value='value' was true and a complete omission was false

[16:01:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
second (and final so far) feedback:

[16:01:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
it would be really sweet if you could get the value of a radio group by name in javascript

[16:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've added a note for the boolean attributes

[16:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
i agree about the radio buttons

[16:02:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
thanks :)

[16:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose we could add a method on the object returned by HTMLFormControlCollection...

[16:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm no that wouldn't always work

[16:04:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i don't know the implementation so much as the UI

[16:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose we could add a .groupValue attribute on HTMLInputElement

[16:05:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i would expect that as myForm.myTextField returns the value of the text field, myForm.myRadioButton would return the value of the chosen element

[16:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
myForm.myRadioButton returns a NodeList of all the controls with the name "myRadioButton"

[16:06:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
ahhh

[16:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
(which might not even be the same as the list of radio buttons in that group)

[16:06:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
isn't a group defined by having a similar name?

[16:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but "similar" for radio button grouping and for NodeList returning is defined differently

[16:07:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i see

[16:07:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
so if you add groupValue, then it would be myForm.myRadio[0].groupValue?

[16:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
which looks silly, i admit

[16:08:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
it's better than nothing

[16:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:08:04.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i feel for you though

[16:08:05.0000] <doodlewarrior>
backwards compatibility is a bitch when you're trying to standardize

[16:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:09:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
it would be really nice to iron out all of the inconsistencies, like bool='false' being invalid or a myForm.text returning something different than myForm.radio

[16:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
myForm.text returns a NodeList if there are multiple controls with the name text too

[16:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
but yeah

[16:10:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
really, myForm.text ought to always return a NodeList

[16:10:03.0000] <doodlewarrior>
it would make the DOM slightly shittier

[16:10:04.0000] <doodlewarrior>
but more predictable

[16:10:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well

[16:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
that boat sailed decades ago

[16:11:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i know it

[16:12:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
there needs to be a backwards-incompatible HTML upgrade

[16:12:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
its probably to late to have it be HTML5, but maybe HTML6

[16:12:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
fix all the bullshit that people are afraid to change because of backwards incompatibility

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
we'll never be able to do that

[16:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Would it be wrong to suggest XHTML2 here? :)

[16:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
the content that we need to be compatible with today isn't going to go away tomorrow

[16:13:03.0000] <doodlewarrior>
exactly

[16:13:04.0000] <doodlewarrior>
that's what DOCTYPE is for

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
browsers aren't going to add yet another processing mode

[16:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
microsoft tried that with ie8

[16:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
and they're already regretting it as far as i can tell

[16:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
they haven't even shipped it yet

[16:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
opera, mozilla, and safari devs have all told me point blank that there's zero chance they'll ever want to do that

[16:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
we already have four modes

[16:14:06.0000] <Hixie>
which they consider to be plenty

[16:14:07.0000] <Hixie>
(quirks, limited quirks, no quirks, and xml)

[16:15:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
wow

[16:15:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Before I can even ask what the fourth was...

[16:17:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
so Hixie, do you imagine we'll be tiptoeing around things that are broken in HTML indefinitely?

[16:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
until something replaces html entirely, yes

[16:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. xhtml2

[16:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
though i doubt xhtml2 is radical enough to be the one to replace html

[16:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Something json-based

[16:18:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Angle brackets are out

[16:18:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
so if the browsers refuse to add a processing mode to iron out the kinks in HTML

[16:19:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
why would they even start from 0 on a new language entirely?

[16:19:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
*ever

[16:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
they probably wouldn't

[16:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
they'll probably be replaced by some newcomer

[16:19:04.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Suggest XHTML2 where?

[16:19:05.0000] <doodlewarrior>
so HTML will be broken until the entire web is replaced?

[16:19:06.0000] <doodlewarrior>
in your estimation

[16:19:07.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: <doodlewarrior> fix all the bullshit that people are afraid to change because of backwards incompatibility

[16:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
doodlewarrior: unless someone can work out a way to upgrade all the old unmaintained content in one go, yes, probably

[16:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Oh, I wasn't reading the context :-p

[16:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Am I an expert in making wrong suggestions, or something? :-)

[16:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
doodlewarrior: for some meaning of the word "broken" anyway

[16:20:04.0000] <doodlewarrior>
broken being things that are inconsistent or unintuitive

[16:21:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
adding tags and properties is one thing

[16:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
doodlewarrior: do you know much about the Win32 API?

[16:21:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
but overhauling them is another

[16:21:03.0000] <doodlewarrior>
no

[16:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[16:21:05.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i do mostly flash

[16:21:06.0000] <doodlewarrior>
some django/javascript

[16:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was going to illustrate with the Win32 API, or the Unix API for that matter, that pretty much every successful long-lived platform so far has been inconsistent or unintuitive

[16:22:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
flash spoils me.  one language - a cleaned up version of javascript, with a built in display list

[16:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
successful platforms pick up cruft over the years

[16:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
from all the people working on them

[16:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
with different ideals, different motivations, different visions

[16:22:05.0000] <doodlewarrior>
my room does too, but i clean it when that happens ;-)

[16:22:06.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i certainly understand why it happens

[16:22:07.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Wasn't it you who said something about XHTML2 being the default response whenever someone made a silly request?

[16:22:08.0000] <Hixie>
imagine if your room was the size of a city, and there were lots of blind people who knew where all the junk was

[16:23:00.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i just happen to be a UI designer/entrepreneur

[16:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
you couldn't clean it any more :-)

[16:23:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
so i constantly think of 'how can this be fixed'

[16:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me . o O ( ok everyone except Firefox seems to agree that the base URL is the same as the url of the frame before it was replaced )

[16:23:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Don't fix it, make an alternative that's so awesome everyone stops using the old way

[16:23:05.0000] <Hixie>
doodlewarrior: well if you can think of a way, do let us know :-)

[16:23:06.0000] <Dashiva>
Then you can let the old way fade into obscurity and remove it when you think no one cares anymore

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's what will eventually happen, as i said above

[16:24:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
Dashiva: i agree

[16:24:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i figured it could be an iteration on HTML though

[16:24:03.0000] <Dashiva>
But that's probably on a time scale of decades

[16:24:04.0000] <doodlewarrior>
a real standards mode

[16:24:05.0000] <doodlewarrior>
but we've established that won't happen

[16:24:06.0000] <Dashiva>
No one's preventing you from only using a subset of HTML5

[16:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You could form the HTML5 Samurai or somesuch :)

[16:25:01.0000] <doodlewarrior>
hahaha

[16:25:02.0000] <doodlewarrior>
ill leave that to others

[16:25:03.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i have other parts of the world to change :-p

[16:25:04.0000] <doodlewarrior>
speaking of which, i need to get back to that

[16:25:05.0000] <doodlewarrior>
i'll be at the google appengine meeting in palo alto tonight if anyone wants to say hi

[16:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: I don't remember saying something about that

[16:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: though I say a lot of things that I immediately forget, so that's not saying much

[16:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Would an HTML5 Samurai have to commit seppuku if they noticed themselves thinking that actually maybe XML isn't that bad after all?

[16:45:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, ping

[16:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: pong

[16:52:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, would be great if you could have a looksee at the onerror thread i posted to whatwg. We're still a few weeks out from shipping, and I doubt that any comments you have are major, so there's still time to fix things. Just prefer not to get past that point

[16:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure, will do that next

[16:53:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, other than that i think we're either not implementing an API (such as location or shared workers) or follow the spec

[16:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[16:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: was there every a decision made in the svgwg about http://www.w3.org/mid/48B26024.8090403⊙wo ?

[16:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: the HTML5 Samurai would need to commit seppuku after their lord was executed and they had extracted revenge from all those responsible

[16:59:01.0000] <jcranmer>
せぷく (and yes, I'm forgetting the tsuku-thing or whatever it's called)

[16:59:02.0000] <sicking>
/me needs more fonts on his system

[17:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
IRC needs embeddable TTF fonts

[17:00:01.0000] <sicking>
@font-face ftw!

[17:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: you still there?

[17:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: re your first point, i don't understand. the onerror on the worker global scope is exactly the same as window.onerror, including the three parameters.

[17:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: the onerror on the Worker object is the one that involves the event.

[17:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can do your second request easily though

[17:11:00.0000] <roc>
Philip`: that would be easy to implement in Chatzilla!

[17:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me pokes sicking 

[17:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2009/01/bonnie-prince-cheesie.html

[17:21:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, pong

[17:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: see above

[17:24:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, oh?

[17:26:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, interface WorkerGlobalScope { ... attribute EventListener onerror;

[17:26:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, that's not right then

[17:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
its the same as on Window

[17:26:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, well, it's wrong there too then :)

[17:27:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, "Must be invoked whenever an error event is targeted at or bubbles through the element" is also wrong, there is no element and no event

[17:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm

[17:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
wonder how to fix onerror then

[17:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
since it can also take an EventListener

[17:27:04.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, JS prose is all i can think of

[17:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:27:06.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, really? on window too?

[17:27:07.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: yt?

[17:27:08.0000] <heycam>
yeah..

[17:28:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, that seems very hokey

[17:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: so window.onerror is called both for 'error' events and with three arguments sometimes

[17:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: yeah... maybe we should just use the events on Worker after all

[17:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
workers, i mean

[17:28:04.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i think we should :)

[17:28:05.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: any idea how to do that in the idl? just have it be an 'any' thing?

[17:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: k, i'll do that. sorry for wasting your time trying to be compatible with Window.

[17:29:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, otherwise we have to look at how many arguments the function takes, and if it's 3 give it those, and if it's 1 give it an event

[17:29:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, heh, no problem

[17:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
well we still have the weirdness with window.onerror

[17:29:04.0000] <heycam>
so onerror is sometimes called with (Event) and sometimes with (some, thing, else) ?

[17:30:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i don't think window.onerror is anything event like on window. At least not in gecko. Maybe in safari/opera though

[17:30:01.0000] <heycam>
what about introducing an interface that has an overloaded handleEvent (one that takes Event, like EventListener, and one for the 3-arg version)?

[17:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: yeah

[17:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: oh, could do that, yeah

[17:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: ok

[17:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: thanks

[17:30:06.0000] <Hixie>
maybe make it inherit from EventListener

[17:30:07.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[17:31:01.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, I'll have to make sure that overloading like that works when you assign a plain Function

[17:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[17:31:03.0000] <heycam>
but, assume for now it does

[17:31:04.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[17:31:05.0000] <heycam>
and i'll check on it later at some point

[17:31:06.0000] <sicking>
do we need this stuff at all? Even for window though?

[17:32:00.0000] <sicking>
/me tries in opera

[17:33:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, pointer to where in the spec this three-argument thing is?

[17:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: search for "runtime error"

[17:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
or "runtime script errors"

[17:36:00.0000] <heycam>
got it

[17:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Cscript%3E%0Awindow.onerror%20%3D%20function%20%28a%2Cb%2Cc%29%20{%0A%20w%28%27onerror%3A%27%20%2B%20a%20%2B%20%27%3B%27%20%2B%20b%20%2B%20%27%3B%27%20%2B%20c%29%3B%0A}%3B%0A%3C%2Fscript%3E%0A%3Cscript%3E-%3C%2Fscript%3E%0A%3Cscript%3E%0A%20var%20x%20%3D%20document.createEvent%28%27Event%27%29%3B%0A%20x.initEvent%28%27error%27%2C%20false%2C%20false%29%3B%0A%20window.dispatchE

[17:39:01.0000] <sicking>
/me also had an 'onerror = function(a, b, c)'

[17:39:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, i think that got cut off :(

[17:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/ click "download"

[17:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
the results are in the log at the bottom

[17:40:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, no, the url you pasted me literally ends with ".dispatchE" on this side

[17:41:00.0000] <sicking>
possibly chatzilla or irc server cutting it off

[17:41:01.0000] <gavin>
server, but that doesn't change his followup instructions :)

[17:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: if you go to that url and click download, you'll see what i tried to paste

[17:42:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, oh, neat

[17:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
haven't tested IE yet

[17:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
Firefox does what I described; Webkit doesn't seem to have an onerror at all, and Opera only seems to have a the event handler.

[17:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
sicking: workers spec updated with new onerror stuff

[17:44:00.0000] <sicking>
/me ponders

[17:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok IE does the 3-argument form

[17:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
but they don't support DOM Events

[17:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i can't test the other one

[17:46:00.0000] <sicking>
right

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually the webkit problem seems to be lack of dispatchEvent() support on Window

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno what that's about

[17:48:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, however you can't set onerror to an EventListener

[17:48:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, so spec is still not correct

[17:48:02.0000] <sicking>
err

[17:48:03.0000] <sicking>
nevermind

[17:49:00.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, right, you can't set onerror to an EventListener

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
?

[17:50:01.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, how do i do the upload magic?

[17:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
click "upload"

[17:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
it'll replace whatever's in the clipboard

[17:51:00.0000] <sicking>
done

[17:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand what you are trying to show

[17:51:02.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, if I try to set onerror to an eventhandler, i would have expected to receive 2 events

[17:51:03.0000] <sicking>
Hixie, but i receive a string and an event

[17:52:00.0000] <sicking>
so    attribute EventListener onerror;    is not correct

[17:52:01.0000] <sicking>
basically onerror is a JS function

[17:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
why would you expect that?

[17:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
a JS function always implements any Callback interface

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
the number of parameters you put in the signature has no effect

[17:53:01.0000] <sicking>
right

[17:53:02.0000] <sicking>
ok, so simplified example

[17:54:00.0000] <sicking>
given the definition in the idl, i would have expected the onerror function to receive a Event object

[17:55:00.0000] <sicking>
but it receives a string

[17:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
the runtime script errors section explicitly says to just call with three arguments

[17:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
there is no event a this point

[17:55:03.0000] <sicking>
but then it's not an EventListener

[17:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's a totally unrelated callback

[17:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[17:55:06.0000] <Hixie>
it's an EventListenerOrErrorHandler

[17:55:07.0000] <Hixie>
which inherits from EventListener and also has a handleEvent() overloaded with three arguments

[17:56:00.0000] <sicking>
it's never an EventListener

[17:56:01.0000] <sicking>
So just call it ErrorHandlerCallback or some such

[17:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
it has to be an EventListener otherwise it wouldn't work with event dispatch

[17:56:03.0000] <sicking>
hmm.. actually, that's not true either i guess

[17:57:00.0000] <sicking>
right

[17:57:01.0000] <sicking>
actually

[17:57:02.0000] <sicking>
/me tries something else

[17:58:00.0000] <sicking>
ok, uploaded new example

[17:59:00.0000] <sicking>
if that was an EventListenerOrErrorHandler i would have expected the example to work

[17:59:01.0000] <sicking>
but it's really just a JS function, that we sometimes call with one parameter, and sometimes with 3

[17:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
the EventListenerOrErrorHandler interface is marked with [Callback=FunctionOnly]

[18:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
(actually i think i'll just call it ErrorHandler, EventListenerOrErrorHandler is too long)

[18:00:01.0000] <sicking>
ugh, that's really wierd

[18:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me points at the topic

[18:00:03.0000] <sicking>
an interface with two functions, but that can't be implemented by an object?

[18:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't make this up, i'm just describing what happens

[18:01:00.0000] <sicking>
well, not really

[18:01:01.0000] <sicking>
you're describing something that looks mostly the same

[18:01:02.0000] <sicking>
what it really is is just a plain JS function

[18:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
how is it distinguishable?

[18:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's not _just_ a plain JS function, since it works with DOM Events

[18:01:05.0000] <sicking>
it's possibly not, but yours is more convoluted

[18:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
and that wouldn't be compatible with other languages, either

[18:02:01.0000] <sicking>
there is an eventhandler that calls into the JS function

[18:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's just as convoluted

[18:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
except it only works in JS

[18:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually what i'm describing is pretty terse in the spec

[18:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just putting the finishing touches on it

[18:04:00.0000] <sicking>
it's way uglier than a simple onerror EventListener though

[18:04:01.0000] <sicking>
but i agree we'll have to do something like it for the window object

[18:06:00.0000] <sicking>
btw, is this updated in a draft somewhere? still looks like |attribute EventListener onerror| when i reload the webapps draft

[18:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
why would that change?

[18:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was only going to change the HTML5 draft

[18:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
though i just noticed another problem

[18:10:03.0000] <sicking>
because it's an EventListenerOrErrorHandler or ErrorHandler, no?

[18:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
not on the workers...?

[18:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
the whole point of the earlier change was to get rid of the error handler stuff

[18:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
wasn't that what you wanted?

[18:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused

[18:11:03.0000] <sicking>
sorry, i said webapps, meant html5

[18:11:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[18:11:05.0000] <sicking>
i didn't know the whatwg spec was called that too :)

[18:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are two specs. workers and html5. "webapps" and "whatwg" are working groups not specs :-P

[18:12:01.0000] <sicking>
ah :)

[18:12:02.0000] <sicking>
i guess this does make sense for the window object, though i'm not really sure if we'd be able to implement it that way

[18:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
html5 in the whatwg used to be called Web Apps 1.0, but we renabed it before the webapps wg started, iirc

[18:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
the problem i just noticed is that actually none of the so-called EventListener objects are EventListeners really

[18:12:05.0000] <sicking>
ok

[18:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
they're all functions

[18:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
that then get wrapped and the wrapper is addEventListener'ed implicitly

[18:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
the wrapper does things like handle return values

[18:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
which EventListeners don't normally have

[18:13:04.0000] <sicking>
yep

[18:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
so i think actually what i need to do (contrary to what heycam and i just discussed) is just change EventListener to something else in every IDL block

[18:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
in html5

[18:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
(and maybe workers)

[18:14:03.0000] <sicking>
hmm.. wait a minute

[18:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me waits

[18:14:05.0000] <sicking>
this doesn't happen for things other than onerror, no?

[18:14:06.0000] <Hixie>
what is "this"?

[18:15:00.0000] <sicking>
the dealing with return values and such

[18:15:01.0000] <sicking>
oh, wait

[18:15:02.0000] <sicking>
that's not true either

[18:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
it happens for everything

[18:15:04.0000] <sicking>
i guess that happens spottily

[18:15:05.0000] <sicking>
at least in gecko

[18:15:06.0000] <Hixie>
it's different for onbeforeunload, onmouseover, and onerror

[18:15:07.0000] <Hixie>
but the others all support return false; to cancel

[18:16:00.0000] <sicking>
we don't actually support that in a bunch of places

[18:17:00.0000] <sicking>
but all the places I can think of only fires non-cancelable events

[18:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
well some events can't be canceled

[18:17:02.0000] <sicking>
right

[18:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
my plan is to unify all event handling across all elements so that all elements and Window have the same set of event handler attributes

[18:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
thus making it all much simpler to implement

[18:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
no special cases (other than the three i just mentioned)

[18:18:02.0000] <sicking>
don't think that'll work on Window where you have magic undefined-by-default things

[18:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
well that might be a fourth exception

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: yeah don't worry about the earlier issue, i'll deal with it differently

[18:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
going for dinner

[19:07:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, ok

[19:24:00.0000] <hallvors>
sicking: Opera doesn't support window.onerror , I guess you figured that out by testing.

[19:25:00.0000] <sicking>
hallvors, that's about as far as I got yeah :)

[20:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hendry: you around?

[20:57:00.0000] <Papus>
hello ?

[21:05:00.0000] <Papus>
hi ?

[21:05:01.0000] <Papus>
dolske

[21:09:00.0000] <dolske>
yes?

[23:57:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: ayt? for some questions about offline cache

[23:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
here

[23:58:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: did you get my e-mail about updating obsolete caches yesterday? I was having some network troubles, so I'm not sure if it got through

[23:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i got it. added it to my pile, since iirc there was nothing urgent. i can look it up if you have a question you need a reply on right away

[00:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that the text is confusing and will make it better at some point

[00:00:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I'm discussing this with dcamp now, so it could help to have the spec updated

[00:00:02.0000] <ap>
anyway, question #2

[00:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll add it to my list for this week, ping me friday if i still haven't done anything

[00:01:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: it's not quite clear to me how documents for new master resources are associated with caches

[00:02:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: say, we're opening a new frame with a document that has a manifest URL, and there is already a cache for this URL, but the master resource is not in cache

[00:02:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: when will the document be associated to the cache?

[00:03:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: it looks like it will not be until reload with the current spec, which is weird

[00:03:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: the document will be flagged as a candidate, but candidates are only associated when an initial cache attempt finishes

[00:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
"Otherwise, invoke the application cache update process for the given manifest URL, with the browsing context being navigated, and with the Document as the new master resource."

[00:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
step 2 of the relevant variant of the application cache selection algorithm

[00:04:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: yes, that will mark the document as candidate in step 1.3 of update process

[00:05:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: but nothing more than that afaict

[00:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
the sentence that says that, in section 1.3, says what the effect is

[00:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
and links straight to the relevant step

[00:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
step 23

[00:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
"Associate any Document objects that were flagged as candidates for this manifest URL's caches with cache."

[00:06:03.0000] <ap>
Hixie: precisely, and step 23 starts with "If this is a cache attempt, then"

[00:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[00:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'm just being slow today sorry!

[00:07:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: besides, step 23 is never reached for upgrade attempts

[00:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
it isn't1?

[00:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
s/1//

[00:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
i should move that sentence to just before step 23 as far as i can tell

[00:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it happens in both cases

[00:08:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: step 6 says "If this is an upgrade attempt and the newly downloaded manifest is byte-for-byte identical to the manifest found in cache" ... "Abort the update process"

[00:08:03.0000] <ap>
Hixie: long before step 23 :)

[00:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh, yeah, i didn't think of that case

[00:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, hey, step 6 even waits for all these downloads to finish

[00:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
i just need to make sure step 23's sentence is in that list too

[00:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
can you send a mail or file a bug saying to make that sentence in step 23 happen before step 23 for upgrad attempts too, and to say to make it happen in step 6 after waiting also?

[00:10:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I'm also not sure about error and obsolete cases - will the candidate be associated with its cache in that case?

[00:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
in the obsolete case, a new cache will be created from scratch

[00:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
obsolete caches are never consulted again

[00:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
in the error case, the result should be no change to anything

[00:11:03.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I mean, if the cache is found out to be obsolete when there is a candidate

[00:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess it matters if the author then xhr's the document?

[00:12:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: we're opening a new frame, it master resource is not in cache, and it has a manifest attribute, and the manifest turns out to be 404

[00:12:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: as it works in WebKit now, the document will be associated to the obsolete cache, and it will get an "obsolete" event

[00:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah the only way that can actually matter is if the document like xhr's itself or some such right

[00:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, whether the document is actually added to the cache or not

[00:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think if we mark it obsolete we should also disable the network blocking

[00:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
and unassociate the cache

[00:13:04.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I don't see how this is related to xhr

[00:13:05.0000] <ap>
Hixie: hmm

[00:13:06.0000] <Hixie>
xhr would be the only way to get a copy of the document again

[00:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
without xhr, or <img> or some such, it doesn't matter if you add the doc to the cache or not

[00:14:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: yes, I was thinking about being associated to the cache for the purposes of blocking other loads, not just the master resource

[00:15:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: but indeed, it isn't quite clear when master resources are added to the cache either

[00:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think the obsolete case should be fixed by just disassociating from the cache

[00:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it works as if there hadn't been one

[00:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
if there's a new master doc

[00:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
(if it came from the cache, that's a different matter)

[00:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
does that make sense?

[00:19:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: currently, WebKit associates the new master resource to an existing cache earlier, before invoking the update process

[00:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
well so long as you take it out again in case of error, and so long as you don't block network loads until it's done, that's fine

[00:19:03.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I think that it is reasonable behavior - and what you said is reasonable, too

[00:20:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: what's the problem with not taking it out in case of error, and starting blocking immediately?

[00:21:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: our behavior just makes new master resources for existing caches behave as if they were already in cache

[00:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
both of those would be detectably different behavior than strict implementations of the spec

[00:21:02.0000] <ap>
Hixie: so, opening them for the first time works exactly like re-opening

[00:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh the reason why the spec does it this way is to avoid race conditions

[00:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
and for consistency between the case of going to a page for the first time whether or not it already has a manifest marked

[00:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess if there's already a cache the consistency case isn't that important

[00:23:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: right - if there is already a cache, it's more consistent to associate it right away, even if te master resource wasn't loaded from it

[00:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
makes sense

[00:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
makes the spec simpelr too

[00:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>

ap: please file a bug or send mail about the above so i don't forget to do it

[00:53:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I sent an e-mail a few minutes ago

[00:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok cool thanks

sicking: ok i checked in my fix for event handler attributes. i think it's in line with reality.

[01:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok my next task is working out how to handle the crazy wackiness around window.onload/document.onload/<body onload=""> and the like (onhashchange, onstorage, etc)

[01:37:00.0000] <annevk>
are we getting a new EventListener thingie for onX attributes?

[01:38:00.0000] <annevk>
that will affect XMLHttpRequest

[01:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
to match reality

jezus christ, to pay for a NOK 280 (= EUR 30) transaction they charged me EUR 20

Problem: Want to reuse format consumed by browsers. Solution: Change the format to be XML-like.

[01:43:01.0000] <annevk>
it's not clear to me how some TAG members make that jump

[01:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: huh? where's that from?

[01:44:01.0000] <annevk>
though admittedly, before HTML5 it is somewhat sensible as HTML was not predictable

[01:44:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, it's not a literal quote

[01:44:03.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: You have to love scandinavia, right :)

[01:44:04.0000] <annevk>
it seems to be gist of http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2009Jan/0069.html

[01:45:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, I suppose, I think my bank charged EUR 5 and the bank charged EUR 15 and I had to pay for both

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: before html5, it would have been as right (or wrong) as now, except that an additional solution would have existed: "write html5" :-P

[01:46:01.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, I suppose they are flat fees which become ridiculous when the amount of money is small

[01:46:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, :)

[01:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: a flat fee costs the same regardless of how much you're paying, so if it's ridiculous for one amount, it's ridiculous for another too.

[01:47:01.0000] <annevk>
the gist of, even

[01:48:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I just mean that If I were to pay EUR 2000, EUR 20 is fine

[01:48:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, or at least neglicable

[01:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's 20 EUR

[01:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
it the same as if you're paying EUR 10

[01:48:04.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: According to economists you are wrong

[01:48:05.0000] <Hixie>
still 20 EUR

[01:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
You should apparently always think about the absolute amount of money. It's just that most people are more disappointed if they pay $6 for something that they could have got for $1 rtahn if the numbers are $1E6, $1E6+5

[01:50:01.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, I just realized that, as I had read that link Hixie posted some time ago, but I suppose I think in relative amounts of money :)

[01:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Converting between HTML and XML in the toolchain doesn't seem like a good solution in that situation, since the conversion is lossy (in both directions) - e.g. you can't write a web crawler that parses HTML then stores it in an XML database to do a load of querying on the data, because the translation will destroy some of the data

[01:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: That's a problem called "being human" which economists have difficulty with

[01:51:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: The conclusion seems to be that storing things in an XML datatbase is not a good idea

[01:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
(at least things that may not be XML)

[01:52:01.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I never said that to convert anything, you can use XML on the infoset level...

[01:53:00.0000] <annevk>
s/that//

[01:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I would imagine any XML toolchain is very likely to serialise to XML at some point, so you've got to restrict yourself to well-formed documents

[01:55:00.0000] <annevk>
<!doctype html><title>test</title><p>test can still be used within an XML toolchain

[01:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
can't we just assume that the html5 documents will be conforming? non-conforming html documents surely aren't something we want to deal with

[01:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me ducks

[01:55:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Can we remove section 8.2 then?

[01:55:04.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Rather, the conclusion is that there is a benefit if the document format is compatible with the tools you use (without needing ugly munging in the middle), so it'd be good if all were HTML or all were XML or all were anything else

[01:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: That's why I said "e.g. you can't write a web crawler ...", because there are cases where you have no control over the input HTML but you want to make use of useful tools that already exist (and that today are mostly designed for XML)

[01:57:00.0000] <annevk>
the web crawler based on an HTML parser would surely be far more successful than one based on an XML parser

[01:57:01.0000] <annevk>
s/the/a/

[01:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: That's why I said "e.g. you can't write a web crawler that parses HTML then stores it in an XML database to do a load of querying on the data"

[01:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: OK, let's be clearer. "Storing web pages from the public internet in an XM database is not a good idea". 

[01:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
*XML

[01:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if there's a correlation between how closely search engines' parsers conform to html5 and how much market share the search engine has

[01:59:03.0000] <annevk>
and doesn't HTML5 define a way to handle those layer problems?

[01:59:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but which way does the causation go? :-)

[02:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: because you've got to use an HTML parser, but then there are other useful tools you'd like to use, and you don't want to have to deal with weird artifacts introduced by the HTML-to-well-formed-XML translation process

[02:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that's the next question :-)

[02:00:02.0000] <annevk>
obviously one based on an XML parser will be superior, because it's much faster

[02:00:03.0000] <jgraham>
Specifically I don't understand why "the value of the layering is not primarily for the browsing-only 

[02:00:04.0000] <jgraham>
scenario.  It's to give you the opportunity of using HTML documents with a 

[02:00:05.0000] <jgraham>
"

[02:00:06.0000] <jgraham>
lot of additional tools and in additional scenarios

[02:00:07.0000] <jgraham>
Because it doesn't actually do that.

[02:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/why/why he thinks/

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, why is http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tree-construction.html#coercing-an-html-dom-into-an-infoset not a solution?

[02:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: As I read it, Noah was describing an advantage of XHTML and of its use of layering on XML, which is that such a language would give you that opportunity (in the hypothetical case that people used that language)

[02:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: and it does indeed seem to be an advantage of XHTML, even if it's overshadowed by the fact that nobody uses XHTML

[02:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
xhtml has many advantages

[02:03:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I guess that could be true. But as you say, since no one uses XHTML it's really quite irrelevant

[02:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
And therefore not worthwhile to discuss in a way that suggests it is a real world consideration

[02:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: If I write something that e.g. downloads a load of random pages and then tries to count the most common attributes, using some XML database that provides nice easy-to-use efficient querying features, I don't want to be told that there's lots of attributes named "xlinkU0003Ahref" because that's just an artifact of the translation process

[02:05:00.0000] <annevk>
so you translate back when you display

[02:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Also it might irreversibly drop 'xmlns' attributes, so it's impossible to translate the results back accurately

[02:07:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah ok, so you cannot use an XML toolchain for all use cases

[02:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
The problems aren't insurmountable, they're just a bit of a pain and it'd be nicer if they weren't problems

[02:07:02.0000] <annevk>
but for the case Noah was talking about, switching to using XHTML as a storage format for Web pages, it doesn't seem worth the effort

[02:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: the tag is not about real world considerations, it's about architecture. (And I don't mean that sarcastically -- the whole point of the TAG is to discuss how things should be designed, not to deal with the realities of how things got screwed up.)

[02:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me aways

[02:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: "How things should be designed" does not seem to be a particularly useful thing to discusss when there are insurmountable problems that prevent them ever from actually being designed in that way (not to mention the fact that it tends to lead to overengineerining, poor usability considerations, etc.)

[02:10:00.0000] <annevk>
oh nice, twitter.com uses tables for layout

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wasn't making value judgements about whether or not the work of the tag was useful, i was just explaining that your statement was a non-sequitur for the tag.

[02:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I think I forgot whether I was trying to argue for any particular point, but I guess the point was that it seems better to say "HTML not being XML is indeed a problem because it makes it hard to interoperate with XML tools, but it's an unfixable problem so we'll have to reduce its impact and live with it" rather than saying "that's not a problem at all, just stick an HTML parser on your toolchain"

[02:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
but anyway I'm away :-)

[02:19:00.0000] <annevk>
I think in practice those sentences are near identical (i.e. both are true), but you're away now...

[03:26:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, shouldn't the specification define what happens when the hyperlink cannot be parsed?

[03:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
?

[03:26:02.0000] <annevk>
e.g. <a href="http://example,org/">test</a>

[03:27:00.0000] <annevk>
what happens when you "follow a hyperlink" like that

[03:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's defined

[03:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
navigation algorithm, step 4.

[03:30:00.0000] <annevk>
ah, thanks

[03:31:00.0000] <annevk>
is it correct that Firefox not treating <a href="http://a b/">test</a> as a hyperlink is considered a bug?

[03:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
per the current spec, yes.

[03:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: That doesn't seem quite right because the TAG often have an opinion on how real things are defined and try to apply principles that they derived from abstract considerations to those situations

[03:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: ah well if the discussion was about an application of their principles to a real-world situation, then clearly real-world concerns must also be considered.

[03:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
right

hmm, guess I need to study all that event handler attribute text again to see what to do about XMLHttpRequest...

[03:54:00.0000] <annevk>
it would actually be good if WebIDL defined a binding for it, e.g. EventHandlerAttribute so most of the wording can be moved elsewhere and shared accross specs

[03:55:00.0000] <annevk>
heycam, ^^

[04:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: It seems like seesionStorage would be just as bad from that point of view

[04:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
The web doesn't need architecturally impure constructs like shopping carts anyway

[04:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Cookies shouldn't used as a means to identify say distinct shopping carts between users (though I'm sure it's done) - different resources should be blessed with different URI names." doesn't sound so helpful when I want the URI http://www.amazon.co.uk/ to show me my own shopping cart

[04:15:00.0000] <annevk>
even the W3C uses user credentials to show people different content at the same URL

"DTD based SGML parsers", where are these used?

[05:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, OpenSP is the major one, but its use is limited mainly to validators or non-HTML uses

[05:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
more than that, SP is the only open-source SGML parse, as far as I know

[05:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So there's little reason why a language that doesn't lend itself to DTD-based validation should support it

[05:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, we should be killing DTD-validation

[05:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
at every chance possible

[05:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
James Clark himself said as much

[05:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
some years ago

[05:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"we need to put a knife in the back of SGML" (or something along those lines)

[05:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
he said

[05:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
some might say that it's fairly absurd that in 2009 the W3C Validator is still doing DTD-based validation

[05:26:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I agree, but I don't think people who want to support DTDs will

[05:26:02.0000] <Dashiva>
So a more pragmatic argument might be in order :)

[05:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
some might say that, seeing as this is the year 2009 (not 1989), people who want to support DTDs should probably not be our highest concern

[05:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe the rule should be that if you mention the term "DTD" un-ironically, you get knee-capped

[05:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Judging by the university mailing lists I'm on, "spam" just means any message that you aren't personally interested in, so on the blog you should just delete any comments that don't seem to add anything useful to the post

[05:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
the problem is that DTD based validation has been the only reasonably reliable HTML4 validation method for many years, people have grown accustomed to them

[05:32:02.0000] <Dashiva>
You'd have to invent a machine that lets you kneecap people over the internet first

[05:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Who said it has to be a machine? You could use something like Mechanical Turk to farm the work out

[05:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, the alternative is to simply send the offending person an email virus or perform a DOS attack on them

[05:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
or should we setup virtualkneecap.com?

[05:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I suppose a DOS attack is similar to kneecapping, in online terms

[05:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: RELAX NG has been around since 2000 or so. .. problem was that nobody involved with HTML did much with it until 2006 or so, when fantasai (and then hsivonen) started work on whattf schema  for HTML5 & WF2

[05:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, yes, but there's also the stigma attatched to the DTD as being the only official validation method endorsed by the spec, and alternative validators using different techniques and which didn't strictly adhere to the spec were seen as inferior

[05:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
even if their results were more useful in practice, like claiming unimplemented SGML shorthand features were invalid

[05:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me never even heard of any HTML validators other than validator.w3.org

[05:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: if such sentiment exists, better to just ignore it it without comment

[05:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: we have this thing called validator.nu

[05:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#others

[05:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
v.nu represents a corruption of the ideals

[05:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
there are other ones too, but I can't remember their names or URLs

[05:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, HTML5 in general represents a corruption of many people's ideals

[05:52:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And of idealism in general :)

[05:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
HTML5 is an abomination

[05:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's ironic that 4 or 5 years ago, I shared the ideals of many who are complaining about HTML5 today. Though I've since been corrupted myself :-)

[05:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: that is a sign that you beliefs are changed to easily

[05:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
next year, you'll believe something different

[05:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, no, changing my beliefs is never easy. I'm really quite stubborn

[05:55:03.0000] <MikeSmith>

MikeSmith: I mean, before I was involved with HTML5 I'd never even heard of any HTML validators other than validator.w3.org

[06:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
although I didn't think "smeg" referred to a kind of cheese http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2009/01/bonnie-prince-cheesie.html

[06:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: that's of course because there are none

[06:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or were none before hsivonen appeared

[06:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: Mr Last Week clearly wants to have sex with you

[06:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
with you in particular

[06:03:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
so you can choose to accept that and make it happen, or you 

[06:03:03.0000] <Lachy>
what?!

[06:03:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
can politely decline

[06:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
read between the lines, genius

[06:04:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or he can lie, merely using it as a tool to figure out the secret identity of you-know-who

[06:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm sure we'll figure out the identity of Mr Last Week one day. There's no rush though

[06:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: your IQ is clearly greater than that of former US President George W. Bush

[06:05:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
which puts you in a special class

[06:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
run with it

[06:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
take advantage of it

[06:06:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: What if he just stops posting and disappears? Then it'll be too late

[06:06:03.0000] <Lachy>
woo hoo! I join the elite 90% of the world's population with an IQ greater than Bush.

[06:06:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: strike while the iron is H O T hot

[06:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: you are clearly the sorta super exemplar of our group

[06:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
tall, poised

[06:08:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
represent us well to the world, please

[06:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
take your responsibilities seriously

[06:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
what responsibilities does this new role of mine include?

[06:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: mostly, you have to provide sexual services to any lonely ladies in need of special attention

[06:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
(as far as I read the contract at least)

[06:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, so I'm a gigalo then

[06:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
The problem with http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#three-month-rule is that there is no defined error-handling for the cases where the "must" requirement is violated

[06:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
(or if there is any then it's not implemented in practice)

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Quite a lot of people write <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="4" url="/index.html">

[07:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
all with content="4" in particular

[07:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Assuming you meant http-equiv=refresh (not name=refresh), it seems already work fine in Opera 9.63, so I'm not sure why you'd need to change your implementation

[07:54:00.0000] <karlcow>
[08:46]  <MikeSmith> Lachy: RELAX NG has been around since 2000 or so. .. problem was that nobody involved with HTML did much with it until 2006 or so, when fantasai (and then hsivonen) started work on whattf schema  for HTML5 & WF2

[07:54:01.0000] <karlcow>
not fully true.

[07:55:00.0000] <karlcow>
Olivier has been exploring ways of integrating new methods of validation for a loooooooong time with NVDL and Schematron. Unfortunately nobody had the resources to create a full new engine. The issue always nails down to resources (time, and people)

[07:58:00.0000] <karlcow>
;) At least if in the past Bush had been part of the W3C Team, There would have been an easy way to apologize. 

[07:58:01.0000] <karlcow>
Damn

[08:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://codespeak.net/pipermail/lxml-dev/2009-January/004311.html

[08:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
I guess that competes for "worst idea ever"

[08:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: he needs OWL sameAs

[08:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: And an XSLT engine that understands OWL?

[08:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Amazon EC2's HTTP API is versioned, and if your request uses e.g. ...&Version=2008-12-01&... then the response has xmlns="http://ec2.amazonaws.com/doc/2008-12-01"

[08:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd guess it encourages consumers to just ignore the namespace entirely, because otherwise it's more effort to update it every time you want to start using a newer API version

[09:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think http://lensco.be/ is the first place I've seen anyone write "<!Doctype html>"

[09:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me follows some links from there

[09:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://cameronmoll.com/archives/2009/01/12_resources_for_html5/ - "HTML 5 differences from HTML 4 [link to html5-diff]. Not surprising: frame and frameset no longer allowed in HTML 5. Surprising: A document from the W3C that’s actually fairly readable."

[09:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
"The Web Developer’s Guide to HTML 5 by W3C. I’ve not read this one yet, but it’s got colored boxes — a rarity from the W3C. That must mean it’s good."

[09:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh, the page has this: 

[09:10:01.0000] <zcorpan>
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" content="01; url='http://aac.recruitsoft.com/servlets/CareerSection?art_ip_action=FlowDispatcher&amp;flowTypeNo=13&amp;pageSeq=1&amp;art_servlet_language=en&amp;csNo=2'>

[09:10:02.0000] <zcorpan>
i.e no close "

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, that sounds less typical

[09:11:01.0000] <zcorpan>
the spec bug still applies though

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
url='...' does seem common enough that the spec needs to handle it

[09:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and we might want to discard what's after the '...'

[09:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
should i blog about why people should not use the new elements (i.e. it constrains what useful stuff browsers can do with them)?

[09:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
do we have such examples other than styling of headings?

[09:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems a bit late now to tell people to stop using HTML5 elements, after they've got all excited about them

[09:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe

[09:35:01.0000] <beowulf>
i don't think it's too late, in the 'burbs people are only just discovering html5

[09:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
You could just look at the extensive list of use cases that were required before the new elements were allowed into HTML5

[09:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
although i'm slightly sceptical to styling of headings anyway

[09:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
which surely must include more than just having a second way to style headings

[09:36:02.0000] <zcorpan>
digging the archives is a lot of effort :)

[09:37:00.0000] <smedero>
It is seems fair to raise concerns that implementors have with encountering the new elements in the wild. An explanation of what the state of support is today and why it may or may not continue to work in the future.  

[09:37:01.0000] <smedero>
a full out call to stop using them doesn't seem good though.

[09:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah i didn't have in mind writing a "using html5 elements considered harmful" article

[09:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
It seems quite a few people have already discussed the issues browsers have with the new elements, and appropriate workarounds when necessary, so there's probably not much point writing another one of those

[09:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: but that's with current browsers, it hasn't been widely discussed what happens when browsers implement the parsing rules and apply styling etc

[09:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
e.g. right now you can do <p>foo <section>bar</section> baz</p> (as a silly example)

[09:43:00.0000] <beowulf>
zcorpan: in the future would you not be able to do that?

[09:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
beowulf: no, the <section> would imply </p>

[09:43:02.0000] <beowulf>
i did not know this

[09:43:03.0000] <zcorpan>
if you omit the last </p> the validator wouldn't complain so it might be hard to detect you're relying on it

[09:44:00.0000] <beowulf>
do you mean a ua would close off the para around foo and start a new one on bar?

[09:44:01.0000] <beowulf>
or that the validator would complain?

[09:44:02.0000] <zcorpan>
beowulf: no the <section> start tag would just imply a </p> before it

[09:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so it's equivalent to <p>foo </p><section>bar</section> baz</p>

[09:45:01.0000] <zcorpan>
which in turn is equivalent to <p>foo </p><section>bar</section> baz<p></p>

[09:45:02.0000] <beowulf>
cool

[09:45:03.0000] <zcorpan>
and the validator would complain about the stray </p>

[09:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(so the knee-jerk reaction would be to remove the </p> to silence the validator but it would still break in browsers later)

[09:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe the validator should emit a warning when a <section> causes a </p> to be generated

[09:46:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: consider commenting out new elements in the parser until browsers support them to make the validator messages more helpful

[09:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`'s idea sounds better

[09:47:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: yeah, there's a bug about that in b.v.nu iirc

[09:47:02.0000] <zcorpan>
(or at least about warning about tag inference in general)

[09:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Warning in general would be annoying for people who like tag inference

[09:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i agree

[09:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
but warning in the cases where it differs from current/legacy browser behaviour would still be useful to those people

[09:48:03.0000] <jgraham>
Trying to stop people using HTML 5 is a bad idea. If we dangle nice stuff in front of them and say "oh but you can't have it because it will be bad for you in the future" people are likely to just get annoyed with the whole thing

[09:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
People switched to using XHTML 1.0 despite it offering them no advantages whatsoever and causing subtle problems in the future, so they're bound to do the same with HTML5

[09:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
See e.g. people using <section> and adding script hacks to make it work in IE, despite it being a waste of time and unnecessary complexity

[09:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
when <div class=section> works much better in some UAs, and no worse in any current ones

[09:50:02.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe we should make hsivonen emit messages about things people need to look out for and we can tell people the importance of validation :)

[09:50:03.0000] <jgraham>
Without the early adopters there will be no mainstream HTML5 

[09:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
And we already have had enough bad publicity about unreasonably long schedules

[09:51:01.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe it's just time for browsers to implement the new elements

[09:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Indeed. But I guess it is much easier to say "we need to implement x that people want to use" than to just say "well x is in the spec so we should do it"

[09:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
If the browsers all implement it today, I guess it'd still be a year before they're released

[09:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well if they did it *today* I guess it would be sooner :)

[09:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but only if they put it in their soon-to-be-released branches which seems unlkely)

[09:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/unlkley/impossible/

[09:54:02.0000] <zcorpan>
why would it be impossible?

[09:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
I mean if they wrote the code today, and then put it into wherever they put patches that aren't in the thing that's going to be released very soon and is too late for new features that could have significant web compatibility issues

[09:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Because several major browsers are in feature freeze for imminent releases?

[09:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
(dunno what the ? was for)

[09:56:01.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: yeah but still not impossible - i think it has happened before that features have gone in after feature freeze

[09:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
But it seems like a pretty irresponsible thing to do, particularly for a feature that nobody cares about that much

[09:57:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yes :)

[09:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me should go

[10:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: http://fonts.philip.html5.org/ - very nice! :)

[11:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: The main problem is that it's a terribly ugly site :-)

[11:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The other main problem is that the code is very buggy, but I've been fixing some of those issues so hopefully it'll become slightly less rubbish)

[14:28:00.0000] <heycam>
annevk, fwiw batik doesn't implement @color-profile rules (or the corresponding DOM 2 Style interfaces)

[14:28:01.0000] <heycam>
(or the SVGColorProfileRule interface from SVG, i mean)

[15:37:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, wow, Google is down

[15:40:00.0000] <roc>
google.co.nz is up

[15:41:00.0000] <annevk>
and it's over

[15:42:00.0000] <jcranmer>
how many corporations thought their networks were broken as a result?

[15:42:01.0000] <annevk>
though maybe not everything is up yet

[15:43:00.0000] <annevk>
/me restarted his browser...

[15:43:01.0000] <annevk>
slightly worrisome

[15:45:00.0000] <annevk>
actually, parts still seem down, e.g. reader and gmail

[15:45:01.0000] <annevk>
oh well, past bedtime anyway

[15:46:00.0000] <roc>
gmail's up for me

[15:46:01.0000] <roc>
maybe some datacenter blew up

[15:47:00.0000] <jcranmer>
with walls moving 6 inches?


2009-01-22
[16:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://fonts.philip.html5.org/

[16:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
Now with more exciting front-end

[16:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
and occasional ligature support, at least for cases like "ff" in the DejaVu fonts

[16:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also it violates the licences of some of the fonts, but please don't notice that

[16:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, and it adds IE support too

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
for the fonts that are available freely, it would be useful to be able to download the fonts so that the author can try them on his site

[16:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
and it would be useful to be able to point the script at a site and have it fetch all the files and figure out what characters are needed

[16:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
by parsing the html and css and applying the css even :-)

[16:14:00.0000] <takkaria>
and executing the JS? :)

[16:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure!

[16:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
It wouldn't seem infeasible to let people specify an HTML file and a CSS class name, and have it extract the characters from that

[16:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I guess it's more important to have the basics working first, before adding fancy features like that :-)

[16:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me fixes some bugs so now it should handle Unicode characters too

[16:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's already much more useful than http://www.fontembedding.com/eot/ which just lets you take a perfectly good font and then limit it so it can only work on your own domain, and then gives you a "Unable to load DLL 'makeeot.dll': The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E)"

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
christ, as if xslt wasn't enough: http://www.xsharp.org/samples/

[16:45:00.0000] <roc>
it might be better then XSLT if it doesn't pretend to not be a programming language

[16:47:00.0000] <roc>
uh oh

[18:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: about attributes that are new to HTML5, e.g., ping and sizes

[18:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: the HTML5 spec doesn't say anything about whether conformant UAs must expose those new attributes as properties, right?

[18:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean about supporting them in addition to generic methods; e.g, link.sizes in addition to just link.getAttribute('sizes')

[19:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, the spec lists sizes in the HTMLLinkElement interface

[19:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, yeah, OK

[19:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
and ping in the HTMLAnchorElement interface

[19:01:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[19:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what about the data-* attributes?

[19:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
there's a dataset api http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dom-dataset

[19:28:00.0000] <heycam>
annevk, (re event handler attribute definitions) yeah it would be good to have a common place that defines those

[19:28:01.0000] <heycam>
what does html5 have atm, EventListener or so?  what makes that not enough?

[19:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#event-handler-attributes is what html5 has

[19:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think webidl is the right place for it

[19:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
dom events, maybe

[19:30:02.0000] <heycam>
yeah sounds like it

[19:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think it's fine to have it in html5 for now

[19:31:01.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, in that section: "The second way is as as an ..."

[19:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[22:04:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
hmm, http://fonts.philip.html5.org/ doesn't work for me in opera now

[22:08:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
and ie8

[23:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: shouldn't CSS 'format' for .ttf be format("truetype") and format("opentype") for .otf?

[00:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Not really - the fonts are OpenType, and the OpenType spec says "OpenType fonts may have the extension .OTF or .TTF"

[00:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: do all of Firefox, Safari and Opera support CFF outlines on all their platforms?

[00:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
(or at least it says that for fonts with TrueType outlines)

[00:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No idea, I've only been looking at TrueType-outline ones

[00:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-webfonts/#src

[00:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Oops, looks like Opera only likes format("truetype") and not format("opentype")

[00:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
how do I, as an author, tell if a font is "TrueType" or "TrueType Open"?

[00:38:00.0000] <annevk>
DOM Events would work, but that's not moving...

[00:38:01.0000] <annevk>
And since we could invent some special type of interface... On the other hand, that might make Web IDL depend on HTML5 depending on how it's defined...

[00:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay for SSL. fedorahosted.org's cert expired half an hour ago--blocking access to Liberation fonts

[00:40:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, where is it defined that things bubble from Document to Window?

[00:40:02.0000] <jwalden>
yay for fedorahosted.org and the provider of its cert, more correctly

[00:40:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, and if load is just dispatched on Window, how does document.onload work?

[00:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I've changed it to lie about being format("truetype") now, so it seems to work in Opera

[00:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: It worked for me in IE8 before these changes, and still works, so I'm not sure why it wouldn't work for you

[00:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: As an author, you probably do what I do and assume you might as well say they're OpenType because that's a superset of TrueType, and then find it doesn't work in Opera and so say they're TrueType instead :-)

[00:44:01.0000] <annevk>
why do you use format() at all?

[00:45:00.0000] <annevk>
and please file bugs :)

[00:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
To stop browsers wasting time downloading formats they can't understand

[00:45:02.0000] <annevk>
and how do you make it work in IE?

[00:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: also, with Free fonts that have both .ttf and .otf available, I have no idea which one I should want except that CFF outlines don't work in Prince yet

[00:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
though it's not a very successful plan, because it results in IE downloading both 'foo.eot' and 'foo.ttf) format("truetype"), url(foo.eot'

[00:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oops, I mean 'foo.ttf) format("truetype"), url(foo.eot) format("embedded-opentype"'

[00:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so far, I've noticed that Firefox has superior ligature support compared to Opera and Safari on Mac

[00:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: oh, i had disabled "Font download" in ie

[00:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: By providing EOT files to IE

[00:48:03.0000] <annevk>
well yeah, that's clear by now :p

[00:48:04.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I can imagine that would hamper its ability to download fonts :-)

[00:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: you can reduce the number of 404s by using conditional comments, but dunno about a css-only solution

[00:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Could that be done in a forward-compatible way?

[00:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I want something that'll work in IE9 if they don't change their font support at all (so it needs a @font-face with the .eot, and with no format("...") because IE can't parse that), but will also work if they implement the new @font-face syntax and either do or don't add support for .ttf

[00:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
still, my main concern is that TrueType rendering on Windows is so different from Mac and Linux that it'll be easy to create pages on Mac and Linux and have the page go unreadable on Windows

[00:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Look at the FFF Tusj Bold example on my page - it's awful in Safari on Windows, differently awful in IE8 on Windows, even more broken in Opera on Linux, and works fine in Opera on Linux

[00:53:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: then i guess only by serving IE9 what you have now

[00:53:02.0000] <zcorpan>
which makes it all very crufty

[00:53:03.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Indeed :-(

[00:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: "even more broken in Opera on Linux, and works fine in Opera on Linux" - i guess you meant windows for one of them? :)

[00:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Oh

[00:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: No, I meant "Firefox" for the second one

[00:55:03.0000] <zcorpan>
ah

[00:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Opera seems to only use the font for the "us" and "Bol" parts when rendering the font's name

[00:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
though it works fine with the original non-subsetted .ttf, so it could be the result of a bug in my code

[00:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Ligatures seem to work for me in Firefox on Linux and IE on Windows, and not in Opera on Linux or Safari on Windows

[00:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: my understanding is that Safari intentionally prefers speed over prettiness here

[01:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think it's discriminatory to turn off ligatures for Latin while supporting them for some other scripts

[01:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Preferring anything over prettiness seems contrary to the whole Mac culture :-)

[01:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I thought ligatures made a big difference in othr scripts to the shape so the word looked totally wrong whereas in latin it is only a minor aesthetic difference that only matters at small font size

[01:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It doesn't seem that discriminatory, since for Latin it just makes some character sequences look a bit better, while other scripts are entirely unreadable unless you have ligatures

[01:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
(totally wrong without ligatures)

[01:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, what jgraham said

[01:02:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Ligatures matter in Latin at large font sizes too

[01:02:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I thought they generally looked weird at large font sizes

[01:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
But maybe I am wrong 

[01:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
(do you have nice examples?)

[01:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the word "Quirks" looks great in Linux Libertine in Firefox on Mac

[01:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
not so great in Safari

[01:04:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: for some reason opera seems to use the font on the index page instead of the generated font, or at least i get the glyphs for "ABCFTabcdjlosu123;" instead of those for "Testing abc"

[01:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Try http://fonts.philip.html5.org/ and DejaVu Serif and "fluffily affable fish" in recent Firefox, and try changing the text size

[01:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Oh, I guess it's possible that it's caching fonts by their internal name, or something

[01:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: (and all the subsetted fonts have the same name regardless of which characters are included in them)

[01:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees that his font service is pretty slow for DejaVu fonts :-(

[01:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: i guess we should change that then if font subsetting is supposed to work (or everyone doing font subsetting needs to change the internal name)

[01:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: caching fonts by font name seems like a security hole

[01:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: an attacker can serve a font with misleading glyphs, have it stick into the cache and then wait for the user to navigate to another site using the font

[01:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the browser should instead generated Origin-scoped unpredictably random names for the fonts

[01:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
*generate

[01:18:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: the cache doesn't work cross origin

[01:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
ah

[01:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
actually i think it shouldn't work cross document

[01:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I'm already intending to change my code to give a random meaningless name to each font, since the Open Font License doesn't let you use any of the words of the original font's name

[01:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: so I don't think it's a practical issue for me

[01:19:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: ok

[01:19:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: you could also just do an MD5 on the resulting font data

[01:19:05.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: but it does seem confusing and wrong if fonts are shared based on some internal details that the user might not ever see

[01:19:06.0000] <hsivonen>
that would give the same name to the same subset each time

[01:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: That would be hard, because the font's name is part of the font data :-)

[01:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: That more or less meets my definition of ugly :) (I like the fl ff and fi ligatures at small font size but not at large font size)

[01:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: (as opposed to URL or something like that)

[01:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: only opera has document.onload

[01:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#events-and-the-window-object

[01:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: but md5(original-font-file + list-of-characters-in-subset) seems like it should work fine

[01:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Doesn't the non-ligatured version look uglier with its narrow separated 'f's? :-)

[01:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: yep, i'm filing a bug about it

[01:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Okay, thanks

[01:25:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I see

[01:26:00.0000] <annevk>
I updated http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML5_Presentations by the way, but I think it's far from complete

[01:26:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe I should ask on the blog if people want to contribute to it

[01:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: No, I think it looks better

[01:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
:p

[01:36:00.0000] <annevk>
/me finds http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/HTML4.0/comments.html

[01:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
"In printed form, the HTML 4.0 draft is about 265 printed pages long, and it still contains empty parts to be added later. Compared with the about 77 pages of HTML 2.0, this exhibits an intolerable trend." - seems like the trend is still continuing

[01:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like Yucca has noticed the bogosity of the term 'internationalization' back then

[01:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
'Multilingual support should be labeled as such, or as language-specific support, not as "internationalization". (Typically, multilingualism is important for national documents, whereas most international documents use just English.) '

[01:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is the part about "Further replacements for EM might be something like the following: " serious and not demonstrating the absurdity of semantics?

[02:04:00.0000] <annevk>
if you ignore the RDF bit http://www.w3.org/2005/Talks/05-steven-xtech/ could basically be a talk about HTML5 :)

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: not really. "As generic XML as possible: if a facility exists in XML, try to use that rather than duplicating it."

[02:07:00.0000] <annevk>
oh right, I should've mentioned excluding that line too

[02:07:01.0000] <annevk>
though actually I think we have

[02:07:02.0000] <annevk>
we are using SVG and MathML rather than inventing new vector and math markup

[02:07:03.0000] <annevk>
we encourage people to use xml:lang and xml:base in the XML serialization

[02:08:00.0000] <annevk>
though maybe I'm twisting things too much now :)

[02:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
xml:base might be a bit mistake, but I guess it's too late to get rid of it now

[02:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
xml:base makes sense in machine-generated xml environments

[02:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's a pain on the web

[02:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
actually, xml:base is just one of the many things that flow out of the problem of URIs being too long

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
not really

[02:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't matter how long urls are, sometimes relative urls are a good thing

[02:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
uncs are pretty terse, and they'd still need xml:base if you generated compound documents from unrelated bits

[02:54:00.0000] <annevk>
my weblog no fails to render properly in all stable releases of browsers

[02:54:01.0000] <annevk>
zen

[02:54:02.0000] <annevk>
s/no/now/

[02:55:00.0000] <virtuelv>
also "SVG sucks"

[02:55:01.0000] <annevk>
thanks to zcorpan, rubys, and Robbert Broersma

[02:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oooh

[02:56:01.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: you should've used a web font

[02:56:02.0000] <annevk>
virtuelv, I use two

[02:56:03.0000] <virtuelv>
not in the logo?

[02:56:04.0000] <annevk>
how's that?

[02:57:00.0000] <annevk>
name me a font that can render the logo :)

[02:57:01.0000] <annevk>
(Weblog 4.2 is rendered using a normal font though)

[02:57:02.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: make your own :D

[02:58:00.0000] <annevk>
I think using SVG is cheaper ;)

[02:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: SVG fonts!

[02:59:00.0000] <virtuelv>
there's also something odd about an image of Mandrake next to a screenshot from Ubuntu

[02:59:01.0000] <virtuelv>
you should replace it with a trace of Mark Shuttleworth

[02:59:02.0000] <virtuelv>
svg, of course

[02:59:03.0000] <annevk>
you can do that on your own blog ;)

[03:00:00.0000] <virtuelv>
meh, neh

[03:00:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I'll keep the orange to annoy a co-worker

[03:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
svg fonts from the html would be a pretty awesome way to do it

[03:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you want things to not work

[03:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[03:01:03.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: what did Robbert Broersma do, btw?

[03:01:04.0000] <annevk>
that actually works in Safari and Opera I think, might even be in Safari 3.1

[03:01:05.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, making the menu in CSS ages ago

[03:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: ah ok

[03:02:01.0000] <annevk>
though he hadn't done the font embedding hting

[03:03:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems Opera requires a reload for SVG images loaded through the content property when the content property is applied to an element?

[03:03:01.0000] <annevk>
o_O

[03:04:00.0000] <annevk>
also, the daddy font doesn't work in Opera 10 but does in non-branched stuff

[03:04:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[03:04:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: seems to work for me

[03:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh wait

[03:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah i get the first bug

[03:06:00.0000] <annevk>
the font thing might be Linux only

[03:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: should i file a bug for the reload thing?

[03:09:00.0000] <annevk>
please

[03:13:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, it seems to be a bug for 'content' on ::after as well

[03:13:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, so it's slightly less weird I suppose

[03:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it just doesn't happen for daddy.svg?

[03:25:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, it does

[03:25:01.0000] <annevk>
at least, when I tested again in core-2.3...

[03:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
weird, doesn't happen for me

[03:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, why doesn't Opera 10 render the web font for the left navigation menu?

[03:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
it looks like only webkit is getting that right

[03:34:02.0000] <annevk>
might be a Mac issue

[03:34:03.0000] <annevk>
it does on Linux

[03:34:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I'll try windows

[03:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone ought to write a web browser that isn't rubbish

[03:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
If you could write a web page and it would actually work, that'd be a great step forward

[03:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, we're hiring if you would like to help with that :-)

[03:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Sadly I've got a PhD I need to finish first, which will keep me occupied for the next couple of years :-)

[03:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
what topic are you doing your PhD on?

[03:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's some kind of network routing stuff

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, weird indeed, because now it does load again...

[03:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: now i could reproduce the :after bug in opera 10

[03:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me confused

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
cc rune and let him figure it out? :)

[03:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, the menu font works on windows, so it must be a Mac bug

[03:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me likes the way that Philip` is so vauge about his PhD

[03:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: That's because I don't really know what I'm doing :-p

[03:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: or because you can figure it out when you start working on it?

[03:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I've been working on it for a year already :-)

[03:56:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: ah. how far have you come?

[03:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me found that a lot of his PhD was thinking of cool things that would be useful then finding that they were too hard to actually do so doing easier but less cool things instead

[03:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
Also PhD-related protip: never ask PhD students how far thay have got. 

[03:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm working as part of a smallish group (about six people), so mostly I've been learning what other people have been doing and writing some code to make things work and planning what I ought to spend the next couple of years working on :-)

[03:59:01.0000] <jgraham>

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, can you file it, since you have a Mac and all? :)

[04:03:00.0000] <annevk>
my Macbook is elsewhere atm

[04:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll add it to my list of other bugs I really need to get filed today

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk>
Opera's fallback for 'content' is also screwed I notice, but I think it might be per the current draft, but not per the agreed upon changes to the current draft

[04:13:01.0000] <annevk>
might be correct*

[04:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:21:01.0000] <annevk>
g'night

[04:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
what's the best way to make a test case for a web font that relies on the correct rendering of the downloaded font, and still make it clear what the result should look like?

[04:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
should I just include an image of the font in the TC for testers to compare it with?

[04:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: depends on how complex the determination of "correct" is

[04:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: for mere @font-face presence checking, you could use the Ahem trick Hixie used for Acid 3

[04:37:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, does it rely on correct rendering? you could e.g. say "The following two lines should have different fonts" "line 1" "line 2" first styled with font-family:custom,serif and the second with font-family:serif

[04:37:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: you could make the bogus 404 url redirect to the eot (or make a copy of the eot file with the bogus file name)

[04:37:02.0000] <annevk>
for correct rendering a screenshot would be best I suppose

[04:37:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: basically the same idea as http://annevankesteren.nl/2005/10/ie-import-hack

[04:40:00.0000] <annevk>
/me reads that post again and almost gets upset again by the comments

[04:41:00.0000] <annevk>
aah, a fresh Firefox nightly renders the fonts for the menu and heading correct, but it doesn't do any of the content property thingies

[04:42:00.0000] <annevk>
and thanks to the new style rules for the search form it no longer overflows, but I think that's a bug with the new style rules :)

[04:42:01.0000] <annevk>
(i.e. not something that was fixed)

[04:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: that would be min-width on body

[04:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: is there any UA that renders your new blog heading correctly?

[04:45:01.0000] <annevk>
Opera 10 alpha after a refresh

[04:46:00.0000] <annevk>
though maybe only on non-Mac platforms

[04:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I see. Refrest fixed your name but "Weblog 4.2" is still ugly

[04:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
*Refresh

[04:47:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, apparently that font doesn't work well on Mac yet

[04:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: some weird TTF tables?

[04:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
or lack thereof?

[04:47:03.0000] <annevk>
/me is a font noob

[04:47:04.0000] <annevk>
Lachy will find a bug so supposedly I'll find out when they debug it :)

[04:48:00.0000] <annevk>
s/find a bug/file a bug/

[04:48:01.0000] <annevk>
duh

[04:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: You could make the downloaded font a serif one, and the page's default font a sans-serif one, and say "This line should have a serif font", and hope the testers understand what that means

[04:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I disagree about the gracefulness of the degradation of the blog title

[04:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.webfonts.info/wiki/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=7 seems a nice way of testing specific font-rendering features

[04:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: "Kesteren" is virtually unreadable in Firefox 3.0.x

[04:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
(The font is set up so that e.g. the string "ab" is treated as a ligature and rendered as "liga [tick]" if it's working correctly)

[04:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
why is "TEST" blinking in Firefox?

[04:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: whoa! you actually used text-decoration: blink!!!

[04:55:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, with graceful I meant that you can read the content, not that the heading is necessarily usable

[04:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: ok

[04:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: I currently like the idea of having people download the font files and copy them onto their own web server, which should be as easy as possible and shouldn't involve setting up redirects or crazy filenames

[04:56:01.0000] <annevk>
ah yeah, the text-decoration effect only works in Firefox, guess no browser gets it right then :D

[04:56:02.0000] <hsivonen>
in my pending redesign, I'm using CSS generated content with a PUA character for <hr>s. Is that theoretically pure enough or are PUA chars always theoretically wrong?

[04:57:00.0000] <annevk>
seems to me that stuff inside CSS shouldn't matter

[04:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the result is OK without CSS or with CSS when @font-face is supported

[04:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but it doesn't with CSS without @font-face

[04:58:00.0000] <annevk>
I gave up on making that combination work

[04:58:01.0000] <annevk>
quite fast

[04:58:02.0000] <annevk>
my criteria was that it had to be usable, not pretty

[05:02:00.0000] <annevk>
it's a CSS problem, just as with different fonts, you want to apply a different set of CSS rules when 'content' fails to apply, but you can't

[05:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
seems webkit doesn't apply the font for daddy.svg when used in 'content'

[05:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the 'find' button is also misplaced for some reason

[05:09:00.0000] <annevk>
simonw once had this CSS series called "CSS ain't Rocket Science"

[05:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees CORE-17018 already exists about format("opentype") in Opera

[05:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: you should also use some rounded corners :-)

[05:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: You should write your entire page upside-down, and then use CSS Transformations to turn it round again

[05:14:00.0000] <annevk>
in half a year or so I'll add some transforms and transitions

[05:14:01.0000] <annevk>
to increase the menu buttons for instance

[05:14:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, they are passe :p

[05:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: passé or not, you could use some dotted rounded corners. they don't work right in any of the top 4 browsers

[05:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
double works in Gecko but sucks in WebKit

[05:16:00.0000] <annevk>
under the assumption layout developers want my blog to render correctly? :)

[05:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
of course

[05:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: if you go too far ahead then they'll ignore the whole thing :)

[05:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand this font bug. The fonts work on http://fonts.philip.html5.org/ but not when I download them and load them from localhost

[05:27:00.0000] <annevk>
do fonts work from localhost at all?

[05:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
They should. I'm running Apache, not just using file:///

[05:30:00.0000] <annevk>
k

[05:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
it seems to be either falling back to some sans-serif font that looks a lot like Helvetica, or it is using Helvetica with a narrower letter-spacing

[05:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Try checking Apache's access_log to see if the fonts are actually being downloaded?

[05:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll have to find out where they're stored

[05:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Also, are these the fonts which are used on the index page there, or the fonts that are generated when you click the button?

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: If it's Linuxish then it's probably /var/log/apache/access_log

[05:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/apache/apache2/

[05:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
I downloaded one of the fonts you're using on the page

[05:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
but my TC is using Anne's font though

[07:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Okay - I was just thinking you might need to be careful when downloading the fonts used on the index page, since they're gzipped regardless of whether your UA sends Accept-Encoding

[07:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I should probably set up mod_gzip properly instead)

[07:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I used wget to download it. I assume it would have unzipped it for me

[07:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
$ wget http://fonts.philip.html5.org/indexfonts/3a3846bc220dd7f0aadb8b12d839e6f4.ttf

[07:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
$ file 3a3846bc220dd7f0aadb8b12d839e6f4.ttf

[07:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
3a3846bc220dd7f0aadb8b12d839e6f4.ttf: gzip compressed data

[07:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
$ gzip -cd 3a3846bc220dd7f0aadb8b12d839e6f4.ttf|file -

[07:48:04.0000] <Philip`>
/dev/stdin: TrueType font data

[07:48:05.0000] <Philip`>
So, wget doesn't unzip it for you

[07:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Those filenames are a bit ugly, really

[07:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
why do you use such ugly file names?

[08:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I needed something unique, so I just used an MD5 of the font name and the included characters

[08:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: and it would be a bad idea to use the original font's filename, because then the subsets would get confused with each other and with the original

[08:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`, Lachy: it seems gzip works as a copying deterrent after all :-)

[08:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: But it only deters competent users who know about wget, not normal users who would paste the URL into their browser, so it's not a hugely effective deterrent :-p

[08:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
...at least when it's just HTTP gzip compressed transmission

[08:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
If the actual files were distributed as compressed data, over an uncompressed HTTP transmission, then it would indeed be more effective :-)

[08:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it works in WebKit when I unzip the file.

[08:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
That test partially works in Opera too, except only some of the letters rendered using that font.

[08:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, Opera has trouble rendering strings comprising all 26 letters in the right font, though it works better if I put in a few spaces

[08:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, I see. once Opera hits a character not included in the web font, it won't revert back to that font for subsequent letters until after a space

[08:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me hopes the sensible thing to do with Apple Advanced Typographic tables in fonts is simply to delete them, as an attempt to promote cross-platformness

[08:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, are the font files you're serving from that page completely valid, or are they likely to contain errors?

[08:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
I mean the ones you're using, not the copies the generator will spit out

[08:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and keep the OpenType tables which allow similar functionality, and are supported on Windows and Linux and apparently at least partly on OS X, so hopefully the world will converge on that)

[08:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: The ones on the index page are spat out by the generator too

[08:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: so they're likely to have similar bugs

[08:43:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Is there a font validator somewhere?

[08:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use the font and write some text, and if it looks okay then it's valid enough :-)

[08:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not aware of any tools that do any kind of comprehensive checking

[08:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Perhaps someone (you!) should develop one, so we can help reduce the occurrence of erroneous fonts occuring on the web once webfonts take off

[08:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I'm pretty sure the subsetted fonts I'm generating are buggy

[08:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
which tool are you using to generate them?

[08:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
It doesn't seem so useful to have a validator for fonts since they're all generated by software, so there won't be millions of people introducing millions of syntax errors

[08:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm using the Font::TTF Perl module, plus a load of custom code that strips out lots of glyphs and then tries to update all the internal references to be consistent

[08:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
having validators will still allow people to check that the fonts their tools are generating are valid and will help the developers of those tools find and fix bugs

[08:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Assuming the validator works correctly

[08:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
and it will also help browser vendors diagnose bugs

[08:48:02.0000] <Lachy>
Validators should exist for image and video formats too.

[08:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
(I did find one for MP4 once, but it cost thousands of dollars and was aimed at the pro market)

[08:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: BTW Black Box Recorder (music)

[08:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: What?

[08:51:02.0000] <jgraham>
Bands you should lsten to. Black Box Recorder

[08:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
ah

[08:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: http://se.youtube.com/watch?v=FP-2VLQEv4c

[08:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://browsershots.org/http://annevankesteren.nl/

[08:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/ includes TTX, which converts fonts to an XML format, which can be useful for debugging

[08:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is attempting to more comprehensively look through all the interesting OpenType tables, to work out which ones he really needs to process and which can just be ignored or dropped

[08:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
and then I should be more confident that I'm producing correct output

[08:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
(The main problem is forgetting to update all the references to glyphs that have been removed)

[09:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: n00b

[09:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: If you want to read http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gsub.htm and let me know exactly how to keep everything consistent when some glyphs are removed, please feel free :-)

[09:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Nah

[09:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh shit.

[09:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I said I'd do one thing for Hixie by today.

[09:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
One thing in particular, or just any thing?

[09:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me starts humming 'I'd do anything' or whatever that song from 'Oliver' is called

[09:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Anolis template

[11:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i think i have an idea for how to do cross-spec references btw

[11:25:01.0000] <takkaria>
any opera people around?

[11:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
without having to load both specs

[11:25:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: How?

[11:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: and: email.

[11:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
just have a declaration mechanism that "imports" some names

[11:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yt?

[11:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yt?

[11:56:00.0000] <annevk>
am now

[12:05:00.0000] <takkaria>
annevk: do you know who deals with the applications for jobs at opera?

[12:05:01.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xhtml2/2009Jan/0059.html I hope no market leader will ever attempt to natively support XHTML2; that'll become a huge mess to sort out

[12:06:00.0000] <annevk>
takkaria, HR department

[12:08:00.0000] <annevk>
takkaria, they'll pass it along to the appropriate people who will then get back to you (I think it works like that more or less)

[12:10:00.0000] <takkaria>
right, ta

[12:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has one slight issue wrt applying to Opera

[12:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't know if I'm going to take a gap year or not; if I don't I could get a summer internship, if I do I could try and get a job for nearer a year

[12:21:00.0000] <annevk>
you can apply for a summer internship and if you like it and we like you stay for a year

[12:21:01.0000] <dglazkov>
gsnedders: apply to Google :)

[12:21:02.0000] <annevk>
that sentence requires another you and a comma, but you get the idea

[12:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: If I take a gap year, I really need to be around in the UK running off to places all the time in September, which makes it rather not sensible to start before Oct.

[12:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
dglazkov: And quite how low are my chances at getting a job without a degree? :)

[12:23:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, planes exist for a reason

[12:23:02.0000] <dglazkov>
gsnedders: a degree of what? ;)

[12:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Yeah, but taking, say, four weeks off might not make me popular :)

[12:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
dglazkov: Oh, I dunno. A university one? :)

[12:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, yo

[12:24:03.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, it doesn't seem like a huge deal to me

[12:25:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, finished your internship, go home, and then come back again later to work on something else...

[12:25:01.0000] <dglazkov>
universities are just deprecated facilities for teaching young people about procrastination and the value of borrowing someone else's work :)

[12:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Also, I'm not really meant to apply for the internship until I'm enrolled in a uni course :P

[12:25:03.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. the deadline for comments on CSS3 Web Fonts is 2002-08-30

[12:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
dglazkov: But pretty much everything in this industry requires a degree :(

[12:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Think you can make that, then?

[12:26:02.0000] <dglazkov>
gsnedders: :(

[12:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Perhaps you want http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/ instead? :-)

[12:27:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, it's being moved back to WD

[12:27:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, and you want the URL Philip` points out

[12:27:03.0000] <hsivonen>
thanks

[12:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Also, if I take a gap year, it'd be nice to have a couple of months at the start to try and do all these damned things I keep saying I'll do

[12:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(If anyone wants to hire me for Oct–Aug/Sep, let me know :P)

[12:34:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, so start later, or convince someone at Opera to pay for it :)

[12:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: A fair amount of the things it is almost certain that Opera wouldn't :)

[12:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok time to get ready. bbl.

[12:38:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, it almost seems like you don't want to apply

[12:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I'll hire you, as long as you don't expect any financial compensation for your time

[12:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: I'm indecisive :P

[15:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me discovers that Opera doesn't like changing styles (e.g. colour) in the middle of a ligature

[15:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
(whereas Firefox handles it pretty nicely)

[15:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Hmm... Opera/Safari never do Latin ligatures, but do do Arabic ligatures (probably not what they're called but the same idea) that get broken when you change style in the middle; IE and Firefox do both Latin and Arabic ligatures, but IE breaks Latin ligatures when you change style)

[15:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
(So it's not entirely consistent :-( )

[15:35:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: is it defined currently whether an onload handler for a frame needs to wait for all subresources to load before firing?

[15:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[15:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
search for "delay the load event"

[15:35:03.0000] <weinig>
thanks

[15:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
the spec isn't very thorough yet though, if you spot anything missing let me know

[15:36:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: I am thinking about external references to SVGFonts

[15:36:01.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: so that is probably not covered

[15:37:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: but is required by Acid 3

[15:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
external from what, css?

[15:37:02.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: no, other svg

[15:37:03.0000] <weinig>
            <font-face-uri xlink:href="font.svg#mini"/></font-face-src>

[15:37:04.0000] <weinig>
type things

[15:37:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh then ask the svgwg

[15:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's a hook in html5 if they want to define it

[15:40:00.0000] <roc>
Philip`: glad someone noticed, an awful lot of pain went into that. My pain.

[15:40:01.0000] <roc>
the Arabic forms are correctly called ligatures, BTW

[15:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've been tempted to use Zapfino's "Zapfino" ligature in Acid4

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
huh, firefox isn't rendering Zapfino's Zapfino ligature for me

[15:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
it does the "pf" ligature inside "Zapfino"

[15:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
safari doesn't even do that

[15:44:03.0000] <heycam>
weinig, so that'd be:  <iframe src=something.svg>, and in something.svg you have that reference to an SVG font resource in a different file, and you'd like to know whether that impacts the load event dispatched to the iframe?

[15:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
and opera does both

[15:45:00.0000] <weinig>
heycam: exactly

[15:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: how do you mean, it doesn't handle colour changes?

[15:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Seems kind of difficult to rely on Zapfino when most computers don't have that font and it's presumably not freely redistributable

[15:45:03.0000] <weinig>
heycam: ala Acid3

[15:45:04.0000] <roc>
Hixie: the "Zapfino" ligature is a "discretionary" ligature

[15:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
roc: aah

[15:45:06.0000] <roc>
we disabled discretionary ligatures because in many situations authors don't want them

[15:45:07.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, you do handle the colour change in a ligature well

[15:46:01.0000] <roc>
we need a CSS extension to provide this control to authors ... one of our guys has it on his to-do list

[15:46:02.0000] <heycam>
weinig, ok.  we don't say anything on the matter currently.  how does it work normally with HTML in an iframe?  does the load on the iframe happen as a result of the load dispatched to the html in the frame?

[15:46:03.0000] <heycam>
weinig_, ok.  we don't say anything on the matter currently.  how does it work normally with HTML in an iframe?  does the load on the iframe happen as a result of the load dispatched to the html in the frame?

[15:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i was considering asking apple to license a tiny subset of it for ahem purposes. but i doubt i will go down that road in acid4 anyway.

[15:47:01.0000] <roc>
Philip`: yeah, but we could just do something like a Hixifino font with a Hixifino ligature

[15:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
right

[15:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
if we want to test this at all

[15:47:04.0000] <Philip`>
roc: If I was really picky, I could complain that e.g. "f<font color=red>f</font>i" in Linux Libertine doesn't work perfectly, since the redness is shifted a bit too far left and covers part of the first 'f', but at least it's nicer than deligaturising them entirely :-)

[15:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
which isn't clear given the state of the relevant specs

[15:48:00.0000] <roc>
ligatures don't need a spec IMHO, at least for "required ligatures"

[15:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like you're wanting http://www.webfonts.info/wiki/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=7

[15:48:02.0000] <roc>
Philip`: there's just no way to do it perfectly

[15:48:03.0000] <roc>
the fonts don't have enough info

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: well, i mean there's nothing in CSS that says how to colour one or the other part of a ligature

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: i agree that TTF+CSS is enough to require that ligatures be shown at all

[15:49:02.0000] <roc>
yeah

[15:49:03.0000] <roc>
but you could test <span>f</span><span>i</span>

[15:49:04.0000] <weinig_>
heycam: the onload happens when the main resource for the iframe is done loading and all subresources defined to delay the onload have also finished 

[15:49:05.0000] <roc>
and see if that creates a ligature

[15:49:06.0000] <Hixie>
roc: right, if there are any browsers that fail thatbut pass fi (are there? i assume there won't be by acid4)

[15:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: It looks like OpenType has the features for that (in GDEF's "ligature caret positioning information"), but I haven't seen any fonts that provide that data (though I've only looked at a handful of fonts)

[15:50:01.0000] <roc>
Hixie: I don't know ... getting from "fi" working to "<span>f</span>i" working is a ton of work

[15:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, actually, Linux Libertine does appear to provide that data

[15:51:00.0000] <roc>
well, it depends on how the engine is implemented, but for most "obvious" implementations I imagine it's hard

[15:51:01.0000] <roc>
Philip`: it does? what table?

[15:52:00.0000] <heycam>
weinig_, ok so that's possibly later than the load event dispatched to the iframe's window object?

[15:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
roc: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/gdef.htm - "The LigatureCaretList table contains positioning data for ligature carets, which the text-processing client uses on screen to select and highlight the individual components of a ligature glyph."

[15:52:02.0000] <weinig_>
heycam: I don't think so

[15:52:03.0000] <heycam>
oh

[15:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
roc: both opera and mozilla do it, and safari doesn't do ligatures at all

[15:53:00.0000] <roc>
yay us I guess

[15:53:01.0000] <heycam>
weinig_, load dispatched to the <iframe> and load dispatched to the iframe content's window object are distinct, yes?

[15:53:02.0000] <roc>
but I assure you it was hard :-)

[15:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that IE dynamically deligaturises ligatures when you attempt to select individual characters

[15:54:01.0000] <weinig_>
heycam: I am not sure, but I didn't think so

[15:54:02.0000] <heycam>
weinig_, ok well i don't have a good understanding of html-ish things like this, so i'm probably wrong

[15:54:03.0000] <Philip`>
...or even when you simply click on the ligature and don't move the mouse

[15:54:04.0000] <roc>
Philip`: Libertine has that eh? Cool ... unfortunately, however, platform APIs don't provide that data AFAIK so I'll have to wait until we have our own shaping code before we can use it

[15:55:00.0000] <roc>
Philip`: oh, so selection can change the layout? Urgh

[15:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: i believe you :-)

[15:55:02.0000] <heycam>
weinig_, when you do <iframe onload=...> does that actually register a listener on the iframe content's window object then?

[15:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: The layout of the rest of the line doesn't seem to change, it just renders the ligature as individual glyphs

[15:56:01.0000] <heycam>
/me finds this in the spec: "When content loads in an iframe, after any load events are fired within the content itself, the user agent must fire a load event at the iframe element."

[15:56:02.0000] <roc>
ick

[15:56:03.0000] <heycam>
/me wonders then if the load dispatched to the iframe content's window object is considered to be "within the content itself"

[15:56:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, also it seems to have broken spacing after ligatures, like it's using the spacing for the non-ligature glyphs, though that might be because my font subsetter is buggy

[15:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: that text is horrible, i should fix that to be well-defined


2009-01-23
[16:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me goes back to the great fun of trying to fix up the GPOS table, with its six zillion different types of data it can contain

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me blog

[16:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
s

[16:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
my political correctness filter failed

[16:05:00.0000] <heycam>
weinig_, anyway i suspect that SVG wouldn't define things that "delay the load event" for the containing <iframe>, and that the iframe's load event would be dispatched as soon as the root <svg>'s load is dispatched

[16:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
"it can be far easier accomplished by changing the operational behavior of browsers such that they always send Referer" - it seems to quite (most?) often be proxies and firewalls (including software firewalls on end-users' machines) that strip Referer, so there's nothing the browser can do about it

[16:05:02.0000] <weinig_>
heycam: I think it is actually not that cut and dry

[16:05:03.0000] <heycam>
weinig_, @externalResourcesRequired can be used to delay the load event dispatched to the root <svg>

[16:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: is the root SVGLoad delayed until the font is loaded?

[16:05:05.0000] <heycam>
no?

[16:05:06.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, depends on eRR, i believe

[16:05:07.0000] <weinig_>
heycam: in SVG exteralResourcesRequired is used to delay

[16:05:08.0000] <weinig_>
indeed

[16:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can just hardcode that the SVG 'load' event is what we wait for if the resource isn't html

[16:06:01.0000] <heycam>
right, but it delays the load dispatched to the <svg>

[16:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
or whatever

[16:06:03.0000] <weinig_>
the root SVGLoad is only delayed if externalResourcesRequired=true

[16:06:04.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, that sounds like what i'd expect

[16:07:00.0000] <heycam>
i suppose the current text wouldn't work for that because SVG doesn't say anything about load events bubbling up to the window object

[16:07:01.0000] <heycam>
i guess dom 3 events will solve that?

[16:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
the current text doesn't work for html either

[16:08:01.0000] <heycam>
ah :)

[16:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. as written it implies you could fire a fake 'load' event and that'd be enough

[16:09:01.0000] <heycam>
i see

[16:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
crap, forgot my power cord. bbiab.

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me uses someone else's

[16:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
woohoo, appcache feedback done

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
shepazu: yt?

[16:50:00.0000] <campd>
Hixie: hrm

[16:50:01.0000] <campd>
Hixie: if I'm reading this right, a 404 of the manifest will cause an "error" to be fired to pending master entries

[16:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
right

[16:50:03.0000] <campd>
Hixie: but not a network/content-type/magic error

[16:50:04.0000] <campd>
is that intentional?

[16:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
network error should do, did i screw that up?

[16:50:06.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks

[16:51:00.0000] <campd>
misreading

[16:51:01.0000] <campd>
err, I think I misread

[16:51:02.0000] <campd>
yeah, misread

[16:51:03.0000] <campd>
never mind

[16:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are some cases where they get associated with an older cache, which come to think of it might break them...

[16:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm, crap, i should fix that

[16:57:00.0000] <campd>
:/

[16:59:00.0000] <campd>
while you're at it, I saw a few typos

[16:59:01.0000] <campd>
want 'em here, or email?

[16:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
dump them here, i can fix them all at once

[16:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
since i'm editing it already

[16:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[16:59:05.0000] <campd>
"optinally"

[17:02:00.0000] <campd>
hrm, lost the other one

[17:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
i found a "discrad"

[17:04:00.0000] <campd>
that's it

[17:05:00.0000] <campd>
/me will be spending tomorrow seeing how much of these changes we can fit in to 3.1

[17:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok fixed all the typos and made the case of the manifest failing not cause the resources to get associated

[17:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
which would probably just break them and/pr poison the cache

[17:05:03.0000] <campd>
nod

[17:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
the new text is much better than the old text

[17:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
to start with it doesn't confuse cache and cache group all the time

[17:06:02.0000] <campd>
yeah

[17:10:00.0000] <campd>
Hixie: hrm, you think it's ok to violate no-store for different-origin entries?

[17:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno. right now the spec implies it (which is why i added the note pointing it out)

[17:10:02.0000] <campd>
yeah

[17:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
do you think we should drop them? seems weird to not cache things in the manifest.

[17:11:00.0000] <campd>
I agree

[17:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
ap said webkit keeps them, fwiw

[17:11:02.0000] <campd>
it makes sense to treat the manifest as superceding cache directives

[17:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[17:12:01.0000] <campd>
but it's kinda weird that evil.com's manifest can supercede normal.com's cache directives

[17:12:02.0000] <campd>
(it sounds worse when I call the first domain evil.com)

[17:13:00.0000] <campd>
(we implement it as currently specified, fwiw)

[17:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah the cross-domain thing is weird, but, well, all it does is mean that if you go to evil.com you can end up with normal.com's sensitive information in your cache, right?

[17:14:01.0000] <campd>
yeah.

[17:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, i just realised

[17:15:01.0000] <campd>
can't think of any real exploit/problem, just, y'know, weird.

[17:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
a site can use this to probe another site's filespace

[17:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess you can already do that with iframes

[17:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
kinda

[18:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk, i'm confused by the thread you're involved in (http://www.w3.org/mid/OFBC06637C.5D87622B-ON85257547.000D2A49-85257547.000DE226⊙lc)

[18:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's wrong with xhtml?

[18:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow

[18:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
adam posts http://www.adambarth.com/papers/2008/barth-jackson-mitchell-b.pdf

[18:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
a detailed paper with real data

[18:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
roy then posts http://www.w3.org/mid/3FD529DB-78D5-4561-AEAB-99F80BB26ADA⊙gc

[18:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
which makes assertions contradicting the data

[19:00:00.0000] <takkaria>
Roy does seem a tad idealistic

[19:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me finally convinces himself that he's probably handling the GPOS font table correctly, but sees that it apparently has precisely zero effect in the browsers he's testing

[19:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
(so I could just as well delete the entire table)

[19:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's it for?

[19:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Mostly for fun, and otherwise for making subsets of fonts that won't take minutes to download over the web

[19:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
no i mean the GPOS table

[19:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[19:08:03.0000] <Philip`>
"The Glyph Positioning table (GPOS) provides precise control over glyph placement for sophisticated text layout and rendering in each script and language system that a font supports."

[19:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
i... see

[19:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. like in http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/fig4e.gif you can set it so that diacritics following an overhanging capital letter will be positioned downwards a bit

[19:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
or you can use it to make cursive scripts fit together better

[19:10:01.0000] <hdh>
is that the same as kerning?

[19:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: wow, neat. and nobody does it?

[19:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's sad

[19:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
hdh: Kerning is much simpler - it's just an added horizontal offset between a pair of glyphs

[19:11:03.0000] <Philip`>
whereas this thing lets you use classes of glyphs, and more context than just pairs, and all sorts of other crazy stuff that I don't understand

[19:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I assume it's implemented somewhere, just not in the fonts and browsers and example strings that I'm using

[19:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[19:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
particularly since I'm miserly and using free fonts, of which there are very few that do advanced typography

[19:21:00.0000] <roc>
Philip`: what platform are you testing? Windows?

[19:21:01.0000] <roc>
We should support all the features that Uniscribe does, since we just use Uniscribe for this

[19:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: Linux

[19:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me should probably try it on Windows some time

[19:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
but after going to bed :-)

[19:25:00.0000] <roc>
well then, on Linux we support everything Pango supports

[19:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
well bummer, my next task is to work out how UAs handle content-type for <Script>

[19:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
what i expect to find is taht they ignore the type and just look for a charset...

[19:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
even if the type doesn't allow charset

[19:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey wow, i have some tests that are polyglots!

[19:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/script/008-test-plain-none.txt

[20:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
if someone can work out a way of making my a polyglot js file that is valid JS in both UTF-8 and UTF-16, that would be awesome

[20:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
even if all it did was a() in UTF-8 and b() in UTF-16

[20:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow

[20:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/script/011-demo.html

[20:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
IE8 ignores the Content-Type header altogether

[20:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
even for ;charset= processing

[20:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's crazy!

[20:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
nobody else does

[20:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
every other browser looks for ;charset=""

[20:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
did i do something wrong maybe?

[22:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I admire abarth's patience

[22:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I admire abarth in general

[22:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I do hope his patience holds out

[22:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
was just reading the Origin thread

[22:23:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I figured that's what you were referring to

[22:24:00.0000] <jruderman>
is this the same thread where someone claimed CSRF is just a browser bug?

[22:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
jruderman: the someone being Roy Fielding

[22:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
though I don't think he worded it that way exactly

[22:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"CSRF is not a security issue for the Web... If browsers create a security issue because they allow scripts to automatically direct requests with stored security credentials onto third-party sites, without any user intervention/configuration, then the obvious fix is within the browser."

[22:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
is what he said

[22:27:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2009JanMar/0037.html

[22:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I should subscribe to ietf-http-wg

[22:37:00.0000] <jruderman>
/me realizes that Roy Fielding is one of the authors of the HTTP spec

[22:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jruderman: also the author of the famous REST architecture paper

[22:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jruderman: (the paper that coined the term -- I guess it was his thesis)

[22:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: abarth is a god

[22:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
(that is my professional opinion)

[22:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
however if he applies for any jobs you should NOT hire him. _I_ want him. :-P

[22:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
on another note, does anyone have any insight into who IE behaves so very differently to the other browsers on http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/script/011-demo.html ?

[22:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
(it seems to ignore the ;charset=... part of the MIME type, unlike other UAs)

[22:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I don't generally actively poach from other browser vendors but if he applies, I make no promises

[00:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: :-)

[00:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok seriously, what's with IE

[00:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
I don't get it

[00:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
does it not support setting the character encoding on the fly at all?

[00:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: do you have data on mime types that <script src=""> files are sent with?

[00:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
the web seems to suggest that IE really doesn't support this, wow

[00:25:00.0000] <jruderman>
http://www.whitehouse.gov/includes/functions.js.aspx is text/html

[00:25:01.0000] <jruderman>
that file also contains some head-spinners, like

[00:25:02.0000] <jruderman>
if ( isLeapYear(y)) MonthArray[1] = eval(eval(MonthArray[1]) + 1);

[00:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
does MonthArray contain strings or numbers?

[00:27:01.0000] <jruderman>
well, uh

[00:27:02.0000] <jruderman>
strings, up until that line

[00:27:03.0000] <jruderman>
 Months = "31/!/28/!/31/!/30/!/31/!/30/!/31/!/31/!/30/!/31/!/30/!/31";

[00:27:04.0000] <jruderman>
 MonthArray  = Months.split("/!/");

[00:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, that question led to more pain than i expected

[00:28:01.0000] <jruderman>
after that line, it might contain one number

[00:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
I wonder what led to that code

[00:29:00.0000] <jruderman>
hehe

[00:36:00.0000] <annevk>

webben_, you should write tutorials man; you write many long good e-mails, but they all get lost in archives unless you collect them somehow (you could put stuff on blog.whatwg.org or wiki.whatwg.org)

[00:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
good thing i've been logging every packet sent out from my network

[00:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me delves into the packet logs to see who this is

[01:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me got one of his other neighbours to stop using his network very suddenly by redirecting all his web traffic to a short page noting that he knew the person's name... right bang in the middle of that person browsing cross-dresser support forums.

[01:03:00.0000] <jruderman>
support as in technical support or support as in moral support?

[01:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
both, actually

[01:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
he was shopping for fake breast inserts

[01:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
and browsing sites about people's first public outting as their "other" personality

[01:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
i should point out i have nothing against cross-dressers

[01:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
and didn't even mention this in the message

[01:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
but they stopped so suddenly, i think they may have been freaked out a little

[01:05:01.0000] <jruderman>
you just have something against other people using your network?

[01:05:02.0000] <jruderman>
or using it too heavily?

[01:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
(i actually didn't realise what they were doing when i put up the message, only found out later when checking the logs more carefully)

[01:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
just too heavily

[01:05:05.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems that our FAQ doesn't explain why HTML5 and XHTML2 are separate

[01:05:06.0000] <webben_>
annevk: Thanks :) And yeah, I do need some sort of useful-info-in-email-preservation approach, and not just for html5-related things. ;)

[01:05:07.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, dunno about the TAG thread, though it seems Noah thinks there is more legacy in tools than in content?

jruderman: if i notice they are using it, then they're using it too heavily. then i start looking. :-)

[01:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: basically, i provide it as a public service for people who want to check their e-mail while at a party, or who want to contact comcast to set up their own network

[01:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: if they're browsing porn... or downloading HD movies... they can get their own network

does Prince support gzip?

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/script/011-demo.html shows firefox has really weird content-type parsing

[01:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not the simple algorithm in the spec (or in webkit) but it's not the spec's proper algorithm either

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
opera is per spec, it seems

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk>
HTTP?

[02:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[02:03:00.0000] <annevk>
some browser has to care about the standards I suppose 8-)

[02:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what happened to Mr. This Week?

[02:05:00.0000] <annevk>
/me asks on twitter

[02:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: I have http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/stats/scripttypes2.html which I *think* is script content-types, but it's from so long ago that I can't quite remember

[02:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
he's fine

[02:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
just been taking a break because i haven't done much

[02:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
he said he'd probably start again next week or so

[02:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: looking...

[02:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: awesome, thanks

[02:16:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe I should update html5-diff today so that we can publish sooner rather than later

[02:17:00.0000] <annevk>
though digging through SVN back to June last year is not so attractive

[03:00:00.0000] <Philip`>

/me tries Firefox nightly (3.2a1pre) on Windows, and finds that it's incredibly slow at rendering his font test page

[03:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
like it takes about twenty seconds to load all the fonts

a friend of mine got bitten by someone actually implementing RFC 3023 :-(

[03:34:00.0000] <annevk>
did he have to go to the hospital?

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
do they have shots for that?

[03:37:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, HTML5 content sniffing :p

[03:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I gather there are t-shirts

[03:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's wrong with 3023 again? just the text/xml charset nonsense?

[03:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yes

[03:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i've been forgetting to mark recent changes as applying to conformance checkers, sorry

[03:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok. I'll review the changes more closely

[03:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
in particular, 2675 and 2697 probably affect you.

[03:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's strange how much less correct code looks after you wait until the next day and then look at it again

[04:19:00.0000] <annevk>
/me notices an instance of "(blame: hs)" rather than "(credit: hs)" and laughs

[04:38:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, html5-diff is a WD

[04:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds a second bug in Font::TTF, which is pretty good going so far

[04:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me supposes that's an advantage of using a library that's more than a decade old

[04:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does Opera 10 support the new name for <eventsource>?

[04:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk, karlcow: At what point do you have to decide if a WD will become a TR or a Note?

[04:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: wouldn't it be non-sensical to make it a REC?

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: assuming you meant REC. (Notes are under /TR/, too.)

[04:44:01.0000] <karlcow>
jgraham: any point.

[04:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I was under the impression that some people had suggested making the Markup Spec normative

[04:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I though you meant the diff document

[04:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/Markup Spec/HTML 5 The Markup Language"

[04:46:02.0000] <karlcow>
TR Process is a publication process architectured around a technology and its maturation. What people fail to understand often, that there is no exit criteria from one step to the other, but *entrance criteria*

[04:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: is there any way in the Process for marking a WD dead if it fall out of charter or the owning group decides against advancing it?

[04:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: for example, is there a way to flag the Web Forms 2.0 dead as a separate document?

[04:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Wow! I found a situation where the GPOS table actually does something visible

[04:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
Specifically, spacing of "VA" and "To" in Libertine and Deja Vu fonts on Windows only

[04:50:02.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, you usually state the intent upfront

[04:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and only in Firefox, not in IE)

[04:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: yeah, there's something fishy going on if the intent of REC vs. Note isn't stated up front

[04:51:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, we should simply redirect the web-forms-2 shortname to html5 when we publish a new draft

[04:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: how does that work regarding cross-platform line breaking in OOo?

[04:52:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I suppose we should e-mail someone about that to make sure it happens though

[04:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I would imagine such things are inconsistent across platforms

[06:01:00.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: draft ideas are never dead :) luckily enough :) 

[06:03:00.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: nothing fishy. Strange way of conceiving the evolution of ideas and life of things. It is a bit like if you were saying "wow this guy is not saying up front if he wants to become the director of the company or a developer in this company". 

[06:04:00.0000] <karlcow>
Things evolve, change. It is not binary and deterministic.

[06:11:00.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: >For years, HTML4 validation wasn't improved at all. Validator.nu, Validome and Relaxed have now improved on things but are still seen as illegitimate compared to DTD-based HTML4 validation.

[06:11:01.0000] <karlcow>
this is quite ironic

[06:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, in what way is that ironic?

[06:12:01.0000] <karlcow>
for years, w3c has asked people for help, but people prefer to create their own competing services more than improving the one in place. :) The way you tell the story gives an interesting twist to what is happening

[06:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: I think we've had this discussion before. Technical improvements required a total engine swap and coming into a project from the outside advocating a total engine swap wouldn't have been socially feasible without first demonstrating technical merit elsewhere.

[06:46:00.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: which is a complete different take on your email.

[07:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: part of the problem were the people who held the line "validation has a clear and precise meaning. it's parsing without DTD-based errors. nothing more, nothing less"

[07:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: (in the community around the W3C validator)

[07:03:01.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: your pushing the discussion elsewhere

[07:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: I thought I pushed it back to normative schemas (DTDs in the case of HTML4)

[07:04:01.0000] <karlcow>
the same will happen to your validator if the community decide to make it the emblem of html 5 validation. Unfortunately not your choice, power of the crowd

[07:10:00.0000] <annevk>
idea: create a XHTML2 versus HTML5 wiki page discussing XHTML2 chapter by chapter, saying how HTML5 handles the particular feature and what the rationale was doing it that way

[07:10:01.0000] <annevk>
/me hopes to work on that at some point

[07:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or the other way around?

[07:13:00.0000] <annevk>
then I wouldn't find out what XHTML2 does and HTML5 doesn't

[07:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
true

[07:13:02.0000] <annevk>
but someone could create a HTML5 versus XHTML2 page, sure :)

[07:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd rather see the effort spent of improving Lachy's authoring guide, for example

[07:16:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, I don't think I'm a good tutorial author

[07:17:00.0000] <annevk>
writing books and such is best done before being an expert, according to markp anyway

[07:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if markp considers himself to past the point of being able to write Dive into HTML5.

[07:19:00.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: yes it is a nice idea

[07:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
I should have the time to get back to working on the authoing guide soon

[07:19:02.0000] <annevk>
also, to be honest, I think DanC's approach is better

[07:19:03.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: it is difficult to work on Lachy tutorial

[07:19:04.0000] <annevk>
what he outlined anyway

[07:19:05.0000] <karlcow>
agreed with annevk 

[07:19:06.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: why?

[07:19:07.0000] <Lachy>
what's DanC's apparoch?

[07:19:08.0000] <hsivonen>
where's DanC's outline?

[07:20:00.0000] <karlcow>
because it is not a tutorial.

[07:20:01.0000] <annevk>
/me looks

[07:20:02.0000] <karlcow>
it is not about explaining use cases and how to solve them

[07:20:03.0000] <karlcow>
with html5

[07:20:04.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/att-0274/html-writing-ideas.html

[07:21:00.0000] <karlcow>
I was tempted to start from scratch but have been holding it back by the friction that it would create with Lachy 

[07:21:01.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0274.html is the e-mail that goes with it

[07:21:02.0000] <karlcow>
s/by/because of

[07:21:03.0000] <Lachy>
how is that outline significantly different from what my authoing guide will be?

[07:22:00.0000] <annevk>
see the e-mail

[07:23:00.0000] <karlcow>
simple bits did that in the past 

[07:23:01.0000] <karlcow>
http://www.simplebits.com/publications/solutions/toc/

[07:23:02.0000] <karlcow>
and it was quite cool

[07:23:03.0000] <karlcow>
unfortunately he removed the content when the book was ready

[07:23:04.0000] <karlcow>
more than saying this is a ul and how to use it

[07:23:05.0000] <karlcow>
it was on the form

[07:23:06.0000] <karlcow>
How do I do lists in documents

[07:24:00.0000] <karlcow>
what is a quote and how do I use it

[07:24:01.0000] <karlcow>
etc

[07:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
I'm still not getting what the difference is. Perhaps my view of what the guide will be doesn't quite match up with what people think I doing withit

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish a guide didn't try to dumb things down and started boldly with the concept of a document tree

[07:25:01.0000] <karlcow>
Lachy: the way I look at your document for now is what the Markup Spec is doing somehow. An inventory of vocabulary

[07:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. Lachy's doc does mention the tree early on, but doesn't illustrate it in detail

[07:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i seem to remember doing just fine making pages without knowing what the DOM was

[07:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, ok. I think I need to create a clearer outline so people can put what's currently in the document, in perspective of everything it will contain

[07:27:02.0000] <zcorpan>
at least until i started to do scripting

[07:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can still do quite a bit of scripting without knowing anything about a document tree

[07:28:01.0000] <zcorpan>
indeed

[07:28:02.0000] <karlcow>
Lachy: sincerely I would dump everything about the vocabulary inventory

[07:28:03.0000] <karlcow>
this should be the last thing

[07:28:04.0000] <karlcow>
not the first one

[07:28:05.0000] <Philip`>
document.getElementById('foo').setAttribute('style', 'text-decoration: blink') and all that stuff

[07:28:06.0000] <zcorpan>
i also remember that the DOM was just confusing and irrelevant before learning it

[07:28:07.0000] <Philip`>
Also you can do a lot of CSS without knowing about trees, just by referring to everything directly with element names and class names

[07:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, having a description of the vocabulary is the most important part, IMHO

[07:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
we shouldn't need to refer authors to the spec just to get the vocabulary

[07:31:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, maybe if you have a CS background "tree" makes sense, if you're still in high school you just want to know how to get a webpage online :)

[07:32:00.0000] <karlcow>
well exactly why I have not been working on it ;) I indeed prefer the document proposed by danc

[07:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
DanC's outline clearly incldues a whole section covering the vocabulary. I don't see the difference

[07:32:02.0000] <annevk>
have you read his e-mail?

[07:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[07:33:01.0000] <annevk>
to me it indicates he's planning on writing separate tutorials on how to do various things, such as putting a video online

[07:34:00.0000] <annevk>
i think that's vastly different from a spec that describes the HTML5 vocabulary

[07:34:01.0000] <karlcow>
yes

[07:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
describing the vocabulary is just part of the guide. I also intended to describe use cases like that

[07:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
the way I see it, it's all related and having DanC work on a separate document, rather than just contributing to the one we already have is pointless

[07:37:00.0000] <annevk>
you still can't see how your approach is different? having everything in the same doc is vastly different from having lots of little tutorials

[07:39:00.0000] <annevk>
and I can't at all see why you'd consider it pointless, if he writes something and it's good, you can always borrow it if the WG decides to make an authoring guide

[07:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems logistically easier to have separate people working on separate documents (as long as they're not duplicating each others' work), and later the documents that end up being good can be focussed on and maybe made more consistent and merged together

[07:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't see why it should be done in a separate document. He's welcome to write stuff though

[07:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps we can just merge them later though, once I actually see a more concrete proposal

[07:42:00.0000] <annevk>
the reason it should be in a separate document is because that makes it more approachable to authors

[07:42:01.0000] <annevk>
concretely, "HOWTO put video on the Web" is more approachable than "HTML5 Authoring Guide" (and also a lot smaller and readable within a few minutes)

[07:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
alright, I suppose we can make both documents compliment each other

[07:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
will the video be Ogg?

[07:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, if DanC's document will follow the cookbook approach, which isn't impression I get from either his outline or his email, then I can accept that

[07:54:00.0000] <annevk>
http://groups.google.com/group/demon.homepages.authoring/browse_thread/thread/ccdef4ff7b26c4ca

[08:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
LOL. It's been a while since I've read that :-)

[08:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
the <cowpats> element would be quite useful for some people :-)

[08:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How about <cowpath> to enclose content you feel should be made part of the next spec iteration? :)

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: But what markup would you use to indicate that you feel <cowpath> should be made part of the next spec iteration?

[08:17:01.0000] <Dashiva>
<div class="cowpath"> obviously

[08:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, the Libertine font has a section saying that any glyph in the range 1945..1964 should (in certain situations) be replaced by the glyph with an index 20 places earlier. But I'm removing arbitrary glyphs and reordering them all, so I can't use the same delta for each, so this seems pretty much impossible to handle :-(

[09:53:00.0000] <annevk>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/XHTML2_versus_HTML5 has a start of my idea

[09:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk has an idea? Oh shit.

[09:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should make an 'XHTML2 versus HTML5' version of http://coop.sigkill.com/~preed/people.mozilla.com/~preed/bloggity-blog-blog/vcs-shootout3.jpg

[10:42:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, XHTML2 has a layout="" attribute

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
<table layout="layout">?

[10:44:01.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2009/ED-xhtml-modularization2-20090123/mod-core.html

[10:45:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2009/ED-xhtml-modularization2-20090123/mod-hyperAttributes.html in XHTML2 defines some user agent processing in a strikingly similar manner to HTML5

[10:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So then with @layout the element hasLayout?

[10:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
the layout attribute is their method of  making every element behave like <pre>

[10:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Does xml:space do that?

[10:53:02.0000] <Lachy>
no

[10:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
The layout attribute doesn't unless you also use xml:space, as far as I can tell

[10:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
(because otherwise some of the space will get normalised after coming out of the XML parser)

[10:55:00.0000] <annevk>
XHTML2 is such a poor spec

[10:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
from XML spec: "The value "default" [for xml:space] signals that applications' default white-space processing modes are acceptable for this element"

[10:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
it doesn't seem to say what the default white-space processing mode is. It seems to be application dependent

[10:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
AFAICT, the xml:space attribute has no effect on the parser

[10:58:00.0000] <annevk>
the table stuff is just a copy of HTML4, including the "A graphical user agent might render this as:" with a screen shot from an age old user agent

[10:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
heh

[11:02:00.0000] <annevk>
can't believe people are using XHTML2 in arguments, even hypothetical ones

[11:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
who is?

[11:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
do you mean on one of the mailing lists, or in general?

[11:05:00.0000] <annevk>
general

[11:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. that explains why I didn't see any such arguments on the list recently

[11:06:01.0000] <annevk>
anyway, it still seems semi-useful to explore it for markup ideas and document that somehow

[11:06:02.0000] <annevk>
also means I have some place to point to when anyone asks

[11:13:00.0000] <annevk>
http://twitter.com/diveintomark/status/1142232859 :p

[11:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Is it undesirable for me to have validator.nu say "Internal Error: Oops. That was not supposed to happen. A bug manifested itself in the application internals. Unable to continue. Sorry. The admin was notified."?

[12:20:00.0000] <annevk>
http://twitter.com/robburns1

[12:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
who does he think is only looking at XHTML2 for the first time?

[12:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: annevk 

[12:23:00.0000] <annevk>
he obviously never heard of Google

[12:23:01.0000] <annevk>
http://www.google.com/search?q=site:annevankesteren.nl+xhtml2

[12:31:00.0000] <annevk>
WHATWG blog still uses XHTML 1.0 Transitional

[12:31:01.0000] <annevk>
:)

[12:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether to tweet how he feels

[12:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it wise to constrain your feelings to 140 characters?

[12:57:01.0000] <jcranmer>
Philip`: I feel... complex

[12:57:02.0000] <jcranmer>
:-)

[13:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Oh, I can easily live within that limit.

[13:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: The question is how do I word it vague enough for nobody to get who it is about but not have it so vague that it's meaning is obscured

[13:04:00.0000] <krijnh>
-_-

[13:04:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[13:04:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Also, it probably isn't as bad as that makes it sound.)

[13:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: If you don't actually want anybody to know what you're feeling, maybe it's easier to not express it at all :-)

[13:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray, now Firefox renders Arabic in a subsetted Deja Vu Sans more correctly

[13:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me probably has millions of bugs in this code, but the output looks alright in his tests so he's just going to leave it for now

[13:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, your last tweet was quite vague.

[13:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Quote from Ada or Ardor

[13:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
who are they?

[13:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I would've tweeted the next sentence too, but that would've made it too long

[13:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
s/Ada or Ardor/"Ada or Ardor"

[13:16:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Novel, by Vladimir Nabokov

[13:16:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[13:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The next sentence is, off hand, "But a butterfly in the Park, an orchid in a shop window, would revive everything with a dazzling inward shock of despair."

[13:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
well, I'm waiting in suspence to see if you can top the vagueness with your next tweet

[13:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Vagueness is not the aim of the next tweet. Not revealing who it is about is the aim. :)

[13:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
is it about that same girl you tweeted about yesterday?

[13:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
What did I tweet yesterday?

[13:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[13:20:03.0000] <Lachy>
http://twitter.com/gsnedders/status/1137360266

[13:20:04.0000] <gsnedders>
That was two days ago.

[13:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
No, nothing to do with her.

[13:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://twitter.com/gsnedders/status/1137514005 is about her too.

[13:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
it says 8:36 yesterday

[13:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Nothing more than that needs to be said

[13:21:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: You and your wacky timezones

[13:21:05.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I figured that much

[13:21:06.0000] <Lachy>
My timezone is only about an hour or so different from yours

[13:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
must be twitter using US time

[13:22:01.0000] <annevk>
but twitter.com probably isn't

[13:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It was around 48 hours ago

[13:22:03.0000] <gsnedders>
"You want the honest answer? I still want you. Time changes nothing." — That's the draft I have of the next tweet, minus the last sentence. I fear the last sentence will give it away.

[13:23:00.0000] <krijnh>
You can say it here.. I'll take the logs offline for you ;)

[13:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[13:23:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Whatever you say krijnh, whatever you say :)

[13:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: The "@Hixie:" would give it away too

[13:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[13:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
This person doesn't have Twitter.

[13:25:01.0000] <krijnh>
You can use [off]

[13:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That works in here too?

[13:25:03.0000] <gsnedders>
[off] foobar

[13:25:04.0000] <krijnh>
Oh, it doesn't

[13:25:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I thought #webapps was special cased

[13:25:06.0000] <gsnedders>
And the logs would tend to confirm that

[13:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can't hide your feelings here! we're radically open and transparent!

[13:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
sweet, danc is going to take some of my work off my hands

[13:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Okay okay okay… The truth! I'm not gay.

[13:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, we know that much

[13:27:01.0000] <krijnh>
We do?

[13:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
krijnh: See tweets linked a few minutes ago

[13:27:03.0000] <Lachy>
well, the way he obsesses over girls he thinks he can never have is a big giveaway

[13:28:00.0000] <krijnh>
gsnedders: sorry, I don't care enough about you being gay or not ;)

[13:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
obsesses is too strong of a word.

[13:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok, if you say so

[13:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:D

[13:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe he only obsesses over the girls because he's already getting the boys

[13:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
is she someone you are freinds with, or just someone from school you like, who hangs out with different people?

[13:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, the friends I spend most of my time with are all girls and I fit in far too well so I do get called gay far too often

[13:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: no comment.

[13:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me will not be cross-examined about this here

[13:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(At least insofar as who the draft is about)

[13:30:03.0000] <krijnh>
One disadvantage of bringing it up

[13:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
krijnh: I'm used to a group of very inquisitive girls questioning me about such things. I'm sure I can manage.

[13:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, that's what I thought when I was your age. But somehow, people used to get all sorts of information from me I didn't want to reveal

[13:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I can be very quiet if I want to be :)

[13:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Choosing to be quiet is an act that reveals information too

[13:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No, it isn't my sister.

[13:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[13:34:02.0000] <takkaria>
choosing to be quier is not an act per se

[13:34:03.0000] <gsnedders>
"If you choose not to decide/You still have made a choice"

[13:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
takkaria: How is it not an act?

[13:36:00.0000] <takkaria>
an act generally has some positive element

[13:36:01.0000] <takkaria>
e.g. it is an act rather than choosing to be inactive

[13:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: As for not giving stuff away, I haven't yet given away the gender of who it is about

[13:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's like if you're sending secret encrypted instructions to an undercover agent in an enemy country and then suddenly stop sending anything at all, and that act will give information to an eavesdropper that might let them deduce the agent is no longer active

[13:39:00.0000] <annevk>
once gsnedders does HTML2RFC I can attempt to register about:

[13:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: I refuse.

[13:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I have henceforth said I will not write html2rfc, and I have no intent on changing that POV.

[13:40:00.0000] <annevk>
:/

[13:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
How about html2rfcxml?

[13:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i can send you my script

[13:40:03.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, it's either a girl, or a boy you refer to as "her". My guess is that it's not the latter.

[13:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: but you'll have to hack it

[13:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: When did I refer to them as "her"?

[13:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
"I want to be with her so badly, but I know she'll never have me."

[13:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
or are you talking about someone else now?

[13:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: I've already said it had nothing to do with her.

[13:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[13:42:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[13:42:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(She does, inadvertently, know who this is about.)

[13:42:05.0000] <gsnedders>
(And would probably get it from the vague draft I quoted above.)

[13:42:06.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I'm not too great with Perl

[13:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Go learn.

[13:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: who is

[13:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: thanks for the templates btw

[13:43:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: np

[13:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: http://damowmow.com/temp/html-to-rfc.txt

[13:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's more generic that i remember

[13:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
basically you give it the ID of an <h4>, and it extracts that section and its subsections

[13:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Every time I look at Perl I just think "oh god"

[13:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what would an I-D to register the about: URI scheme need to say?

[13:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
"about:blank returns the empty string"

[13:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think that might be it!

[13:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess it would have to define valid values of about:...

[13:47:04.0000] <Lachy>
heh

[13:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
and what they represent

[13:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
some history

[13:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
some mention of the security implications of the origin of about:Blank

[13:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
and how it must be done like html5 says

[13:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
or something

[13:48:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Because HTML 5 is awesome.

[13:48:06.0000] <Philip`>
Presumably about:sgml-compat (or whatever it was going to be) would have to be defined as valid somewhere too

[13:48:07.0000] <Lachy>
ok. If it's not too difficult, I could write something up this weekend if I get motivated

[13:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Just use the XML format to write an RFC from scratch

[13:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It works fine.

[13:49:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I think only about:blank would need to be defined in the I-D. about:sgml-compat is just like any other. Any vendor or spec can mint their own about URIs

[13:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Would that need some IANA registry?

[13:51:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, yeah I see, not too difficult, although the XML format looks rather simple too

[13:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me stretches his legs

[13:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know how to handle that. Since vendors should be able to freely mint their own about URIs as needed, but then it might be reasonable to require specs to register them

[13:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: It is.

[13:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
though if we go down the registry route, I can see people complaining about the potential for clashes

[13:52:01.0000] <annevk>
can't we just say that about:<anything> is ok and that it's up to the "application layer" to say what happens and then HTML5 says what to do for about:blank

[13:53:00.0000] <annevk>
in the navigation section

[13:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd rather not

[13:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's not really saying anything

[13:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
and we might end up with conflicting results

[13:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
is there an IANA registry of URI schemes somewhere?

[13:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
found it http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes.html

[14:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if anything uses the 'kern' tables in OpenType

[14:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't kerning a pretty big deal in making fonts look pretty?

[14:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes, but it seems everyone uses the GPOS table for that, rather than the kern table

[14:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Libertine has a 0.75MB kern table, but if I delete the table then I can't see any difference for any text in any browser

[14:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe it's used by font editing software to generate/update gpos :)

[14:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
kern is much more limited than GPOS, since it can only do pairs rather than arbitrary sequences, so that probably wouldn't be a terribly sane thing to do :-)

[14:18:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm out of ideas then

[14:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
The documentation just says "Windows v3.1 does not make use of the 'kern' data other than to expose it to applications through the GetFontData() API.Format 2"

[14:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
using urn:w3c:sgml-compat like Larry suggests, instead of about:sgml-compat could work.

[14:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
it's only mildly longer and almost as memorable

[14:28:00.0000] <annevk>
then use data:,sgml-compat

[14:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
sounds more formal

[14:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
i prefer about:sgml-compat personally

[14:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
data:,sgml-compat looks messy enough though :-)

[14:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
though that would confuse actual DTD-based processors somewhat :-)

[14:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, data URIs are messy. it's likely people will forget the comma

[14:31:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, they'd be in violation of HTTP!

[14:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
HTTP?

[14:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
I like about:sgml-compat too. But can't think of any good reason to object to the urn:

[14:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the objection to about: ?

[14:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's shorter and simpler and looks less magical.

[14:33:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, trying to interpret a text/plain resource as DTD

[14:33:03.0000] <Lachy>
personally, I don't have an objection to about:

[14:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: that's not HTTP, that's MIME, but yeah, good point.

[14:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd is served as text/plain

[14:41:00.0000] <annevk>
oooh, news at eleven, w3.org has bugs :p

[14:41:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Do what I publish, not what I do

[14:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, what bugs?

[14:42:01.0000] <annevk>
/me blinks

[14:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
my point was that serving a DTD as text/plain is ok

[14:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
application/xml-dtd is for XML DTDs only, not SGML DTDs, or fake DTDs

[14:43:01.0000] <annevk>
and that means they should use text/plain?

[14:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
what else should they use?

[14:44:01.0000] <annevk>
something unregistered?

[14:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
application/sgml maybe, which is registered

[14:45:00.0000] <annevk>
if content sniffing is bad, you can't put resources online as text/plain and expected them to be handled as anything but text

[14:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
meh

[14:50:00.0000] <annevk>
now personally I'm not sure content sniffing is bad and frankly the amount of effort it requires to get font/ttf and font/otf seems to be high so we'll probably be stuck with content sniffing for fonts

[14:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
there's no way we're going to be able to avoid content sniffing for fonts.

[14:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, it's not really content sniffing. It's more like treating anything retrieved from @font-face src will be treated as a font

[14:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: The sensible thing is to send no content-type

[14:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, the problem is that Apache sends a content type by default. Usually text/plain for unknown types

[14:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Then application/octet-stream

[14:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's what I used when I made those @font-face TC's the other day

[15:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, does that mean you're not going to rewrite the introduction for my draft?

[15:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Unless you really really really want me to, yes

[15:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok


2009-01-24
[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
hahahahha

[16:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
wakaba_ calls the U01234 notation that hsivonen and I came up with the "Uhhhhh" notation

[16:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
I love it

[16:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Uh?

[16:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[16:38:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, last checkin uses a double dot to end a sentence

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: which sentence?

[17:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
found it

[18:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow are you seeing this ietf-http-wg thread?

[18:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: CSRF?

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[18:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think roy just said "i am always right"

[18:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
"i need no evidence"

[18:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I think so too.

[18:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray, now all my fonts work with no reported conversion errors and no reported parsing errors from Pango and no visual difference from the original fonts in any browser as far as I can see

[18:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i should ask vint cerf to weigh in on the discussion and say "well with my 30 years of experience with the Internet, I outrank you"

[18:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
with all the kerning and ligatures and positioning-acute-accents-over-'i'-so-it-lines-up-with-the-dot and stacking half a dozen diacritics on top of each other and doing Arabic and all that stuff

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: nice

[18:21:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: Disregarding how productive (or not) it would be, it would be awesome 

[18:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
and I've only found four bugs in Font::TTF, which is still pretty good

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: if only i wasn't concerned about wasting his time :-)

[18:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
But this is much more painful than I initially expected it to be :-(

[18:22:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: He's spent 16 years on this, I'm sure a few minutes can sneak past :P

[18:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: i meant vint's time

[18:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But yeah, probably no point in getting into an argument over who has the most weight on an irrelevant scale

[18:24:01.0000] <annevk>
His argument about changing Referer is somewhat appealing, though I suppose getting those proxies updated will be hard.

[18:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
He hasn't addressed path information in referer that I can see

[18:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
his whole argument is spurious. authors can't rely on referer or origin, but when they see origin, they can use it as a hard-and-fast rule. with referer, they can't ever do that.

[18:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
the whole point isn't to fix every browser or every server, it's to make it possible for server-browser combinations to be safer

[18:27:00.0000] <jruderman>
Philip`: i'm not a fan of text engines letting you stack a dozen diacritics on top of each other. it's kind of a security hole.

[18:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
jruderman: What makes it a security hole?

[18:27:02.0000] <jruderman>
Philip`: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=288292 and https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=supercombiner 

[18:27:03.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure I like the way how Adam did the draft. I would have preferred that when or when not Origin is included is stated somewhere else (e.g. in CORS). Currently it seems to introduce a change as with his draft even same origin requests would contain the Origin header, though maybe that is a good thing...

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: tell him

[18:28:01.0000] <jruderman>
Philip`: lets you make stuff unreadable when you're only supposed to be able to stick in a line of text

[18:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: cc me or the whatwg list

[18:28:03.0000] <Philip`>
jruderman: Ah, right

[18:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i can back you up if he disagrees :-)

[18:28:05.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, yeah, I will do it when I'm more awake :)

[18:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me realises that despite all the fancy typographic effects working correctly, he's still got a font which renders ")" upside-down :-(

[18:31:00.0000] <jruderman>
how do you know it's upside-down? isn't it symmetric wrt vertical flips?

[18:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe the vertical positioning changes when it's upside down

[18:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
I mean it's rotated 180 degrees

[18:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think it's actually the '(' glyph that's meant to be rotated by 180 degrees but isn't rotated at all

[18:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There's no actual ) glyph, just a copy instruction?

[18:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
The ')' glyph is a composite glyph, whose single component is the '(' glyph, and supposedly with some rotational transform that seems to be disappearing in my conversion process

[18:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wish these file formats hadn't been designed for 16-bit Windows where you had approximately zero RAM

[19:05:00.0000] <annevk>
and Adam pwns Roy again

[19:05:01.0000] <annevk>
now it's really bedtime :)

[19:05:02.0000] <annevk>
nn

[19:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
adam is shockingly good at this

[19:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: what characteristic makes them suitable for zero ram?

[19:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: There's things like a ARG_1_AND_2_ARE_WORDS flag which means the next two values in the structure are stored as 2-byte values rather than 1-byte values, and scale transforms can be stored as 1 or 2 or 4 values depending on some other flags

[19:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
presumably all to save a tiny bit of space

[19:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me fixes two more bugs in Font::TTF, and now his bracket works correctly

[19:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
aah

[19:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/demos/font/tests.html

[19:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Firefox definitely wins on quality, as far as I can tell)

[19:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
(But annoyingly the Essays1743 font has now stopped working on Windows, after I fixed it to preserve the -1 scale on ')')

[19:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, actually, that's not true, I think it's never worked)

[19:34:01.0000] <wakaba_>
hi Hixie

[19:35:00.0000] <wakaba_>
about my mail (s/FDDF/FDEF/g (noncharacter code points).)

[19:35:01.0000] <wakaba_>
In http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/parsing.html#preprocessing-the-input-stream

[19:35:02.0000] <wakaba_>
U+FDD0 to U+FDDF are parse errors, but U+FDE0 to U+FDEF are also noncharacter

[19:36:00.0000] <wakaba_>
see http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFB50.pdf

[20:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow what kind of crazy character is U+FDFD

[20:58:00.0000] <heycam>
why "ARABIC LIGATURE BISMILLAH AR-RAHMAN AR-RAHEEM" of course :)

[20:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
have you seen the canonical rendering?!

[20:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
jesus

[20:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
wakaba_: thanks

[20:59:00.0000] <heycam>
/me looks at the glyph in the above pdf

[20:59:01.0000] <heycam>
it must be a phrase or something?

[21:00:00.0000] <heycam>
seems no crazier than the Zapfino glyph :)

[21:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
Zapfino isn't one Unicode character!

[21:02:00.0000] <gavin>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basmala

[21:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: crashed webkit :-)

[21:03:00.0000] <heycam>
ah, interesting

[00:59:00.0000] <roc>
Philip`: ouch, you crashed ATSUI!

[00:59:01.0000] <roc>
perhaps the same crash that Hixie saw with Webkit, if he's on Mac

[01:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: roc: That doesn't sound good

[01:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'll blame Apple :-)

[01:42:02.0000] <roc>
yeah

[01:42:03.0000] <roc>
we have discovered other crashing bugs in ATSUI

[01:42:04.0000] <roc>
Apple's response was "use the Core Text APIs instead"

[01:42:05.0000] <roc>
which aren't supported in 10.4, but oh well

[01:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think these aren't even invalid font files now (except maybe a tiny litle bit)

[01:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
*little

[01:43:02.0000] <roc>
it doesn't matter, the bad guys can send invalid font files

[01:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems to work alright in Safari on Windows, though the combining diacritics completely mess up the actual layout and make everything overlap

[01:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if the bug should be reported or something

[01:58:00.0000] <roc>
which bug?

[01:58:01.0000] <roc>
the last ATSUI crasher bug we reported, via our super-duper paid support channel, was rejected with "Use Core Text intead"

[02:00:00.0000] <jruderman>
roc: so we can't even *pay* apple to fix its security bugs?

[02:00:01.0000] <roc>
I don't think we presented it as a security bug

[02:00:02.0000] <jruderman>
oh

[02:00:03.0000] <jruderman>
well, was it a security bug?

[02:00:04.0000] <roc>
hard to tell

[02:00:05.0000] <roc>
no source remember

[02:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
If it crashes WebKit too, I guess that's something Apple has to fix regardless of what APIs they use internally

[02:01:01.0000] <roc>
I hope that if we had an exploit, we could force them to fix it

[02:01:02.0000] <roc>
Philip`: they could switch Webkit to use Core Text

[02:02:00.0000] <roc>
we have a patch for that, it was just a couple of weeks of work (for someone very experienced and smart, anyway)

[02:02:01.0000] <roc>
We'll probably have that in FF3.2 for Leopard users

[02:03:00.0000] <roc>
no doubt Core Text has its own bugs, but hopefully they'll fix those

[02:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
Or they'll tell you to use the new incompatible text API in 10.6

[02:04:00.0000] <jruderman>
Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) itself will probably be out of security support by the time we ship firefox 3.2

[02:04:01.0000] <jruderman>
Philip`: hehe

[02:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, it's a kind of random crash, which makes it hard to work out what characters are causing it :-(

[02:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but it seems to be the Doulos SIL font)

[02:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, looks like it's breaking on the input i\x{0331}

[03:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/tests/font/atsui-kern-crash.html

[03:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
That seems to be about as reliable as I can make it

[03:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
and it crashes WebKit and Firefox

[03:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
(in the latest nightlies)

[03:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
and it crashes Opera too

[03:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
(all only on OS X)

[03:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
and I can't see anything I'm doing wrong, so I can't think of any workaround I could implement :-(

[04:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Hmph, OS X doesn't like my GPOS tables)

[04:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders when the pain will end

[05:32:00.0000] <annevk>
I was wondering, for menus, would it be fine to just have <nav> <a ...>...</a> <a ...>...</a> ... </nav> ?

[05:32:01.0000] <annevk>
would remove a lot of cruft

[05:33:00.0000] <annevk>
it doesn't really state that lists are supposed to be used in HTML5, though there is an example to that effect and lists have been used traditionally

[05:49:00.0000] <annevk>
hey cool, the other Ian from Google I met a few times joined the WG

[05:53:00.0000] <annevk>

[05:53:01.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xhtml2/2009Jan/0064.html

[05:57:00.0000] <takkaria>
wow, a new xhtml2 draft too

[05:57:01.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/2009/01/21-xhtml-minutes.html is also interesting

[05:57:02.0000] <annevk>
takkaria, yeah, there are some new features in it since last TR draft it seems, though it's also quite broken and incomplete

[05:58:00.0000] <annevk>
apparently they replace <script charset> with <script encoding> which takes a comma-separated list so that it's more useful than HTML4?!

[05:58:01.0000] <annevk>
wtf, the only reason charset is there is to override the encoding of the script (if that's not defined); it's a hack

[06:00:00.0000] <annevk>
and with all their focus on being backwards compatible they still have things such as "... from a processing point of virew, img and span are identical"

[06:00:01.0000] <annevk>
and then still deliver it as text/html, how anyone can even consider this plan remotely sane is beyond me

[06:01:00.0000] <takkaria>
they're saying you can serve as text/html?

[06:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
"Steven: If we say that @lang has no meaning, it wouldn't actually break anything"

[06:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think that illustrates priorities rather aptly

[06:02:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, it's hilarious

[06:04:00.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xhtml2/2009Jan/0073.html

[06:05:00.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xhtml2/2009Jan/0074.html (about lang and xml:lang)

[06:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if lang is the one that works, getting rid of xml:lang seems to be the sensible thing to do

[06:07:00.0000] <takkaria>
their priority of constituencies rule is different

[06:07:01.0000] <takkaria>
consider theoretical purity over specifiers over implementers

[06:09:00.0000] <annevk>
seems to me they're just buiding a toy language

[06:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like they are using http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml as the namespace for XHTML2

[06:13:00.0000] <annevk>
/me is reminded of http://annevankesteren.nl/2003/07/xhtml-20-spec-summary :)

[06:13:01.0000] <annevk>
"but XHTML2.0 has http://www.w3.org/2002/06/xhtml2 and that's very unlikely to change"

[06:14:00.0000] <annevk>
also http://www.goer.org/Journal/2003/07/index.html#04 "XHTML2 is a big specification (430 KB and counting)"

[06:14:01.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/tracker/actions/44

[06:14:02.0000] <karlcow>
:)

[06:15:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me wonders what would be the content of this

[06:17:00.0000] <takkaria>
do the XHTML2 people intend to get implementors to implement the spec at some point?

[06:18:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm not quite sure what their strategy is there

[06:18:01.0000] <annevk>
they implement things in three schema languages

[06:19:00.0000] <annevk>
karlcow, me too... we'll see I suppose; it seems they mostly discuss things in telcons so I suppose it might take a while before they get there

[06:21:00.0000] <annevk>
takkaria, there are some plug-ins too, I think, e.g. sidewinder or whatever the name was

[06:21:01.0000] <karlcow>
takkaria: "implementors" is a very wide definition. Yes I'm pretty sure they already have implementors working on it, but maybe they are not the implementers which matter to you, aka different communities.

[06:21:02.0000] <annevk>
aka not relevant on the Web :p

[06:22:00.0000] <karlcow>
I didn't say that ;) and do not agree with the hsivonen definition of the Web ;)

[06:23:00.0000] <annevk>
I think he was misunderstood

[06:23:01.0000] <karlcow>
takkaria: a sure fact that is XHTML 2 is not implemented in Safari, Opera, Firefox and IE, as far as I know.

[06:25:00.0000] <karlcow>
ouch bad english as usual.

[06:25:01.0000] <karlcow>
/me reboots his brain serializer

[06:27:00.0000] <annevk>
karlcow, though now they base it on the XHTML namespace it suddenly "works"

[06:28:00.0000] <karlcow>
:D

[06:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's the magical power of namespaces!

[06:30:00.0000] <myakura>
though some incompatible changes has been made throught the spec. like <img> can has now content!

[06:30:01.0000] <karlcow>
I was not for this change of namespace. It is unfortunate because I think he does more harm to namespaces by diluting their meaning

[06:30:02.0000] <karlcow>
unfortunately

[06:30:03.0000] <myakura>
/me remembers he's the member of the wg. cough.

[06:31:00.0000] <annevk>
:)

[06:31:01.0000] <karlcow>
s/he/it/

[06:32:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me needs food. It is obvious.

[06:32:01.0000] <annevk>
I have the feeling that due to the committee process it now tries to be both bold and new and backwards compatible leading to a very poor specification because it accomplishes neither

[06:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
If there's a problem with two different groups assigning different meanings to the namespace http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml, clearly we need to add a layer of indirection so you can bind the short name 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' to one of several alternative expanded references that identify exactly which version of the namespace you want

[06:34:00.0000] <takkaria>
karlcow: well, I wonder where it will be implemented if not in web browsers that people use

[06:35:00.0000] <takkaria>
it amuses be a little bit that in practice XHTML2 will be dependent on HTML5 for text/html parsing

[06:35:01.0000] <karlcow>
takkaria: there are plenty of spaces for *documents* on the (all types) Web

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Perhaps we could define the value of xmlns to be a CURIE, and then use xmlns:http="..." to redefine the meaning of xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"

[06:38:00.0000] <karlcow>
It might be possible that it would not create issues in the end if the communities of usage are clearly separate (wishful thinking) exactly like vocabularies in different communities. cow in argentina and cow in india don't have the same meaning ;)

[06:38:01.0000] <karlcow>
which leads us to my initial comment: I need food for my soul :p now.

[06:38:02.0000] <karlcow>
bbl

[06:41:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, documents using xhtml2 are all very well and good but if they only rely on features that are in previous versions of xhtml then I guess I don't know what the point is

[07:33:00.0000] <annevk>
heh

unfortunately it's not interesting at all

[07:35:01.0000] <annevk>
so I guess that's why he removed it

[07:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://search.twitter.com/search?q=html5+OR+%22html+5%22 is a more useful search

[07:42:00.0000] <annevk>
i use separate tabs for them

[07:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wishes you could follow searches on Twitter :P

[08:27:00.0000] <karlcow>
gsnedders: you can follow searches. There is an rss feed for them or maybe I have not understood the question

[08:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
karlcow: I mean as if they were a user on twitter

[08:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: seems a bit exaggerated to compare HTML5 to the Massacre of the Innocents

[08:43:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah...

[08:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
is there any test case data on how local(...) matches on font names in different environments?

[08:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
should I say local("Linux Libertine Italic") or also local("LinLibertineI")?

[08:47:00.0000] <annevk>
jdaggett would know

[08:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wish I had some way to debug why my GPOS table seems to be entirely ignored on OS X

[08:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It seems there are three plausible ways to identify a font:

[08:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
1) Family, space, Style

[08:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
2) Full name

[08:51:03.0000] <hsivonen>
3) PostScript name

[08:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ah, it's in the spec although I didn't see it when I was scanning it the first time

[08:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
"For TrueType and OpenType fonts, the full font name as defined in the font name table is used to reference a given face. Additionally, for TrueType and OpenType fonts user agents may optionally support Postscript name lookup on platforms where that is appropriate."

[08:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
although it seems that all of Firefox, Safari and Opera on Mac are sensitive to the Family name field when it comes to traditional non-@font-face use...

[09:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It seems I can't do Web authoring without getting myself into a situation that calls for test cases :-/

[09:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/font-local.html

[09:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. totally surprising results

[09:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so far, it seems that using the postscript name works best and using the full name is harmful in Opera

[09:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this is on Mac

[09:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, maybe OS X is automatically translating "i{combining grave accent}" into "{i with grave accent}" without even looking at the font's substitution tables

[09:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is there some kind of Unicode normalisation that does that?

[09:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
NFD

[09:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, wait

[09:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
NFC

[09:25:03.0000] <gsnedders>
NFD does the opposite

[09:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
s/opposite/inverse/

[09:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
eww. MgOpen Cosmetica looks awful on Windows. Hinting gone badly wrong.

[09:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
So... I have a list of characters (by which I mean codepoints) that the user says they want. I need to work out which glyphs are required for those characters. If OS X is seemingly NFCing the input text and therefore the characters it tries to render are not the characters the user asked for, then that's a bit annoying :-(

[09:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess I need a copy of the normalisation tables, and if some string "xy" normalises to "z" and the user asked for "x" and "y" then I'll have to include "z"

[09:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if I have multiple styles of a @font-face font within a family, Opera 10 uses the last @font-face per family for all styles

[09:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
which sucks pretty badly

[09:29:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if that is a sane thing to do

[09:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Wow, the latest mr last week post is really not funny

[09:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/the latest (.*) post/$1/ ?

[09:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:)

[09:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe he's trying to make a statement related to "I liked X better when it was underground."

[10:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray, now i-grave works on OS X too

[10:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
The only thing that doesn't quite work is Arabic in DejaVu Sans on OS X, and I don't care enough to fix it now

[10:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Is there any reason why <ul><ins><li></ins></ul> isn't conforming?

[12:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
IE appears to have a limit of 32 embedded fonts per page

[12:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
oh noes!

[12:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's not very good when you're trying to make a page that demonstrates lots of different fonts :-p

[12:39:00.0000] <jruderman>
i wonder how they chose they limit

[12:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it might actually be a font limit, not an embedded font limit

[12:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
and it might not be precisely 32, but it looked close for me

[12:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/close/close enough/

[12:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Fortunately I can't find 32 free (modifiable, distributable) fonts that have TrueType outlines and work cross-platform and don't like incredibly rubbish, so the limit isn't much of a problem

[13:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
so can anyone think of a DOM API other than XHR, the Location object, and various APIs that map to element attributes (like HTMLAnchorElement.href) that allows the author to give a relative URL that then needs to be resolved?

[13:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
addEventSource()

[13:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
the data grid getRowImage() api

[13:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
window.open()

[13:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
registerProtocolHandler and registerContentHandler

[13:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
pushState()

[13:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
resolveURL()

[13:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
removeEventSource(), duh

[13:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
postMessage()

[13:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
wow, surprisingly many of these are new

[13:34:00.0000] <jruderman>
setting style properties, if that counts

[13:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm really looking for things that depend on the script to get the base uri, and i think in that case the style sheet provides the base uri

[13:38:00.0000] <jruderman>
document.load

[15:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: what's document.load()?

[15:20:00.0000] <jruderman>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.load i guess

[15:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, dom3 l&s should be ignored :-)

[15:44:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: i noticed that html5 defines a few quirks mode behaviors. are you going to try to define most/all of them?

[15:44:01.0000] <jruderman>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla_Quirks_Mode_Behavior

[15:44:02.0000] <jruderman>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=475191 made me wonder

[15:47:00.0000] <jruderman>
oh "Some obsolete legacy attributes parse colors in a more complicated manner."

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
the idea is for the spec to be a complete description of how to implement a user agent (web browser, command line tool, search engine, whatever) in a manner that is compatible with existing content

[15:48:01.0000] <karlcow>
jruderman: there was partial implementation of DOM 3 Load and Save in Firefox, opera betas and Konqueror in… 2005 at least if I remember correctly

[15:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
so that no implementor ever feels the need to do anything not in the spec for compatibility

[15:49:00.0000] <karlcow>
the products implementing it were Xerces, X-Hive, pxdom

[15:50:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: so a quirk shared by all modern browsers is likely to get included

[15:50:01.0000] <karlcow>
http://www.w3.org/2003/10/DOM-Level-3-LS-implementations.html

[15:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
jruderman: I believe zcorpan looked at quirks-mode colour parsing a while ago

[15:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
jruderman: http://simon.html5.org/test/html/rendering/color-attributes/ and http://simon.html5.org/specs/html-color-attributes might be relevant

[15:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: yeah. and hopefully the browsers will all converge on one set of (standardised) quirks

[15:58:00.0000] <jruderman>
Philip`: nice, thanks

Hmm… Coding, or "The Time Traveller's Wife"…

[05:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Every time I think my font stuff is working, I find more brokenness :-(

[05:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Currently a font containing just "i" fails to draw the character's dot in Firefox on Linux

[06:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. font-variant: small-caps; interaction with @font-face is borked in Gecko, WebKit and Presto

[06:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ooh, I made a font that crashes Firefox

[06:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
(on Linux)

[06:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
...though interestingly it crashes when the text is 2em, but not when it's 1em

[06:32:00.0000] <wilhelm_>
Feel free to send me a list of the webfonts issues you find in Presto, and I'll follow up.

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wilhelm_: Presto seems to have a bug analogous to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=475240

[06:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(WebKit, too.)

[06:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the test case isn't great, since it depends on another bug being present (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=458634)

[06:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
test case now fixed

[06:40:01.0000] <wilhelm_>
Thanks.

[08:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xhtml2/2009Jan/0080.html - "we were on a presentational-markup-purge kick for a while a few years ago." - hmm, does that mean they don't really mind presentational markup now?

[08:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps it means that some are starting to realise that a overzealous separation of semantics and presentation doesn't really solve any problems and can make the resulting language impractical in some cases

[08:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's really confusing writing code containing Hebrew/Arabic text, because my text editor likes replacing "{" and "(" with "}" and ")" when they're adjacent to RTL text

[08:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: I see that Firefox isn't clever enough to handle "i<span style=color:red>&#x300;</span>" correctly :-(

[08:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, that depends what you consider to be the correct rendering.

[08:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
at least Firefox combines them correctly, even if it doesn't get the color right. Opera gets the color correct, but doesn't combine them

[08:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Clearly it should be an &igrave; but the accent should be red

[08:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
if that's possible to implement, then sure.

[08:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't care about whether it's possible to implement

[08:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's just an implementation detail

[08:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Actually I'd be pretty surprised if it really was possible to implement

[08:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
it depends if it gets rendered as two separate glyphs overlayed on each other, or whether it gets rendered as the single i with grave character

[08:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
In the font I'm testing with, the font contains instructions that say i followed by combining-grave should cause the i to be replaced with a dotless-i glyph, and then gives instructions on how to position the combining-grave relative to the dotless-i

[08:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
which I suppose wouldn't make it as impossible to implement as it would be if i plus combining-grave was replaced with a single i-grave glyph which is composed of the dotless-i glyph and the grave glyph

[08:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which I think is what some other fonts do)

[09:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, excellent - IE8 appears to render ligatures when my content is on a remote server, but fails to do so when exactly the same content is on my local server

[10:14:00.0000] <roc>
a lot of fonts have precomposed forms for common accented characters

[10:16:00.0000] <roc>
but you're right, we don't style the parts differently even when we could.

[10:17:00.0000] <roc>
still, the most important thing is that the combining marks be combined properly, which we do get right while other browsers (with the possible exception of IE?) do not.

[10:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: IE doesn't seem to combine them properly - it draws an i with a dot and the accent

[10:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
As far as I can tell, WebKit pre-composes the combining marks with the previous character into a single codepoint before passing it to the font renderer

[10:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
(at least in cases like i-grave where there is a pre-composed codepoint it can use)

[10:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and at least on OS X; it seems to just go crazy on Windows)

[10:50:00.0000] <olliej>
Philip`: have you filed bugs? :D

[10:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
olliej: Of course not :P

[10:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
olliej: No, I've just moaned on IRC :-)

[10:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
are the problem, I think

[10:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I suppose I should stop being so lazy, and just file the bug :-)

[11:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, it works in WebKit nightlies

[11:11:00.0000] <olliej>
Philip`: victory!

[11:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
olliej: Don't think you'll get away with it that easily!

/me wonders if CSS defines rendering for i<span style=position:absolute;top:100px>&#x300;</span>

[11:27:01.0000] <annevk>
/me assumes it does not

[11:29:00.0000] <Philip`>

"The WHATWG for example are pursuing a much more monolithic approach with HTML5; they see no need for extension points, since the language itself will cover everything."

[12:21:00.0000] <annevk>
He doesn't even explain what the concerns are with the RDF approach, just some musings on that the microformats and WHATWG community are against it

[12:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
adding a footer element to a language takes time, and requires jumping through all sorts of hoops (...) But adding a footer role value takes no time at all, and you don't need to ask anyone.

[12:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How to reconcile this with "we need namespaces for everything to avoid collisions"

[12:35:00.0000] <takkaria>
hm, Drupal is incorporating RDFa

[12:35:01.0000] <takkaria>
with faux-namespaces

[13:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Two lastweek entries in a row without references to bodily functions, oh ho

[14:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7850173.stm - "... The disk, which was mislaid in December by courier firm TNT, contained names, salaries, national insurance numbers and bank account numbers. But the British Council said the data could not be accessed as the disk was securely encrypted."

[14:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems pretty silly to complain about people losing data when the data was encrypted

[14:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
because the whole point of encryption is that it doesn't matter if other people end up with a copy of your data

[14:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
and if you complain anyway, you remove the PR incentive for people to use encryption

[14:22:00.0000] <danbri>
there's some pretty lame encryption around though

[14:24:00.0000] <danbri>
& there are tools like http://www.softsea.com/review/Zip-Key.html if the encryption uses a lame password

[14:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose that's a good point

[14:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
but it seems the more reliable solution is to make sure you have decent encryption and decent passwords, rather than attempting to stop humans losing discs

[14:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
but then the encryption process has to be set up and maintained by humans, who will probably do it wrong

[14:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
We should just get rid of humans

[14:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
and as a bonus there wouldn't be any people whose data you could store and then lose

[14:34:00.0000] <annevk>
there's a fallacy in there somewhere

[14:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so many @font-face bugs in so many browsers :-(

[14:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has given up trying to make his test page work on OS X without crashing

[14:39:01.0000] <Dashiva>

[14:39:02.0000] <Dashiva>
(to you)

[14:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, and now Firefox is rendering the word "Deja" with no dot on the j :-/

[14:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
(s/Firefox/Pango/ probably)

[14:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like there's a lot of cases where the OpenType spec doesn't prohibit weird things, but implementations break if you do those weird things

[14:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. if you have empty glyph-classes

[14:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
we need OpenType5, clearly

[14:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or we need to only have experts producing OpenType files

[14:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
which seems to have worked alright for the past decade

[14:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And not assholes like Philip`

[14:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Indeed

[15:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray, 'j' works

[15:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is getting fairly quick at guessing what Pango objects to, and hacking his code so it outputs something just slightly less weird

[15:19:00.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, yt?

[15:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I started writing up a draft for the about: URI scheme http://lachy.id.au/dev/specs/about-uri/draft-lachy-about-uri-00.txt

[17:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
oops, I'll fix it

[18:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: you should send a mail to the list about it then, because i know of at least two other people who have written or said they would write something

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i replied to the monolithic thing on ww-html

[18:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's with about: suddenly being something people want to write specs about

[18:43:00.0000] <karlcow>
and I know another person who has started a draft

[18:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess all four of these people should get together :-)

[18:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
who else has drafted it?

[18:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk talked about doing it, iirc, and i have one person who e-mailed me with a draft (i told them to post it to one of the lists, haven't checked if they have yet)

[18:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, I don't mind if someone takes over from me. I'll send mine to the list anyway and see what happens

[19:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
does public-html accept posts from non-subscribers? I just sent to it from the wrong email address, and want to know if I should resend from the correct address

[19:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, no, the list serv wants my permission to publish it. I can just decline

[19:43:00.0000] <karlcow>
and someone sent me a direct message on twitter

[19:44:00.0000] <karlcow>
I'll reply to the person with the mail on the list

[00:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: as i understand it, the <!DOCTYPE> in XHTML5 is a purely XML-level concern

[00:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
it can point to a DTD, have an internal subset, whatever

[00:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's equivalent to the use or lack of use of <![CDATA[]]> or &#x....;, just part and parcel of XML

[00:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: "You can now disable an entire fieldset by using the disabled attribute on it. This was not possible before." - this bullet point is phrased differently from the others

wilhelm_: sorry about the bug report yesterday. It's invalid, because font-variant is not permitted in @font-face.

[01:17:00.0000] <roc>
phew!

[01:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's a bit confusing to have things that look like CSS properties specced for two purposes in the same spec and then scroll to the wrong point when reading the spec piece-wise

[01:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: "3.1.  about:blank   Applications resolving this URI must return an empty resource, containing nothing." - an empty *text/html* resource (if the UA supports text/html)

[01:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: although i'm not sure if it should say anything about the quirkyness...

[01:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does about:blank have a well-defined charset?

[01:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(for the various DOM charset-related properties)

[01:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, I wasn't sure if about:blank needed to have an explicit MIME type, since it's interpretation would depend upon the nature of the application in which it's used. Although currently that may only include web brows.ers

[01:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: dunno

[01:32:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: web pages typically enable designMode on about:blank iframes

[01:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: so in browsers for iframes it has to be text/html

[01:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but I mean, shouldn't it be HTML5 that defines it to be interpreted as text/html?

[01:34:01.0000] <zcorpan>
likely :)

[01:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
why have the emptyness requirement for about:blank?

[01:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll add something explaining how to deal with the MIME type

[01:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, which DOM charset properties would be affected by the charset of about:blank, rather than the charset attributes on various elements?

[02:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It seems kind of nasty for HTML5 to determine the type of a resource not just from its HTTP Content-Type header, nor from the context from which it was requested, nor from sniffing its content bytes, but from comparing its URL against a hardcoded string

[02:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: html5 is nasty

[02:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: It can't shun necessary nastiness, but that doesn't mean we should encourage gratuitous nastiness

[02:41:00.0000] <annevk>
seems better to just define about:blank as an empty text/html resource in no quirks mode

[02:42:00.0000] <annevk>
thanks zcorpan, I was hoping you'd review it :)

[02:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: welcome :)

[02:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, why does it need to be no quirks mode?

[02:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
Safari and Firefox use quirks mode. Opera uses no quirks mode.

[02:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
IE8 doesn't seem to want to let me execute javascrpit URIs in the address bar

[02:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
so javascript:alert(document.compatMode); doesn't tell me which mode it uses

[02:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
but using <iframe src=about:blank> and a script, IE8 uses quirks mode too

[02:57:00.0000] <annevk>
just seems nicer, especially since about:blank is always used with designMode

[02:57:01.0000] <annevk>
does it by any chance depend on other factors as well then? seems likely that Opera would break stuff if it's that different

[02:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
does HTML5 currently say anything about using standards mode for about:blank? I couldn't find anything like that

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.openmedianow.org/

[04:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, yt?

[04:20:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, sorry about the pony, but the rest is done

[04:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I have a functioning polyglot UTF-8/UTF-16LE JavaScript file, as you requested http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090123#l-239

[04:29:00.0000] <annevk>
that sounds cool, where?

[04:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's not published yet. I'm just working out how to demo it effectively

[04:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
hmm. Do scripts served without a charset inherit the encoding of the document?

[04:32:00.0000] <annevk>
<script charset=utf-8 src=...></script> <script charset=utf-16 src=...></script>

[04:32:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, that's the idea

[04:32:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll do that

[04:32:03.0000] <annevk>
but using the charset attribute is easier

[04:32:04.0000] <Lachy>
is the charset attribute supported?

[04:32:05.0000] <annevk>
it should be, yes

[04:32:06.0000] <annevk>
though this might have been in part to try to find out to what extent it is

[04:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: cool, will check

[04:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, ok. In that case, I could serve the document as ISO-8859-1 and ensure that the script will only execute if the script is parsed as UTF-8 or UTF-16LE

[04:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
currently, it uses an ASCII function name for UTF-8 which will work in 8859-1. I'll make it non-ASCII

[04:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I weant the charset, characterSet and defaultCharset properties of the HTMLDocument interface

[04:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, dear. serving the doc as 8859-1 won't work cause the UTF-16LE interpretion of the script uses a function name that can't be represented in 8859-1.

[04:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Moving to an apartment building built in 2001 is an interesting experience after living in a building built in 1946. The new one has *manuals*.

[04:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me has never had manuals for an apartment before

[04:47:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, load another script that calls the function?

[04:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, yeah, that's what I thought too

[04:48:01.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, I suppose you can't use entities inside <script>? does JavaScript allow escapes everywhere like CSS?

[04:48:02.0000] <annevk>
/me thinks the answer to both is "no"

[04:48:03.0000] <Lachy>
I don't remember the rules about JS excapes

[04:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
last thing I need to do is make apache override my normal charset settings so it doesn't send charset=UTF-8 for the JS

[04:58:00.0000] <annevk>
AddDefaultCharset None

[04:58:01.0000] <annevk>
iirc

[05:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that and RemoveCharset

[05:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
except it's Off instead of None

[05:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, about:blank and .characterSet returns UTF-8 and WebKit and Firefox, utf-16 and Opera and undefined in IE. .defaultCharset returns undefined in Firefox and Opera, ISO-8859-1 in Safari and windows-1252 in IE

[05:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/UTF-8 and/UTF-8 in/

[05:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
seems like the closest thing to consensus is to say you parse a zero-length stream whose media type is text/html; charset=utf-8

[05:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that was my assessment too

[05:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, http://lachy.id.au/dev/2009/polyglot/

[05:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: but that gives quirks mode which sucks :)

[05:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
oops, that's buggy still

[05:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
iirc, i've found one opera bug that would be solved by changing about:blank to quirks mode, but it could also be solved by changing from <p> to <div> as default block in contenteditable

[05:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me has a script which can distinguish utf-8 and utf-16 and iso-8859-1

[05:08:02.0000] <zcorpan>
(the bug was that on enter you got a "line break" before the first line)

[05:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/demos/charset/polyglot-script.html

[05:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't understand why no browser works with my version. They're all interpreting the polyglot script file as UTF-8

[05:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Firefox 2 says "UTF-16LE" on http://lachy.id.au/dev/2009/polyglot/polyglot-utf-16le.html

[05:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
FF3 too

[05:18:02.0000] <zcorpan>
seems webkit ignores charset

[05:18:03.0000] <Lachy>
says UTF-8 for me

[05:19:00.0000] <map>
Is there an easy way to hook in a URI resolver/normalizer into html5lib?

[05:20:00.0000] <map>
For URI attribute values like href and src etc.

[05:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That's a bit odd

[05:20:02.0000] <Lachy>
woah, if I use a clean profile in Firefox, it works. But it doesn't work with my normal profile

[05:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll try clearing the cache to see if that fixes it

[05:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Strange config settings?

[05:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
map: As far as I'm aware, html5lib doesn't know anything about which attributes are URIs, so you'd most likely have to parse the document then write code to walk the document tree and update all the relevant attributes

[05:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
map: (which gets a bit complex if you want to resolve URIs correctly when there's a <base href>)

[05:24:00.0000] <map>
Thanks. I was thinking of something like parse.py --resolve-uris --normalize-uris "--document-location="

[05:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
map: That sounds like it could be a useful feature to add as some kind of filter in html5lib, but I don't think anyone's tried implementing it yet

[05:31:00.0000] <map>
Yeh, I personally want to use it to test normalization ideas (like when to leave %HH alone or when to normalize wide characters to UTF-8 %HH etc.). 

[05:31:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: [DOCTYPE] should say "Activating Browser Modes with Doctype"

[05:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
map: Why do you want to do it as part of html5lib, rather than as a feature in whatever application is using the parsed document?

[05:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: i wonder if there's something that has been added that should be included in the Impact on Web Architecture list

[05:36:00.0000] <map>
Phillip: I basically want to experiment with normalizing and resolving similar to how browsers do.  I can do that without a parser and just use test strings, but I wanted to compare with browsers and how they do it. Using html5lib could help with that.

[05:38:00.0000] <map>
Philip`: Part of the reason for this is I want to come up with a solution to solve *particular* normalizing/resolving bugs/differences between  browsers.

[05:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, clearing my cache fixed it

[05:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
It works in Safari, but only if you clear the cache before looking at the other one

[05:39:01.0000] <map>
Philip`: Hooking into htmlserializer.py seems like it might be the easiest way.

[05:40:00.0000] <map>
But I don't know the code at all.

[05:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Ah, right

[05:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: In IE6 in Wine I get "Invalid character" on the utf-16 page, and "Object expected" on the utf-8 page

[05:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
map: Hmm, I'm only familiar with the parser code so I don't know what would be a good way to work with other parts of html5lib

[05:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: (I get "Invalid character" on the utf-16 bit of http://philip.html5.org/demos/charset/polyglot-script.html too, but the other two say "utf-8" and "iso-8859-1" respectively)

[05:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, ok. I'll look at it later. i've got other stuff I need to do ow

[05:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
*now

[05:51:00.0000] <map>
Philip`: Thanks.  I'll investigate. And, I'll try to come up with some examples of what I'm trying to do to make things clearer.

[05:52:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, URLs

[05:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: ok

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Amazon emails me to say "Amazon.co.uk's January Sale Must End Sunday 1st February", presumably just in time for the start of their February sale

[06:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I like <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:blank">

[06:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm also amused by the implications of being strict about the content type when derefercing it.

[06:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, about:blank could work

[06:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
it's even more memorable than sgml-compat and already widely used

[06:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
I want <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:mozilla">

[06:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
or about:robots :-)

[06:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
about:marca no longer works

[06:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
what was about:marca?

[06:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: IIRC, it redirected to Marc Andreessen's home page on people.netscape.com

[06:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[06:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
in NN4?

[06:09:02.0000] <annevk>
about:jwz

[06:09:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: and earlier

[06:09:04.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/blowme.html

[06:09:05.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, which browser does that one work in?

[06:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me appreciates how Opera understands if you type "/." into the address bar

[06:49:00.0000] <karlcow>
hmmm Opera (at least 10.00 alpha) rewrites about: into opera:

[06:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, yes, Opera has always done that

[06:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know why though

[07:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: "If the selectors parameter is set to either null, or undefined in the ECMAScript language binding, the implementation must behave as if an empty string had been passed instead. " - doesn't the idl already require that?

[07:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, sure, but restating it in prose to make it clearer doesn't hurt

[07:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me remembers studying technical drawings at university where it was forbidden to have over-defined dimensions

[07:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: for some reason i see it as an error to have the same thing required twice in a spec

[07:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
your requirement might be subtly different from that in web idl

[07:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
When writing canvas tests, I didn't like it if a requirement existed in more than one place, since I liked having a one-to-one mapping between spec phrases and testable criteria

[07:35:01.0000] <annevk>
as co-editor, I agree with zcorpan :)

[07:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
because that avoids the chance of conflicting requirements and confusion

[07:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
But it's nice to have a non-normative note pointing out relevant behaviour that is normatively defined elsewhere

[07:36:02.0000] <annevk>
ah, [NoInterfaceObject] is aleady there, nice

[07:37:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, it should probably use ImplementedOn (or whatever it was called) instead of prose as well

[07:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2009Jan/0106.html

[07:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, please send mail

[07:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm working through my backlog of feedback and I will get to it by the end of today

[07:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I hate when I find out that I never received an important mail, presumably cause it got caught by one of my spam filters :-(

[07:55:00.0000] <krijnh>
Lachy: a job offer at Google? :)

[07:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
krijnh, no selectors api feedback http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2008OctDec/0245.html

[07:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
You should whitelist relevant mailing lists

[07:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
the only reason I found out about it was because I have a reply to a message I don't have

[07:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
most of the time, it hasn't caused any problems at all. I'm not even sure which filter of mine caught it

[07:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
but I will see if I can add whitelists to my server side filter

[07:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
though I just wish people would stop sending email that looks like spam

[08:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh crap. A whole bunch of emails just disappeard from my IMAP server. WTF?!

[08:31:00.0000] <jcranmer>
it hates you

[08:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, actually, something did screw up, but I didn't lose as many as I thought. There's only 3 missing that I know of

[08:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, it's ok. Crisis is over :-). It was just my email client's cache that got messed up. Clearing it helped :-)

[08:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.agrifirm.com/ - hooray, neurotic namespaces in text/html

[08:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Look for xmlns:wedoit)

[08:39:03.0000] <hsivonen>
is there another well-known name for jis_x0212-1990?

[08:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/data/xmlns-bindings.txt

[08:43:01.0000] <Philip`>

[08:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/data/unbound-prefix-attributes.txt

[08:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not at all sure what any of that is useful for

[08:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
but I wanted to try it anyway

[08:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose one observable point is that while hundreds of pages contain the string xmlns:rdf, only 18 have it in a place where an HTML parser sees it

[08:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and presumably all the rest are in comments)

[08:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: what proportion looks Trackback-motivated?

[08:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No idea

[08:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me notices 14 xmlns:v="urn:scheman-microsoft-com:vml" (sic), 1 xmlns:v="urn:schemas-microDsoft-com:vml"

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Those 14 look like unrelated sites

[08:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
so I guess they copied-and-pasted from one of the four pages listed on http://www.google.com/search?q=%22scheman-microsoft-com%22

[08:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, if you send a response to this mail regarding removing that conformance statement, I'll look into tonight http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2008OctDec/0374.html

[08:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[08:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
Those 14 are not unrelated

[08:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
They're all Ford dealerships, who presumably got sites built from the same template

[08:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, actually they're all Ford dealerships whose domains redirect to subsites of dealerconnection.com

[09:01:00.0000] <annevk>
"10.2. html5lib" cool

[09:01:01.0000] <annevk>
from http://diveintopython3.org/

[09:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone's got to port html5lib to Python 3 first :-)

[09:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, cool. maybe I should learn python 3 as he publishes it

[09:03:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, the backwards compat issues with python are annoying

[09:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
He'll have to write chapter 19 before starting on 10.2

[09:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
backwards incompatibility is a feature, damnot!

[09:08:01.0000] <annevk>
"This site is optimized for Lynx just because fuck you." except it starts by talking about PapayaWhip :p

[09:08:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Bus routes are crazy

[09:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: They're just reflecting the craziness of humans, who always want to be somewhere other than where they are

[09:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Yes, but on a bus service going pretty much due west it seems stupid to spend the entire time going north and south

[09:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(And there are bigger better roads heading due west too)

[09:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, does it have many stops along the way?

[09:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Yeah

[09:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: That's the excuse, obviously

[09:18:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: No, he doesn't have to write chapter 19 first, he just needs to know how to do it himself

[09:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Only if he's going to port html5lib himself

[09:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Who else will?

[09:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Magical elves will

[11:05:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#audience : "defined in this specificaton" (sic for specification)

[11:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has almost no idea about what he wants to do at uni

[11:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't even decide whether to do an arts degree or a science degree :P

[11:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Arts degrees are a waste of time, therefore you should do a science degree

[11:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's an easy decision when you look at it the right way

[11:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: A science degree in what, then?

[11:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: A degree in, uh, scientificness

[11:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
They're all the same really

[11:33:02.0000] <svl>
gsnedders: doesn't really matter. Something which'll keep your interest for the duration. The important thing it'll teach you is a way of thinking and approaching problems.

[11:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
svl: The problem is I have no idea what'll keep my interest :)

[11:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
svl: I applied to do physics starting this year, but my interest (despite having been strong for many years) has now mainly gone

[11:35:00.0000] <svl>
gsnedders: what're the options? (You have a preferred university, right?) Something broad or something applied probably has the highest chance of containing a path through that'll see you complete it.

[11:36:00.0000] <webben>
gsnedders: Do you know how come you lost interest?

[11:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
svl: Well, I'm not really sure I want to go to any of the places I have offers from, thus the entire question about applying again (and what for)

[11:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
svl: Also, esp. in England/Wales (far more so than Scotland) degrees really aren't very broad

[11:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
webben: Too much electronics and atomic-level physics this year

[11:38:00.0000] <webben>
gsnedders: Hmm. So what parts of physics do you prefer?

[11:38:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/electronics/electromagnetism/

[11:38:02.0000] <gsnedders>
webben: Stuff on a bit bigger scale:)

[11:38:03.0000] <webben>
:)

[11:38:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Y'know, stuff we can see?

[11:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
If I drop a ball, I care about gravity. I don't care about a charge from the air transferring to the ball.

[11:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(Though a magnetic field may influence it, to be fair to electromagnetism)

[11:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The only place I'm particularly tempted to go from which I've received an offer for is Edi. for computational physics

[11:41:00.0000] <webben>
/me wonders if that's a failing of the course for not connecting electromagnetism/atomic-level physics to real-world applications.

[11:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But that is a stupidly easy course to get into and I could easily get an offer for it again, if I re-applied for elsewhere too

[11:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(i.e., normally the number of offers made is identical to the number of applicants)

[11:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(and I well exceed the entrance requirements)

[11:42:02.0000] <svl>
gsnedders: _any_ studies will start with a lot of background material and a broad overview that'll include a lot of things you'll not be interested in and won't ever need.

[11:43:00.0000] <svl>
You'll just have to accept that you'll need to go through that to get to the final year or two in which you're doing solely and purely the things you absolutely love.

[11:44:00.0000] <svl>
So with determining what to go for, focus on the things you do like, not on what you don't like.

[11:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is also an indecisive bastard :)

[11:45:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me wonders which countries Philip` and svl are from. Specifically when I read things like "[14:35]  <Philip`> Arts degrees are a waste of time, therefore you should do a science degree"

[11:46:00.0000] <svl>
/me is from the Netherlands. Based on Philip`'s comment, I suspect he's from the USA. :)

[11:46:01.0000] <karlcow>
which somehow shows that the way of thinking was not that successful "The important thing it'll teach you is a way of thinking and approaching problems."

[11:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
svl: Philip` is UK

[11:47:01.0000] <svl>
shows what I know. :)

[11:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me does have the advantage of having me him :)

[11:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You have you me?

[12:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks to lachy and philip, http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/script/encodings/001-demo.html now supports utf-16 too

[12:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
and the rdfa community continues to discuss syntax issues without at all explaining to me what rdfa is for (and thus how to evaluate its usefulness in html5)

[12:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know how much clearer i can make my request

[14:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
hm, IE8 now in feature freeze

[14:32:01.0000] <takkaria>
I wonder if they've prefixed vendor-specific extensions yet

[14:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love when i'm trying to work out what i should spec in some edge case and the browser i use to find out what The Platform does today... crashes

[15:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: So, I take it you decide to not copy that behaviour, then?

[15:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, yt?

[15:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[15:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
it looks like all you did to write the audience section was to move the vague, overly broad statement from the scope section to a new audience section. That doeesn't make it any less vague or overly broad

[15:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's no broader than html5's, the problem now is just that the spec itself is far too narrow to match the given audience statement

[15:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, is there a public CVS repo for your spec

[15:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: No. That's an issue with hosting anything on www.w3.org. Which is why I think dev.w3.org is better

[15:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I need to just move it over to dev.w3.org

[15:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I need to push for getting some more horsepower behind dev.w3.org to address that problems that systeam has pointed out

[15:52:01.0000] <heycam>
/me wonders what specs dev.w3.org has

[15:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
heycam, lots from WebApps, HTML, and CSS WGs

[15:53:01.0000] <heycam>
as in speed/memory, not which web specifications :)

[15:53:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[15:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
you gotta admit, that was an ambiguous query :-P

[15:54:00.0000] <heycam>
yeah =)

[15:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't know what kind of machine it is, but I think it's extremely low-spec

[15:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think it started out as just being a place to publicly manage the source for a couple of tools

[15:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
But it then evolved to a lot more from there

[15:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
As these kinds of things tend to do.

[15:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, can't they just move it to the same set of servers that they run w3.org from?

[15:58:01.0000] <annevk>
nn

[15:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn


2009-01-27
[16:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: Yeah, I would think the Web interface to the dev stuff could be hosted on the same machines as www.w3.org, just using virtual hosting

[16:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would suspect that's already been considered and rejected for some reason, but maybe not

[16:11:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll ask.

[16:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
I know exactly nothing about any of this, but I don't see why a simple caching proxy wouldn't solve most of the load problems from people requesting the latest version of the spec

[16:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
yay, someone contacted me about taking over the about: URI spec.

[16:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
wtf i broke the websocket spec script

[16:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
without touching any relevant parts

[16:40:00.0000] <roc>
Mmmm, RDF-Video. The video can just encode the semantics of what's happening, and the browser can construct a rendering from that. That would get really great compression too.

[16:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: it'd be interesting to ask pixar what the ratio is from assets to final rendered bitmap, and how many minutes it takes before you do in fact get compression

[17:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
speaking of video, Sun seems to be pretty serious about their OMS Video project

[17:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least it appears that they are investing serious money to do patent review (or whatever it's called) for everything in the spec

[17:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and their goal seems to be to make it at least as good as H.264

[17:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the money at stake around licensing costs is really significant

[17:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, that's the same goal of Theora and Dirac, isn't it?

[17:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: I suppose so

[17:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
I guess it's good to see more free alternatives, along with Ogg, Matroska, Theora, Dirac and Vorbis. Though having too many competing technologies can be someone counter productive

[17:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
*somewhat

[17:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think the cases where having competing technologies is productive far outnumber the cases where it's not.

[17:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least over the long term

[17:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
eek, they're also doing Project DReaM :-( http://www.openmediacommons.org/

[17:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
one big goal of any serious codec effort should be to get widspread support for at the hardware level on devices, particularly mobile devices and other constrained devices

[17:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think in the video market, there have been far too many competing technologies, which probably had a lot to do with patents and each vendor wanting to control the market

[17:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's why we still today have few interoperable codecs and container formats supported between the major media players

[17:16:01.0000] <rubys>
is the root problem vendors wanting control or competition?

[17:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
the root is probably vendors wanting control, since that creates a lot of competiton from other vendors wanting control

[17:18:01.0000] <rubys>
+1

[17:18:02.0000] <rubys>
ironically, the solution to such problems is often *more* competition instead of less.

[17:18:03.0000] <Lachy>
although, choice can be good. Different codecs are optimised for different situations

[17:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
just like we have PNG, GIF and JPG for different types of images, the video container formats and codecs are good for different uses

[17:20:00.0000] <rubys>
PNG probably wouldn't exist if it weren't for (now expired) patent concerns

[17:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
like Ogg, I think, is good for streaming, whereas Matroska is good as a general purpose container format

[17:20:02.0000] <Lachy>
PNG is superior to GIF in many ways, including lossless compression and transparency, so it probably would

[17:21:00.0000] <rubys>
I'm not so sure.  Supperior design is an outcome of what competition produces, but if GIF were "good enough", there might not have been such an effort.

[17:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
in fact, the usefulness of GIF has shrunk significantly, especially in light if APNG being slowly adopted

[17:23:00.0000] <rubys>
And yet, GIF will likely be around for as long as RSS 2.0 is.  <ducks> :-)

[17:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
sure, healthy competition is good. The problem is the unhealthy competition stifled by patents

[17:23:02.0000] <Lachy>
RSS 2.0? Is that crap still around?

[17:23:03.0000] <rubys>
In abundant quantities.

[17:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's use should die out over the next decade or so as CMSs get upgraded

[17:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
does WordPress support Atom out of the box yet?

[17:25:00.0000] <rubys>
yes, but it is hidden and isn't the default

[17:26:00.0000] <rubys>
your feed is apparently atom produced by wordpress...

[17:26:01.0000] <rubys>
http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Flachy.id.au%2Flog%2Ffeed

[17:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, cause I installed the Atom plugin a long time ago

[17:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
In fact, I only used RSS for a very brief period during my blog's lifetime. It was atom 0.3 originally before finally moving to 1.0

[18:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, Giovanni's reasons for wanting the spec modularised are the exact opposite of why I don't. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/2009Jan/0066.html

[18:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
"Yes, but it is easier to read only the page containing the feature I want, then to search an heavy and difficult document, with the features I need spreaded all across and concept I may not have any idea what they mean."

[18:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
whereas I find the monolithic document signifcantly easier and less time consuming than trying to work out which spec, or even which page of the multipage version, I need to look at first

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah me too

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
i hate multipage specs

[18:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
but we have a multipage html5 spec, anyway

[18:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
and soon apparently we'll have two!

[18:16:04.0000] <jcranmer>
I prefer multipage

[18:16:05.0000] <jcranmer>
actually, I prefer PDF

[18:16:06.0000] <Hixie>
we have that too :-)

[18:16:07.0000] <Lachy>
the only thing I don't like about the single page spec is the TOC script you have running on it is slow

[18:16:08.0000] <jcranmer>
but multipage means it's not loading a gazillion-thick page

[18:16:09.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: really?

[18:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: that's odd

[18:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it should be blazing fast

[18:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, it takes a few seconds to load in which my browser is frozen

[18:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: you sure you don't mean the issue marker script?

[18:17:04.0000] <Lachy>
I only started noticing the delay afrter you added the TOC script

[18:17:05.0000] <Hixie>
there's four scripts in the html5 spec right now

[18:17:06.0000] <Hixie>
dfn, issues, toc, and updates

[18:17:07.0000] <Lachy>
but it could be the issue marker script

[18:17:08.0000] <Hixie>
the only slow one should be the issues one

[18:17:09.0000] <Hixie>
(er, status, not issues)

[18:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
reload now and see if it is faster

[18:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
PDF specs are even worse than multipage spaces

[18:18:02.0000] <Lachy>
*specs

[18:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
they're only useful if you have the insane desire to waste a ream of paper

[18:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
still slow?

[18:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
woah. the PDF is up to 718 pages now :-)

[18:23:00.0000] <takkaria>
I hope the HTML 5 spec gets published in paper form at some point

[18:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
does the TOC script run last?

[18:23:02.0000] <takkaria>
I want to up my carbon footprint a bit since I don't own a car

[18:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yes

[18:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. make it run first. Let the status script go last if it takes the longest

[18:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
that way I can see if the TOC script is really causing the problem, or if the TOC has loaded and I still get problems

[18:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm changing the way i run the scripts

[18:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm also getting a script error: initAnnotations is not defined

[18:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i commented out the status script

[18:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
so if you were still seeing it slow, then it's not that

[18:25:04.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[18:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
how is it now?

[18:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
better

[18:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
pity

[18:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
the scripts aren't running at all right now :-)

[18:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
I noticed

[18:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
how about now

[18:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's fine

[18:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[18:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
the TOC script is missing still. Was that the culprit?

[18:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
it is?

[18:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
wfm

[18:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
doesn't wfm

[18:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
error console?

[18:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
works after I cleared my cache.

[18:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[18:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's the second time my cache has caused problems for me today. I wonder what's going on with it

[18:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
maybe my profile has degraded and I need to create a fresh one

[18:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
there's still a small delay though, but it's not too bad

[18:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok food time. bbiab.

[20:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, the browsing-context-or-keyword definition doesn't allow "()" as a valid value. The parentheses appear to be used only for grouping, and I think it indicates that target="" is a valid value

[20:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I could be wrong. I find the syntax to be confusing too

[20:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's what i mean

[20:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
"" is not valid

[20:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, from your email, it looked like you through target="()" was a valid value

[20:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
but this just proves that the syntax is confusing :-)

[20:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well

[20:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
no disagreement there

[20:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's fine for people who need such formalisms for developing tools like validators, but definitely not for average authors

[20:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
woah, I didn't realise that Mike had copied the first paragraph of the Audience section in HTML5 verbatim into his draft till just now

[20:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
I thought it was something he had written in the scope section before. That's why I wanted to see the CVS revisions so I could check what the previous draft said

[22:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
what do you call the function that's the first function in a call stack? that is, the one that started everything?

[22:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
in particular in JS

[22:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
would be "the program" in a process stack trace

[22:30:03.0000] <takkaria>
God

[22:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
s/stack trace/call stack/

[22:36:00.0000] <heycam>
"top execution context" is a phrase in ECMA-232

[22:37:00.0000] <heycam>
syntactically, the name of the production is "Program"

[22:38:00.0000] <heycam>
oops sorry, "top execution context" refers to one most recently put on the stack

[22:43:00.0000] <heycam>
hmm djokovic retired

[23:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
heycam: might not be the Program (e.g. from could be a callback)

[23:15:00.0000] <heycam>
Hixie, top call?

[23:15:01.0000] <heycam>
i think that's what some JS engines might call it

[23:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just called it the "first script"

[23:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
can always rename it later

hmm, doesn't html5 expose event handler attributes on HTMLDocument?

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie's claim is that e.g. document.onload only works in Opera

[02:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but that's because the load event doesn't bubble through document

[02:03:01.0000] <zcorpan>
not because document.onload doesn't exist

[02:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
document.onclick seems to work everywhere?

[02:04:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3Cscript%3Edocument.onclick%20%3D%20function(e)%20%7B%20w(e)%20%7D%3C%2Fscript%3E

/me files a bug

[02:33:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, do you have IE8?

[02:33:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, any chance you can test if both overflow-x and overflow-y still work or if they only work with a prefix?

[02:33:02.0000] <annevk>
(if someone else here can do it, great!)

[02:36:00.0000] <virtuelv>
annevk: when were you going to Oslo again?

[02:38:00.0000] <annevk>
mañana

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk>
but late, so I'll see you Thursday

[02:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: they work (in RC1)

[02:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
-ms-overflow-x only works in IE8 mode

[02:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
unprefixed version works in quirks, IE7 and IE8 mode

[02:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm maybe i should test their almost standards mode some time

[02:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
window.onerror is null in ie8

[02:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
what's the reason for having onerror be undefined again?

/me e-mails the CSS WG

[02:52:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I don't think there was one in particular

[03:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
do Safari, Chrome and Opera have something like chardet?

[03:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if they do have it, do they deliberately not have UI for it?

[03:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if Firefox could get away with having chardet always on without UI for turning it off

[03:02:00.0000] <annevk>
we have heuristics for determining the encoding, if that is what you mean

[03:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>

Does anyone have any idea where ubuntu hides the python pstats module these days?

[03:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: so the heuristics are always part of the HTTP, BOM, meta, heuristics chain?

[03:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
without UI for changing the chain to HTTP, BOM, meta, windows-1252?

[03:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me discovers it is in python-profiler in multiverse despite being part of the stdlib

[03:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: non-free?

[03:06:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure I understand encoding UI

[03:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
It would be interesting to know if encoding UI is still strictly necessary

[03:06:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Does anyone?

[03:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me guesses many browsers could reduce their encoding UI by 95%

[03:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Safari is pretty reduced, but they opted to have UI for encodings

[03:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: It seems like pstats has an odd license which probably makes it non-free indeed (but I did not think that Ubuntu were religious about such things)

[03:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I think the level of religiosity depends on how generally visible and useful a package is

"This site is optimized for Lynx just because fuck you."

krijnh, the funny thing is that at the top it talks about a color not supported by Lynx at all :p

[03:42:01.0000] <annevk>
well, actually, the next sentence makes that funny as it implies Mark never looked at anything but Lynx

[03:42:02.0000] <krijnh>
Yeah, I just search up for 'fuck' and noticed your comment :)

[03:43:00.0000] <krijnh>

wow, about:blank has been submitted to IETF now. http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/staging/draft-holsten-about-uri-scheme-00.txt - I wasn't expecting that to be done so quickly, especially cause Joseph listed me as an editor

[03:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
looks like he took what I wrote and combined it with what he had and submitted it without even letting me review the changes

[03:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Does "submitted to the IETF" mean anything more than "uploaded to their web servers as a temporary storage location for early drafts"?

[03:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know

[03:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
I  have no experience with the IETF submission process

[03:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Don't submitters need to promise something about rights?

[03:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know

[04:01:00.0000] <xydyx>
hsivonen: what should I do about "Bad MD5 hash for http://archive.apache.org/dist/xerces/j/Xerces-J-bin.2.9.1.zip."

[04:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
xydyx: first you should check if the server gave you a 404 page or somethinga along those lines instead of a zip file

[04:03:00.0000] <xydyx>
it's a zip,  6952959 bytes

[04:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
xydyx: hmm. that's interesting

[04:04:01.0000] <xydyx>
ETag: "cb4e73-6a17ff-43a2388b9ffc0"

[04:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[04:07:01.0000] <xydyx>
wget got the whole file, I'll try replacing build.py with localhost

[04:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
You should be able to just copy the downloaded file into build/dependencies, I think

[04:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
and then build.py won't try downloading it again

[04:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, build/../dependencies

[05:22:00.0000] <annevk>
the problem is, I'm 22

[05:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I was hoping no one would stir that issue until the group working on ATAG came up with a suggestion on what they want tools to do

[05:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
Curiously the first verse of the song I was quoting ends "Is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours talking endlessly to anyone who's there", which seems curiously apropos

[05:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: In Gez's list the consumer side of that question is addressed ("with no alt UAs have to guess which results in gibberish") but not the producer side ("in the absence of a human who cares and understands the issue well enough the producer has to guess which often results in authoratitive gibberish")

[05:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Gez's comment form doesn't do Unicode

[05:28:00.0000] <xydyx>
./ant warns "You must set JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the directory where your JDK is installed."; but the build goes on with heaps of errors then fails 

[05:28:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: have you let him know?

[05:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: only by leaving comments with broken characters

[05:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
xydyx: you need to set JAVA_HOME

[05:30:00.0000] <xydyx>
I know, but I have to scroll up a lot to see the message

[05:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
xydyx: yeah, the build script sucks in many ways

[05:30:02.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, it seems better to not make about: depend on HTML5 as I do not think it is needed

[05:30:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders to what extent the mathematical syntax used in theoretical computer science is determined by the availability of nice-looking symbols in LaTeX

[05:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, if it's going to define about:blank returns a text/html document, shouldn't it reference something?

[05:33:01.0000] <annevk>
there's a text/html RFC

[05:33:02.0000] <annevk>
which HTML5 will update in due course

[05:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Reply to my mail about that on the list to let Joseph know

[05:34:01.0000] <annevk>
sure, it just seems that without dependency on unstable drafts getting an RFC out there is considerably easier

[05:34:02.0000] <annevk>
it can always be updated later once everything is in place

[05:35:00.0000] <hallvors>
/me notes that about:blank must be a document in quirks mode with no whitespace in body except for a BR tag.. or something like that :-p

[05:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hallvors: why quirks mode?

[05:37:00.0000] <hallvors>
we've got bugs when editors set designMode on and apply CSS, apparently quirksmode is/was expected .. ;-] 

[05:37:01.0000] <hallvors>
I think

[05:37:02.0000] <xydyx>
hsivonen: checking for "JAVA_HOME" not in os.environ in buildAll or buildJing should work

[05:37:03.0000] <hallvors>
but that's from memory so I may be plain wrong. Perhaps it was the other way around, even.

[05:38:00.0000] <annevk>
you're right, though zcorpan discovered another potential fix

[05:38:01.0000] <annevk>
but quirks mode seems safer

[05:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hallvors: i only recall one bug (which didn't actually use css but the result was "broken" because of p's default margins)

[05:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
how would they apply css to about:blank?

[05:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh by inserting elements with script

[05:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>

You should use Gentoo, then you could set USE=-latex and it wouldn't need those dependencies

for some reason I had trouble getting to this channel, so I asked a question on W3C's html-wg irc channel, but this channel is more active usually, so I guess I can ask here and the message on html-wg can be ignored

[13:15:01.0000] <alyoshka>
What is the <figure><legend> supposed to look like by default? does it look like the <fieldset><legend> or does it have the caption(legend) at the bottom like the classic photography style?

[13:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
we don't know yet

[13:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[13:17:00.0000] <alyoshka>
uhh...that leaves me with a problem on how to fix it in older browsers.lol

[13:18:00.0000] <alyoshka>
well, is there any special behavior that current graphical browsers don't have for it? Last time I checked, there wasn't, but maybe I need to look again

[13:19:00.0000] <alyoshka>
I always imagined it looking like an inline-block element with the caption under the image

[13:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
alyoshka: it should be block-level, but yeah, other than that that's basically it

[13:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
alyoshka: probably legend above if the legend is at the top, and below otherwise

[13:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
you could center the resource and the legend, too

[13:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me 's web page collection is far too old :-(

[13:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries downloading another hundred thousand

[13:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
so probably, like:  figure, figure > legend { text-align: center; margin: 0 auto; display: block; }

[13:46:00.0000] <alyoshka>
OK, makes sense

[13:48:00.0000] <alyoshka>
for default settings. and I figure the legend would be more of plain text rather than the way <fieldset><legend> works

[13:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, no default borders or anything

[13:51:00.0000] <alyoshka>
what about <details><legend>? no borders, but just open/close action for all contents, right?

[13:53:00.0000] <alyoshka>
<details><legend>You don't...</legend> want to know the details</details> would render "You don't..." without a style by default except maybe looking like a hyperlink?

[13:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
are you familiar with the Mac OS X "disclosure triangle" widget?

[13:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's what I had in mind when speccing <details>

[14:06:00.0000] <alyoshka>
um, I think I know what you're talking about, Gnome has the same thing too (if I understood what you're talking about)

I'm primarily a KDE user tho

[14:07:00.0000] <ap>

[14:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
so does anyone know what IE8's "clickjacking protection" consists of?

[14:35:00.0000] <alyoshka>
apparently it's a tag a developer puts in the document that prevents IE8 from ever framing the page

[14:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was hoping for someone who knew what the "tag" was :-)

[14:38:00.0000] <heycam>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=475530 claims it's actually the "X-I-Do-Not-Want-To-Be-Framed-Across-Domains" header

[14:39:00.0000] <heycam>
should be simple to test, i guess

[14:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
that doesn't solve clickjacking, unless you consider "not having a car" to be a solution to "it's possible for someone to break into my car"

[14:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
if it is what they did, though, i'm amused -- that was originally a Google proposal on the WHATWG list

[14:41:00.0000] <heycam>
and presumably a strawman header name

[14:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me 's new download storage format is sufficiently less dumb that his old format that it now takes 15 seconds to scan through 130K pages, rather than ten minutes

[14:43:00.0000] <alyoshka>
such a funny name for the header

[14:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
...although I appear to have a page which sends the Validator.nu parser into either an infinite or a very slow loop

[14:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2009Jan/0132.html "Most RDFa parsers are able to handle broken XHTML" ...

[14:43:03.0000] <alyoshka>
I hate having pages that needed to have something pasted in them every time

[14:44:00.0000] <alyoshka>
one reason I hated the XHTML doctypes

[14:44:01.0000] <alyoshka>
it's very easy to get a typo when typing that into the page, so I would usually paste it

[14:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Who needs parsing specs when you can just pass everything through Tidy or whatever other tool you happen to have lying around?

[14:45:01.0000] <alyoshka>
but with the header it's more important not to make a typo, since it actually does something, unlike the doctype

[14:56:00.0000] <annevk>
broken XHTML, is that like invalid XHTML?

[14:56:01.0000] <annevk>
please don't answer, I'm being needlessly pedantic

[14:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes how his Java stuff now uses ~390% CPU, rather than being constantly blocked on IO

[14:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but I don't like how it makes it hard for me to find this maybe-infinite loop :-( )

[14:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
can't you figure out which page is doing it?

[15:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm trying to, but it's taking me far too much effort

[15:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
My current attempt is to set each thread's name to the URL it's currently processing, and then I can use ctrl-\ to print a stack trace of all the threads once it's got to the end and has one stuck

[15:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
just run them all on one thread and output the url before each one

[15:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
That would probably be sensible, but it'd take much longer to run

[15:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
Found it now, so that's okay

[15:12:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, what is the normalization issue with Selectors?

[15:12:01.0000] <annevk>
I suppose I can imagine some myself

[15:12:02.0000] <annevk>
/me hopes there is no normalization whatsoever

[15:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, looks like the page's body randomly stopped and then was followed by a quarter of a megabyte of null bytes

[15:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
(a quarter of a megabyte being the limit I imposed on the response body lengths)

[15:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
and that happened to be in the middle of a table just after a </tr>

[15:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it wants to foster-parent a quarter of a million characters

[15:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
and presumably there's some non-linear behaviour in there

[15:26:00.0000] <annevk>
interesting testcase

[15:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
The actual page itself looks fine, it might have just been a weird artifact of my downloader

[15:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It'd be nice if foster-parenting didn't take seemingly non-linear amounts of time in SAXTreeBuilder.insertCharactersBefore

[15:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
All U+0000 NULL characters in the input must be replaced by U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs. Any occurrences of such characters is a parse error.

[15:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Test case: http://philip.html5.org/misc/table-fostering.html shouldn't take multiple seconds to parse with HtmlParser(XmlViolationPolicy.ALLOW)

"Creative Commons Attribuzione-Non opere derivate 2.5 Italia License" apparently translates into "Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 2.5 Canada License"

[16:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, that's the risk with that learning method

[16:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
It makes it really hard to trust the results, when they might arbitrarily substitute the semantics with something completely different

[16:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
not completely different

[16:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's the same, it's just it's using a different point of reference

[16:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
When you think somebody's talking about one particular country, and the translation service gives the appearance of great confidence, when actually they're talking about a different country, that's not really good at all if it's a situation where you care what the person is talking about

[16:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not saying it's useful :-)

[16:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's like if a car repair shop replaced your tires with big round rocks

[16:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
"what, it's a wheel! why are you complaining!"

[16:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
you wanted them replaced, so they replaced them with something equivalent -- a round thing with no air in it

[16:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
sadly the "air" part was the part you cared about, and you wanted it replaced with something equivalent -- a round rubber thing designed to hold air

[16:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's not like that at all, because it's immediately obvious if your car has big round rocks instead of tires

[16:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
It's more like they replaced your petrol engine with a diesel engine and didn't tell you about it

[16:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
there you go

/me notices the revised melbourne weather forecast for the next two days: 43°C (=109°F)

[22:15:00.0000] <rubys1>
Lachy: re: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0433.html: Exactly.  :-)

[23:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: good catch. yes, indeed I made the time complexity of rare operations like insertBefore suck in order to make common operations as fast as I could make them

[23:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: this together with calling SAXTreeBuilder.insertCharactersBefore per character or so is not cool when your have a quarter million characters instead of a handful

[23:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
unfortunately, on the web there are so many different characteristics that it seems the only good algorithm is a uniformally fast one that doesn't use much memory and is secure. :-P

[23:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
at least it's only the SAX Tree insertBefore whose time complexity is intentionally bad--not the parser itself

[23:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: basically, the issue is that SAX Tree has only nextSibling links but not previousSibling links

[23:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
a streaming api with forward links on a tree? that sounds unbelievably painful. i assume i misunderstand.

[23:36:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, what a bunch of hopeless discussions on public-html

[23:36:01.0000] <annevk>
/me is glad he's not involved

[23:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: SAX Tree is an XML tree implementation that is optimized to be fast for building from SAX events and for replaying as SAX events

[23:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
fast building from sax events with forward links?

[23:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: for XML and for conforming HTML, you never need to traverse a previousSibling link

[23:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
how can that possibly be fast

[23:37:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: there's also a lastChild link for making append fast

[23:37:05.0000] <Hixie>
(for building)

[23:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i assume you can't access this tree while it's being built

[23:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it isn't meant to be accessed by anything but the tree builder while it's being built

[23:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[23:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
then i guess it can be built fast since you don't have to set the pointers until you're ready

[23:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it does set everything so that the tree is coherent after each operation

[23:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
so lastChild gets updated each time you add a node?

[23:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: That sounds like a plausible explanation

[23:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yes

[23:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I think it's still a bug even if it's by design :-)

[23:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
and there's a stack of nodes waiting for their nextSibling to be set?

[23:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: no

[23:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
so how is nextSibling set?

[23:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: take the lastChild of parent, set its nextSibling, set the lastChild of parent to the new sibling

[23:42:03.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: If this only affects the foster-parenting case, could you do something like cache a reference to the node that's just before the table, so you don't have to search for it again every time you insert a bit more?

[23:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: possibly

[23:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: fair enough

[23:48:00.0000] <BenMillard>
IE Blog gives details of their counter-clickjacking mechanism: http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/01/27/ie8-security-part-vii-clickjacking-defenses.aspx

[23:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"Web developers can send a HTTP response header named X-FRAME-OPTIONS with HTML pages to restrict how the page may be framed."

[23:49:01.0000] <BenMillard>
"[...] E8 will prevent the page from rendering if it will be contained within a frame."

[23:49:02.0000] <BenMillard>
oops, I mean "[...] IE8 will prevent the page from rendering if it will be contained within a frame."

[23:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
"[...] a local error page is presented that explains the restriction and provides a link which opens the frame in a new window." ouch

[23:50:01.0000] <BenMillard>
perhaps it means s/new window/current window/ although the screenshot could be showing either

[23:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's going to make your page work really well in e.g. Google Cache or Translate

[23:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually won't affect google cache

[23:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
gonna be a bitch in image search though

[23:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
and reddit's toolbar mode

[23:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
and so on

[23:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
ah yes: "If the value contains the token SAMEORIGIN, IE will block rendering only if the origin of the top level-browsing-context is different than the origin of the content containing the X-FRAME-OPTIONS directive."

[23:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's the equivalent of saying "we're going to stop the problem of people breaking the encryption on our remote car key fobs by allowing people to not have a remote car key fob"

[23:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oops, yes, don't know why I thought of Cache

[23:54:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Hixie, you're really getting into these car analogies. :)

[23:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.ourcampaigns.com/cgi-bin/r.cgi/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=6993 - some kind of graph thing

[00:00:00.0000] <BenMillard>
Philip`, it was a good idea to recollect web pages, glad to see you've done that and cool that it'll perform better. B)

[00:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.city-data.com/city/Hubbard-Lake-Michigan.html plus a load more from the same site - more graphs

/me tries to resist the temptation to download more pages until it gets really slow again

[00:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I guess the main reason it's much faster is that it's now 600MB instead of 3.1GB to store the 130K pages, so it can all be buffered in RAM pretty easily)

[00:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
aw man, i'm so gonna have to restructure the innerHTML/document.write section

[00:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
I wonder what a better way to organise that section would be

[00:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
(http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dynamic-markup-insertion)

[00:18:02.0000] <jruderman>
"Don't. But if you do..."

[00:18:03.0000] <annevk>
it might help if you explain why

[00:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
the current structure defines the apis twice, once for xml and once for html, with the two sets in two different sections

[00:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think what would be simpler is to have one section per api point, and have the definition of the html and xml versions together.

[00:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
for each one.

[00:19:03.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: I'm not sure searching for occurences of <canvas in your corpus is an accurate means of measuring

[00:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
that way you don't have to have the table at the top to work out where on earth the feature is, etc.

[00:21:00.0000] <annevk>
Dynamic Stream Insertion and Dynamic Fragment Insertion or some such?

[00:21:01.0000] <annevk>
seems easy enough to merge the rest

[00:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was thinking more like "document.write" "innerHTML" "outerHTML" and "insertAdjacentHTML"

[00:23:00.0000] <annevk>
that would certainly make TOC searching easier :)

[00:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7853400.stm - "In 2007, the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency) raised £83m by auctioning off previously unissued numbers." - I wish I could work out how to make a fortune by selling arbitrary numbers that have zero intrinsic value

[00:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
HTML5 needs to add some centrally-adminstered artificially scarce resources; the domain name people have got the right idea

[00:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
what do you think i'm refusing to allow extensibility of the element names?

[00:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: Depends what you're measuring - it's a fairly accurate means of measuring how many pages listed on dmoz.org use a <canvas> element in their markup :-)

[00:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
and it's not too hopelessly inaccurate to extrapolate that to a larger portion of the web

[00:52:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: yes, as long as you don't conflate use of <canvas> with use of canvas

[00:54:00.0000] <virtuelv>
also I suspect use of canvas is bigger off the traditional web

[00:54:01.0000] <virtuelv>
look at widgets/gadgets

[00:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: I think it's hard for me to find scripted uses of <canvas> since I haven't downloaded any scripts

[00:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
though I don't suppose there's any real reason why I couldn't add code to download scripts

[00:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
other than laziness

[01:00:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: so, with the new redaction of the appcache spec, all HTML documents in an application need to have a manifest attribute, not just the main one. why is this helpful?

[01:02:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I thought of the manifest attribute as something that was only needed once, at the root level

[01:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's always how it's been, no? as far as i recall it's always has been my intent. why would you serve a page differently based purely on whether you'd loaded another page first?

[01:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand what you mean

[01:03:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: I'm fairly sure that previously, a document that was loaded from cache and that didn't have a manifest attribute was associated to the cache, and not marked as foreign

[01:03:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: and that seemed like reasonable behavior to me

[01:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm

[01:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also: XHTML is dying - I saw 39 pages sent as application/xhtml+xml a year ago, and only 35 yesterday

[01:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Don't bother telling me about standard deviations or any of that nonsense - it's definitely dying!)

[01:04:03.0000] <ap>
Hixie: "serve a page differently based purely on whether you'd loaded another page first" - sure, it's a part of a locally installed offline application

[01:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
so once a page has had a manifest, even if you remove the manifest="" attribute, it'll keep being served from that manifest?

[01:06:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: yes - I think I asked you about this a couple of weeks ago, and you answered that the manifest must become 404, and that's the only way

[01:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok well fair enough :-)

[01:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
ap: can you drop me a mail? i'm in the middle of a big reorg and i'm going to go to bed before i finish it.

[01:09:01.0000] <ap>
Hixie: will do

[01:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[01:38:00.0000] <annevk>
on twitter someone asked about getElementsByAttribute()

[01:38:01.0000] <annevk>
seems more like a Web DOM addition

[01:38:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan ^^

[01:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: sigh. still rampant point missing on the alt topic

[01:42:00.0000] <annevk>
I was mostly amused by that post "and the number of people on earth who care about valid HTML — but don’t care even a little about accessibility — could fit into my pants"

[01:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
where's the spec for CSS :not()?

[01:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/ apparently

[01:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, we have querySelectorAll("[attribute]");

[01:51:00.0000] <annevk>
not live

[01:51:01.0000] <annevk>
but yeah

[01:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: why would anyone actually *want* live?

[01:51:03.0000] <hsivonen>
liveness is a design bug, IMO

[01:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I guess that looks weird if taken out of context

[01:56:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, svg > video, svg :not(foreignObject) > video

[01:56:01.0000] <annevk>
and remove the > from the second selector

[01:56:02.0000] <annevk>
I think that would work fine

[01:57:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, ^^

[01:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: does that mean that none of the elements between svg and video is foreignObject or that there is at least one element there that isn't foreignObject?

[01:58:00.0000] <annevk>
you're right, it wouldn't work

[01:58:01.0000] <annevk>
:/

[01:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, hsivonen, the only way to make it work effectively is to do this:

[01:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
"svg>a,

[01:59:02.0000] <Lachy>
 svg>:not(foreignObject)>a

[01:59:03.0000] <Lachy>
 svg>:not(foreignObject)>:not(foreignObject)>a

[01:59:04.0000] <Lachy>
 svg>:not(foreignObject)>:not(foreignObject)>:not(foreignObject)>a

[01:59:05.0000] <Lachy>
 ..."

[01:59:06.0000] <annevk>
indeed :/

[01:59:07.0000] <annevk>
given that this use case is extremely minor anyway, it does not seem worth the effort

[02:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
given that no use cases have been presented yet, indeed

[02:06:00.0000] <annevk>
http://twitter.com/grorg/status/1131211278 :)

[02:08:00.0000] <Lachy>

[02:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, what are you coming to Oslo for and how long are you staying?

[02:09:01.0000] <annevk>
meeting up with chaals and marcos, mostly

[02:09:02.0000] <annevk>
staying until Feb 15

[02:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
cool. You're arriving just in time for the Global Village thing that Opera's doing for Friday beer this week

[02:12:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, I heard that was on but wasn't sure whether I would want to represent the Dutch there :)

[02:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
"this discussion is going to become unbelievably verbose and tedious." - why use future tense?

[02:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: No comment

[02:59:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm not really against the markup language specification, but it feels dodgy that nobody just says what it is for. Given that several people want it to be normative without really explaning why makes it seem like there is a hidden agenda.

[02:59:01.0000] <annevk>
s/explaning/explaining/

[03:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, the hidden adgenda is to use it as leverage to split the language definition from the implementation requirements

[03:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, I guess it's not so hidden really

[03:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: if that's the agenda, it would be forthcoming to say that that indeed is the agenda, who wants it and why

[03:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: I have nothing against the markup language spec existing in non-normative form either. But people indeed seem to be wedded to the idea of it being normative despite the substantive arguments made against that

[03:09:00.0000] <annevk>
the main problem is that they're not explaining why; they use side step arguments such as that is not important to decide right now, etc.

[03:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
I wonder if it is percieved as a way to reduce the influence of browser vendors

[03:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: Gregory seems to perceive it that way: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2009Jan/0060.html

[03:20:00.0000] <annevk>
"fullblown spec" how neutral

[03:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, with the moratorium on discussing spec splitting still effective within the group, discussing why isn't really an option yet. The point seems to be to sneak this through without having such a discussion

[03:25:01.0000] <rubys1>
i disagree

[03:25:02.0000] <rubys1>
the point is what annevk said a few hours ago

[03:26:00.0000] <rubys1>
"wow, what a bunch of hopeless discussions on public-html"

[03:27:00.0000] <rubys1>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0453.html

[03:28:00.0000] <annevk>
hold on, I'm about to contribute... o_O

[03:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
rubys1, we have "an express lane" list already. It's called whatwg

[03:30:01.0000] <rubys1>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Are_there_plans_to_merge_the_groups.3F

[03:31:00.0000] <rubys1>
/me wonders why /nick rubys doesn't work...

[03:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
rubys1, have you registered "rubys"?

[03:32:00.0000] <annevk>
there is a rubys already

[03:33:00.0000] <rubys>
ah, better

[03:39:00.0000] <rubys>
I am deeply skeptical that splitting the spec is possible.  But "rational" discussion on the topic (which seems rare these days) isn't convincing anyone.  I'd like to give the peole who wish to do so equal opportunity to succeed.  We've noted that section 1.5.4 in hixie's draft sucks and moved on.  I'd like to note that section 1.3 of Smith's draft sucks and move on.

[03:40:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, I agree that complaining about that section is the wrong thing to do here

[03:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
But so far, unlike Hixie, Mike hasn't indicated that he will be revising that particular section in due course, and also unlike Hixie, Mike doesn't have a 6 month backlog to get through first

[03:41:01.0000] <annevk>
rubys, the problem seems to be that Mike is not upfront about why it needs to be normative

[03:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: I am sympathetic to that desire but it seems, at least, highl unusual for a W3C group to have two WDs that claim normativity about the same thing

[03:41:03.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, still, that section is not the reason people do not want to publish the draft

[03:42:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, also, several people have already stated they like that draft regardless of what that section says

[03:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, but we need to understand the intended audience and scope in order to understand the purpose of it and why it needs to be normative

[03:42:02.0000] <rubys>
jgraham: it is highly unusual to have one working draft that doesn't operate based on consensus.  This working group is destined to be unusual.

[03:43:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, it seems better to just ask why it needs to be normative  than to approach it indirectly

[03:43:01.0000] <rubys>
what I would like to do is capture an Issue on whether it needs to be normative or not, and block the draft from progressing past a WD state until that point is addressed.

[03:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, how about asking Mike to move forward with the draft as a non-normative FPWD at this stage, which will allow for wider, formal public review. And then if compelling evidence is presented for it to become normative later, it's easier to move it on to the REC track at that time

[03:45:00.0000] <rubys>
Lachy: how about I ask that Ian does the same?  (no: I am *not* serious)

[03:45:01.0000] <annevk>
rubys, I have the feeling that leaving that unaddressed will make many people object which will then be subsequently be ignored because TimBL is in favor (well, I have that feeling, anyway)

[03:45:02.0000] <annevk>
rubys, but I suppose that if you want to get it published and cwilso agrees none of that should be an issue anyway

[03:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, I'm not sure even TimBL could get away with ignoring all the formal objections that seem likely to come from Mozilla, WebKit and presumably Opera, and many other individuals, if it goes forward with a normative status.

[03:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: It doesn't seem too unreasonable to treat all "incubator" projects as non-normative until they have proven their worth. So far the group has decided that HTML 5 ("Hixie's Document") has worth in fulfilling our charter requirements

[03:49:00.0000] <takkaria>
/me sighs

[03:49:01.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, we'll see; it seems most people have made their mind up so I guess we'll know soon enough unless something changes

[03:49:02.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, not sure I'd raise a FO over this by the way

[03:51:00.0000] <rubys>
jgraham: this group is clearly not all of one mind on "Hixie's document".

[03:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, I think we should. But we can discuss that if and when the question arises

[03:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: No but we had a vote and so on. I don't think we will do better than that on anything.

[03:53:00.0000] <rubys>
we had a vote.  I even participated and eventually said yes.

[03:53:01.0000] <rubys>
the vote was on publishing a draft.

[03:53:02.0000] <rubys>
the vote was not on blocking others from doing the same

[03:54:00.0000] <annevk>
that's a strawman

[03:55:00.0000] <rubys>
I am very serious that I doubt that splitting the spec will be feasible.  My site isn't called intertwingly for nothing.

[03:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: The vote was on adopting HTML 5 as the basis for our deliverable "A language evolved from HTML4 for describing the semantics of documents and applications on the World Wide Web"

[03:55:02.0000] <rubys>
(and, no, that's not a strawman)

[03:55:03.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: That deliverable must presumably have normative content

[03:56:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, "the vote was not on blocking others from doing the same" is a misrepresentation of the other's opinion afaict

[03:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, why is your site called intertwingly? What does it mean?

[03:56:02.0000] <rubys>
annevk: fair enough

[03:57:00.0000] <rubys>
lachy: it facinates me that the further I delve into any topic, the more I am convinced that what some people view as clean layers turn out to be interdependent in a very twisted way.

[03:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, is intertwingly a portmanteau of "intertwined" and something else?

[03:59:00.0000] <rubys>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertwingularity

[04:00:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, you'd have fun being on the TAG

[04:00:01.0000] <rubys>
no I would not

[04:00:02.0000] <annevk>
;)

[04:08:00.0000] <rubys>
oh, cool.  I had forgotten that my blog is actually linked off of that wiki page

[04:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
parts of some recent discussions remind me of the made, way back when, against the Web API WG publishing the Web Forms 2.0 draft as a WD

[04:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
s/of the made/of the objections that were made/

[04:12:00.0000] <rubys>
and how did that work out?

[04:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the group published it, over the objections

[04:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
objections that went right up to the Director and the CEO and just about everybody else under the sun

[04:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and which were stated in what some described in a fairly strident and shrill tone

[04:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
s/described/described as being/

[04:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
denial-of-spec attacks are a lot more fun to watch from the sidelines

[04:18:00.0000] <annevk>
I tried staying out of this debate, but I have to say, that is a rather different story

[04:19:00.0000] <annevk>
WF2 defined new functionality for HTML4, XHTML1, and DOM2HTML forms. It did not define, say, a subset of SVG that just describes the markup language in a normative way.

[04:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I wasn't trying to say that it was the same kind of spec debate

[04:20:01.0000] <annevk>
okidoki

[04:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I was referring more to the character of parts the debate, and the nature of the way the objections were stated

[04:23:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, objecting to the audience section is silly

[04:24:00.0000] <rubys>
Ian's objection is sane and appropriate.  It should be noted, tabled (in the American sense of the word), and revisited at the appropriate time.

[04:25:00.0000] <annevk>
well, it might be an issue, but it's not the kind of issue that would stop publication

[04:25:01.0000] <rubys>
I very much like the way Ian points to specific sections in Mike's document and questions their readability.

[04:25:02.0000] <annevk>
if that's the case for not knowing the intent of the spec (why it needs to be normative) is a harder question imo

[04:26:00.0000] <rubys>
My take, and I will openly admit that it is just my take: many people here take it as a given that Ian's document will progress, and that previous votes entitle it to do so at the exclusion of all other proposals.

[04:27:00.0000] <rubys>
I do *not* see it as a given that Ian's draft will progress any further than as a Working Group Note.

[04:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
rubys: yeah, definitely. hard to argue that the regex Hixie pointed out isn't horribly ugly

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, I did have the feeling the HTML WG was formed to work on that document, yes, but I see your point

[04:29:00.0000] <rubys>
http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#tr-end

[04:31:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm familiar with that document

[04:31:01.0000] <rubys>
lol.

[04:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rubys: as far as the wrongness of that regex, it may well be wrong. I don't know, because I didn't write it. Or at least I don't think I did.

[04:32:01.0000] <rubys>
"I don't know" is a very profound statement, and goes to the heart of Ian's argument.

[04:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: Indeed. Practically it is hard to see how we can fulfil our charter without producing something substantially like Hixie's Document. If we don't fulfill our charter then the group will have failed which, I think would be very bad for W3C

[04:34:00.0000] <rubys>
jgraham: Putting aside the question of feasibility for a moment, I claim that a set of four documents that collectively cover the same material that Ian's does is "something substantially like Hixie's Document"

[04:34:01.0000] <rubys>
(no special meaning is intended by the number four, I could have picked twelve)

[04:36:00.0000] <rubys>
I found it very amusing that Roy Fielding chose to name his weblog "Untangled".

[04:36:01.0000] <annevk>
heh

[04:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: Well yes. That just follows if you believe that Hixie's document covers basically what we are required to cover.

[04:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Of course not all possible splittings will result in combined works that are equally useful

[04:38:00.0000] <rubys>
...including the one that puts everything into a single doc

[04:38:01.0000] <annevk>
I guess the idea might be to remove the need for Hixie being editor. DanC did talk about that in the past if I remember correctly...

[04:39:00.0000] <rubys>
I do *not* think that removing Hixie would be a good idea.

[04:39:01.0000] <rubys>
I also very much appreciate that he is not standing in the way of others

[04:39:02.0000] <annevk>
Would be cool if the W3C Team just stated that doing the markup language thing was part of fulfilling that goal... Or if not, what the goal is.

[04:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"removing" Hixie as editor is a non-goal

[04:41:00.0000] <rubys>
Given that we have people willing to do the work, I would much rather be in a position to pick from the best (and to cross-polinate as much as possible) than to proceed in a waterfall fashion.

[04:42:00.0000] <rubys>
If splitting out the markup language is not technically feasible (and that has not been proven at this point), then I would much rather not establish that as a goal.

[04:46:00.0000] <annevk>
but splitting up the specification in markup language, API, parsing bits, etc. is somewhat of a goal?

[04:47:00.0000] <annevk>
it's certainly possible, with enough cross-references

[04:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees the main problem as being that people are implementing tools based on the current HTML5 draft, and people outside the WG are writing tutorials and pages based on it, and publishing two different drafts and giving them equal normative weight seems likely to cause confusion among those people because they wouldn't know which to rely on

[04:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Nobody cares that the current draft is just a draft and could change at any time - they still want to rely on it like they would on a published Recommendation)

[04:48:01.0000] <rubys>
Philip`: if they are consistent, it doesn't matter.  If they aren't that's a bug.

[04:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: Even if they're consistent, I can imagine it would be confusing to people if it wasn't clear which one they should read

[04:50:00.0000] <takkaria>
it can be made clear, I'm sure

[04:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: But that could probably be solved by having a clear statement somewhere about the relationship between the documents

[04:50:02.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: That implies that the publication of the Markup Language spec as a normative FPWD places a significant burden on the group to keep them in sync at all times 

[04:51:00.0000] <rubys>
jgraham: What implies that?

[04:51:01.0000] <rubys>
or are you merely asserting that?

[04:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. the Markup Language spec could state that it's been derived largely from implementations and has had far less review than the other document, and in case of discrepancies you should prefer the other document, and this document is just here as a work-in-progress attempt to make an easier-to-read document and if you think it's easier/harder to read then please send feedback etc

[04:53:00.0000] <rubys>
I like that

[04:53:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: http://simon.html5.org/dump/daddy2.svg http://simon.html5.org/dump/daddy3.svg - smaller and smaller still versions (the latter is a bit less accurate though)

[04:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
rubys: I guess I as making the assumption that the group doesn't want to unnecessarily confuse people who are interested in, and perhaps relying on, our work

[04:55:00.0000] <rubys>
Labelling the controversial areas (in both documents, BTW) is an excellent idea.

[04:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't care whether there's a line at the top saying "This document is informative" or "This document is non-normative", because he doesn't see that it makes any difference in practice

I've learned to love firebug for that same purpose.

[05:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rubys: have you used the Web Inspector in WebKit? and/or Opera Dragonfly?

[05:13:00.0000] <rubys>
Haven't found a version of webkit that runs well on Ubuntu; haven't tried Dragonfly.

[05:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: I like your wording above ("...derived largely from implementations and has had far less review", etc.)

[05:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
rubys: arora

[05:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's fairly simple UI

[05:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but includes a Web Inspector UI

[05:14:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
requires Qt

[05:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://code.google.com/p/arora/

sweet: $ apt-cache search arora

[05:15:02.0000] <rubys>

[05:16:01.0000] <rubys>
something new to play with when I get back home

[05:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
The WebKit Gtk+ port seems nice, but I don't know if a nice browser interface exists for it

[05:16:03.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: I don't like my wording at all :-)

[05:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
or at least I don't like the words

[05:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
but the concepts seem useful to convey to casual readers

[05:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and it would explain why e.g. some of the regexps are so ugly)

[05:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[05:18:01.0000] <rubys>
I'm not thrilled with "prefer the other document".  I like simple statements of facts that allow people to make informed judgements.

[05:18:02.0000] <rubys>
Openly state all the failings of the document, up front, and without any histrionics.

[05:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
The webkit-gtk demo browser turns out to be nice if you like minimal; it seems to have a back button, a forward button and a location bar

[05:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
and that's it

[05:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, I'm wondering how much effect the LPGL'ing of Qt is going to have on the future of Gtk 

[05:19:03.0000] <jgraham>
Oh and the location bar seems to be broken :)

[05:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
No wait, I forgot the http://

[05:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it could say something more "this document is derived from implementations that are derived from the other spec", which might sufficiently imply that the other spec is more authoritative

[05:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/more/more like/

[05:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
and s/derived/partly derived/g

[05:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
and "authoritative" is probably not the right word either

[05:21:01.0000] <rubys>
there's more a symbionic relationship that that doesn't reflect.  Henri's implementation has certainly exposed a number of issues that has caused Hixies draft to be improved.

[05:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'd wonder what the webkit-gtk demo browser relies on for other non-UI stuff, like caching, cookies, network code 

[05:22:01.0000] <rubys>
At a much higher level, it is also true that Hixie's draft have been dervied largely from implementations...

[05:22:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
right

[05:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: The minimalist demo browser relies on the seemingly quite complete WebKit/Gtk+ port, which seems to use libraries like those listed at http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/BuildingGtk#MacOSX

[05:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
(e.g. cURL for networking)

[05:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
you could just as well say that the whattf.org schema is "derived from" HTML4

[05:23:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
or from the set of HTML that is supported in the real world in browsers 

[05:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
epiphany-webkit also seems to work quite well but is a bit minimalist even for my tastes

[05:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
rubys: You could always use Safari in Wine :-)

[05:25:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, cool, they both seem fine

[06:58:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, any chance you'll visit Oslo in the next two weeks?

[06:58:01.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure how to get that memory card to you

[06:59:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
rubys: http://simon.html5.org/tools/js/svg-optimizer/

[07:00:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, maybe you should use a real parser :)

[07:00:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: yeah

[07:01:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it's very naïve, but it works

[07:02:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
this is the sort of interface i'd like to see when saving as svg in illustrator

[07:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: None that I know of

[07:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
I guess post should work?

[07:04:00.0000] <annevk>
that sounds boring

[07:04:01.0000] <annevk>
I'll put it in my bag so it gets to Oslo and then figure something out :)

[07:04:02.0000] <jgraham>
Well I am happy to wait for an interesting solution :)

[07:05:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: for correctness, not only is an xml parser required but also css parser and transform="" parser, and then having knowledge of what to scale and what not to scale

[07:05:01.0000] <annevk>
the interesting solution is me getting to Linköping, but that is not going to happen before March

[07:05:02.0000] <annevk>
(at least)

[07:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
rubys: it'd be nice to have smiilar interface for SVG tidy

[07:08:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
similar

[07:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: "XML parsing failed: syntax error (Line: 1, Character: 17)"

[07:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
<?xml version="1" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

[07:12:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: oops

[07:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: and if I set quality to 2, I get <?xml version="2" encoding="UTF-16" standalone="no"?>

[07:17:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: fixed

[07:22:00.0000] <rubys>
is the source to svg-optimizer available someplace?

[07:24:00.0000] <annevk>
rubys, view source :)

[07:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan_: Can't you just use the browser to parse the SVG?

[07:28:01.0000] <rubys>
hmmm.  maybe I should convert from ruby to javascript.

[07:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
jgraham: that only helps with the xml parsing part

[07:29:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
well and maybe css parsing part

[07:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
which are indeed the most annoying parts to implement

[07:48:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe i can work around the problems while still having a naïve implementation by looking at the previous few characters (notably "xmlns", "#", "rotate(", etc)

[07:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Are you intending this to be a quick hack, or a serious usable tool?

[07:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: the former

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
In that case, your suggestion does not sound insane :-)

[08:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: validator.nu doesn't seem too useful for validating svg since it doesn't seem to validate the css parts (e.g. stroke="#0" passes)

[09:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries to work out the difference between LaTeX's "quote" environment and its "quotation" environment

[09:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, apparently the latter adds paragraph indentation

[09:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Not much of a semantic difference really :-(

[09:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: do you edit LaTeX in a text editor, or use LyX or something?

[09:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Kile

[09:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: does it have table editor?

[09:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: which is a text editor with relevant buttons (like a list of fancy symbols) and some limited autocomplete, and key commands to run pdflatex and the PDF viewer

[09:25:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[09:25:03.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: It has a menu item which causes the text "\begin{tabular}{}  \end{tabular}" to be inserted into your document, and prints a brief syntax summary to a window at the bottom of the screen

[09:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[09:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: It's not exactly WYSIWYG

[09:26:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, sounds like

[09:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmph, Gmail tricked me into clicking an advert by making the little "New Message" popup window let my mouse clicks pass straight through

[09:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: is there a sane way to specify row spans and column spans in LaTeX?

[09:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: \multicolumn does colspans and sounds reasonably sane

[09:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: I don't know about rowspans, and Kile's help page doesn't mention them at all

[09:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://osdir.com/ml/tex.brazilian/2003-04/msg00069.html suggests using \raisebox to have a cell contain a value that is lying about how tall it is and thus will overlap the following rows

[09:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
but that doesn't sound entirely sane

[09:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: tbl tool that groff relies on relies on a markup mechanism where you have to specify the table structure in a sort of ascii prologue to the table itself. really seems to me like the worst way to do it

[09:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
for the man-page thing I did, I wrote an HTML-to-tbl converter

[09:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which would really have been just dead simple except for needing to deal with generating the arcane table prologue thing for the case where there are rowspans or colspan

[09:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
It seems a reasonable way when the table has a consistent structure - for each row you just want to be entering the data, not worrying about writing all the right cell divisions and spacings and lines and everything

[09:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
true

[09:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
so in LaTeX you write something ugly like \begin{tabular}{r|l|l|l|l|l|l} at the start, but then each data row is just like "$S$ & $S$ & $\otimes$ & $M$ & $\Diamond$ & $\Diamond$ \\"

[09:46:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Ugly.

[09:46:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, that's pretty much like what tbl requires

You wouldn't want to write a web page with nested layout tables in LaTeX

[09:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: I live.

[09:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I've never written directly in LaTeX or groff, so I never really considered the markup from the perspective of actually writing it

[09:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
(You only need those "$"s if you're writing everything in math mode, not for normal plain text tables)

[09:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
just instead from perspective of converting into it

[09:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: I'm glad :)

[09:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Got to remember the priorities of constituencies :-)

[09:48:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: so the "SVG likely for IE9" statement was never actually made in IE chat?

[09:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: It was said it was something that had been requested a lot. Nothing more was said.

[09:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: (requested wrt IE9)

[09:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[09:49:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Requested wrt IE8 too)

[09:49:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: have you used ConTeXt?

[09:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: No

[09:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems like there's all kinds of crazy cool stuff in that

[09:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
"including extensive support for colors, backgrounds, hyperlinks, presentations, figure-text integration, and conditional compilation"

[09:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
Those don't sound like things I'd personally find useful

[09:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
and anyway I'm mostly attempting to write things for conferences, who provide LaTeX style files that you really ought to use

[10:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: I see. yeah, I guess ConTeXt is more focused on producing PDFs

[10:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Those who forget HTML4 are doomed to repeat it

[10:30:00.0000] <jcranmer>
what abou those who forget HTML 1?

[10:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
HTML1's lessons are part of HTML4

[10:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But really, when it's hard enough to state something clearly and correctly in one place, attempting to do it twice with different sentences is madness.

[12:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think it is time for me to just bite the bullet and write an "xml parser" spec-like-thing for html5

[12:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
not like the html parser, of course

[12:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
but defining things like the steps for parsing a fragment

[12:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
serialising a fragmen

[12:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
etc

[12:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
basically the XML<->DOM glue spec

[12:35:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Based on xml5?

[12:35:06.0000] <Hixie>
no

[12:35:07.0000] <Hixie>
this wouldn't be defining anything new

[12:35:08.0000] <gsnedders>
Or just defining XML 1.0 parsing?

[12:35:09.0000] <Hixie>
it would just simplify the spec a lot

[12:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
not defining any parsing

[12:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
just how to glue the xml rules to the dom

it didn't take many steps to get out of ASCII

i was tempted to do it myself but i've had bad luck pasting non-ASCII into Terminal -> screen -> irssi

[15:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
I find it works fine once I've set LANG to be something with utf8

It'll be nice in the future when we can always take Unicode support for granted

[15:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
most people already can

[15:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's only in the legacy guts like the command line that we have issues really

hey, Hixie, I added a scope and audience statment to the authoring guide.  Do you think this accurately covers who it's for? http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#scope

[15:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
oops, I should either finish or remove that last sentence of the audience section

[15:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems fine except that last sentence

[15:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll remove it cause I can't think of a useful way to finish it

[15:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me attempts to coax some real use cases for adding namespace support to selectors api. Not having much luck.

[15:49:00.0000] <rubys>
namespace as in xml?

[15:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
rubys, yes. The ability to do document.querySelector("svg|a", namespaceResolver);

[15:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
so far, my assessment is that the majority of use cases can be done without worrying about namespaces, since most localName's don't clash between HTML, SVG and MathML, and where they do, there are trivial workarounds

[18:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
man my next checkin is gonna ruffle some feathers

[18:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
why?

[18:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm defining the term "xml parser"

[18:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[18:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
the text itself isn't controversial (i hope)

[18:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
but apparently none of the people i'm worried about complaining actually read the text

[18:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm trying to find the definition in the spec /current-work/source, but I can't find it.

[18:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'll just wait till you check it in

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
check /current-work/working-copy

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
i no longer edit /source live, i edit /working-copy live instead, so that i can resume editing before the update script has finished syncing everything and so that i can them check in the previous changes without the new edits going in as well

[18:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, so is /source copied from /working-copy and then the scripts use that copy?

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[18:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I just saw the note here is missing the ')' from the end. http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dynamic-markup-insertion

[18:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
thx

[18:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
"An XML parser, for the purposes of this specification, is a construct that follows the rules given in the XML specification to map a string of bytes or characters into a Document  object." - doesn't seem controversial

[18:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
like i said, the text is fine :-)

[18:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, I guess it is controversial for those who believe an XML parser should be completely independent of the DOM and that it may not output a Document object

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
it'll be controversial because "it defines the term xml parser!!! aaah!!!"

[18:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, will attributes like name be defined, or at least listed, in the Obsolete Features section? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#obsolete-features

[18:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
I guess, since it defines some such attributes already

[18:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
it might be worth pointing that out to Roy

[18:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wasn't planning on making any author-facing statements in that section

[18:33:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, ok

[18:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
i was going to keep it at the bare minimum of implementation requirements

[18:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, I suppose providing authoring information about obsolete features doesn't really benefit anyone

[18:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think it's bed time. Tomorrow, I want to try and make some significant progress on the authoring guide

[18:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

Hixie, wtf happened here? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/

[18:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
the spec is in a poor state right now

[19:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[19:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone wants to review http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/index-diff while i'm at dinner, that'd be great :-D

[22:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: maybe you should move the doctype stuff in xml from conformance requirements to writing xhtml documents?

[22:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, not a bad idea

[01:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hey wait a minute. onclick etc listen for any 'click' events, not only MouseEvents?

[01:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i.e. if i dispatch a 'click' event with the wrong type, onclick will catch it

[01:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
geez that makes testing a whole lot easier

[01:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i had started to set up a mapping between event names and their interface and a mapping between interfaces and the appropriate initFooEvent method

[01:18:01.0000] <zcorpan>
now i can drop both tables and just do createEvent('Event') and then initEvent(e, true, true, window)

[01:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wish someone told me this before

[01:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i wonder why dom events have so much indirection

[01:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(not to mention that there's initFooEventNS with another level of indirection)

[01:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: might be worth adding a note to the spec saying that the event handler attributes ignore the event's interface

[01:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: actually the spec is wrong, it says "Must be invoked whenever an abort event is targeted at or bubbles through the element or object." where "abort" is linked to a definition that states a specific interface

[01:28:01.0000] <zcorpan>
actually i'll just file a bug

[01:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It seems like <dialog> is more trouble than it's worth. We could say dialog is abbreviated <dl> instead.

[01:59:00.0000] <annevk>
it's interesting how Leif goes from not optimized for, to unfit, without explaining why

[02:03:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, if we want to use it for chat logs as well having a different container would help

[02:04:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, so you can allow other elements in it as well

[02:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: other elements between dt and dd aren't compatible with ie's parser

[02:10:00.0000] <annevk>
you'd have to require closing tags

[02:10:01.0000] <annevk>
oh, I guess I see what you mean

[02:10:02.0000] <annevk>
well, hopefully IE gets a better parser in due course

[02:12:00.0000] <BenMillard>
it seems people just use <p> and put the speaker name somewhere near the start on the web

[02:12:01.0000] <BenMillard>
so I guess that's all users need

[02:13:00.0000] <BenMillard>
some examples: http://projectcerbera.com/web/study/2008/dialogue

[02:13:01.0000] <BenMillard>
oh, some use <dl> instead

[02:14:00.0000] <BenMillard>
uses <dl>, then stops the <dl> and uses <h4> to change scene: http://greenmethods.com/site/weblog/2001/01/whos-ojectionable/

[02:15:00.0000] <BenMillard>
then starts a new <dl> after the <h4> scene change

[02:16:00.0000] <BenMillard>
there is no container around the dl+h4+dl sequence, so maybe stopping and starting <dl> works fine

[02:18:00.0000] <BenMillard>
<dl class="dialog"> with <p> and suchlike inside each <dd>: http://xhtml.com/en/web-standards/conversation-with-opera/

[02:22:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, the IRC demos now use #dfd as you suggested: http://projectcerbera.com/!dev/irc-logs/day-telecon

[02:22:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, I got the chance to test it on a range of TFTs and a couple of laptops. It's much more visible on them.

[02:23:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, I find it kinda funny that this huge, hot CRT from 2001 has better colouration than "high-tech" flat screens from 2008. :)

[02:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: maybe you have a pretty low contrast set?

[02:29:01.0000] <zcorpan>
er

[02:29:02.0000] <zcorpan>
low brightness

[02:31:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, the TFTs I tested were factory settings

[02:32:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, just played around with contrast setting on this CRT, still great colouration

[02:32:01.0000] <BenMillard>
TFTs always look grubby compared to this...and yes I did make sure they weren't covered in dust first :P

[02:33:00.0000] <BenMillard>
the laptops were LCDs and the most modern one was better than the TFTs but still not as good as this CRT

[02:33:01.0000] <BenMillard>
/me hugs his screen.

[02:34:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, brightness setting on this CRT is factory default. I see how lowering it makes brighter colours more distinct, though

[02:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
In general flat panel screens are known to have poorer colour reproduction than CRTs. Although it depends significantly on the panel tech. If you are prepared to pay say $1000 for a flat panel you can get one with good enough colour reproduction for professional print publication

[02:41:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, nice to know I'm not going mad, thanks. 8)

[02:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
Panels costing like 100 GBP use a technology that has good refresh rate (nice for games) but lousy colours

[02:42:00.0000] <takkaria>
apple displays also tend to have a wider colour gamut than most other TFTs

[02:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
See http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1039222 for example

[02:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, enlightening. :)

[02:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Hmm, my new 'grep' takes about one minutes for 130K pages, rather than >10 minutes for the old one)

[02:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I probably ought to multithread it so it's 4x faster, which would be nice)

[03:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Is it CPU limited?

[03:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Yes

[03:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: (It used to be disk limited, but now there's fewer files and they're compressed so it should all be cached in RAM)

[03:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Clearly the solution is to rewrite everything in Erlang

[03:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: What advantages would that have over simply adding a ThreadPoolExecutor and a few lines of glue and a synchronized output method? :-)

[03:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It would have more magic pixie dust.

[03:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: How much more magic pixie dust, as a percentage by mass?

[03:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Magic pixie dust has zero mass (and therefore is ruled out as a candidate for dark matter)

[03:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Gecko ranks kCharsetFromHintPrevDoc higher than kCharsetFromAutoDetection. 

[03:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Magic pixie dust couldn't be a candidate for dark matter anyway, because it glows

[03:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so shouldn't HTML5 have that, too, between chardet and the user-set default?

[04:15:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, never realized that lack of an overview of elements and attributes prevented people from reviewing the specification

[04:15:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe we should add them then

[04:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: there's an overview at http://simon.html5.org/html5-elements

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: It's not normative! :-)

[04:27:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: an overview in the spec wouldn't be normative, either

[04:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: indeed

[04:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: more seriously, though, I think your page should be publicized more widely

[04:28:01.0000] <zcorpan>
some people linked to it a few years ago

[04:29:00.0000] <karlcow>
http://twitter.com/karlpro/status/1158293590

[04:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
karlcow: thanks :)

[04:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, do you have a script that generates that list of elements?

[04:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: no :(

[04:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I could have used it since I think we need an index of elements and attributes for both the spec and authoring guide

[04:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
but I guess I will have to write my own one day

[04:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe hsivonen or Philip` have something that can be used to generate an index

[04:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I have the thingy that scrapes the spec for element-specific attributes

[04:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: should we have a dedicated exception for "too few arguments" or "wrong arguments" instead of NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR?

[04:45:00.0000] <annevk>
it should be fairly trivial to write a script since the element definitions are pretty consistent

[04:45:01.0000] <annevk>
though you might want special code for <input>

[04:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: there are gotchas like the body element appearing twice

[04:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'd need a script that scrapes from the authoring guide, which is structured differently from the spec

[04:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
and is undergoing a major restructuring right now

[04:47:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, that one doesn't carry the class

[04:47:01.0000] <annevk>
i.e. the conforming element definitions carry a class name which can be used to identify them

[04:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: oh. good to know. the observation would have saved me some trouble earlier

[04:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: where does the relative order of last visited charset and frequency analysis come from?

[04:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: as far as I can tell, Gecko seems to have them the other way round

[05:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is it intentional that charset inheritance for same-origin iframes isn't specced explicitly?

[05:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
karlcow: Wow, a Twitter message with a URL that's not using something like TinyURL

[05:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, what twitter message?

[05:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if anyone is archiving the URL-shortening services' databases, to avoid vast swathes of links all across the web suddenly disappearing when those services shut down

[05:04:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I doubt it

[05:04:03.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: The one karlcow wrote and linked to

[05:05:00.0000] <karlcow>
twitter, frienfeed thing is becoming insane, yes I had to click through 4 indirections before going to the page

[05:06:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems the class name is on the <dl> following the header, by the way

[05:06:01.0000] <annevk>
however, another difference seems to be is that the second body element header does not have <dfn>

[05:07:00.0000] <annevk>
the most annoying thing with twitter indirection is that when you click to expand and then click the link you still go to the fricking redirect service

[05:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: any data on the insertHTML execCommand?

[05:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Do you have a regexp for that?

[05:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: execCommand\s*\(\s*("|')insertHTML ...maybe?

[05:12:01.0000] <zcorpan>
though the inserthtml part should be case insensitive

[05:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: http://philip.html5.org/data/execCommand.txt

[05:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: interesting

[05:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lots of people using the http://evil.che.lu/2006/9/25/no-more-ie6-background-flicker hack, it seems

[05:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Maybe the more advanced uses of execCommand tend to be hidden in external scripts?)

[05:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: likely

[05:24:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, my extract script gets 96 elements

[05:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: sub/sup?

[05:25:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm yeah, and mine includes <applet> ;/

[05:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
Do you cope with h1-h6?

[05:25:02.0000] <annevk>
me? no

[05:26:00.0000] <annevk>
it's five lines of Python atm

[05:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: http://simon.html5.org/html5-elements seems to not cope with h1-h6 either

[05:27:00.0000] <annevk>
what are you implying?

[05:27:01.0000] <annevk>
oh, those elements

[05:27:02.0000] <annevk>
duh

[05:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
Yes :-)

[05:27:04.0000] <Philip`>
because they're not in the spec as individual elements

[05:27:05.0000] <Philip`>
so extraction scripts have to be careful to handle them properly

[05:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: oops.. i thought i had h1-h6

[05:28:01.0000] <annevk>
I suppose I can add special code for the case where it ends with "elements</h4>\n"

[05:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: That seems an unnecessary generalisation - just do the special case "The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements"

[05:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, except for sub and sup

[05:29:02.0000] <annevk>
right

[05:30:00.0000] <annevk>
i suppose i'll special case <div> as being the last valid element too

[05:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: fixed, thanks

[05:34:00.0000] <annevk>
ok, maybe h1-h6, sub and sup need to be special cased

[05:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
I've published a major restructured version of the authoring guide (temporarily omitting the element reference) http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/

[05:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
This includes a new Overview section describing what the content of each section will be

[05:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm considering renaming the guide too, since The Web Developer's Guide to HTML 5 is a little long.  Possibly something like HTML 5: The Web Developer Reference (or Guide), or HTML 5: Developer's Reference

[05:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
The former alternative is longer than the current name

[05:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
The latter seems confusing since "Developer" could mean UA developer rather than web-page developer

[05:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, yeah. This is hard.

[05:44:00.0000] <annevk>
HTML 5 for Authors

[05:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
I need the name to be short, easy to abbreviate (or short enough to not need abbreviation), and convey it's audience as HTML authors or web developers

[05:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: That seems confusing because Authors are people who write books, and this isn't for them

[05:44:03.0000] <hsivonen>
this was also a problem with naming mozilla newsgroups

[05:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
who "developers" are, that is

[05:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe "HTML 5 for Web Developers"

[05:46:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, Web Authors then...

[05:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
does anyone have any feedback about the overview I just wrote?  Does what it describes seem like a reasonable structure?

[05:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, gsnedders, ^^

[05:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I can't quite imagine someone who knows nothing about HTML reading through the Introduction and How To Read and Preface sections before reaching the introductory tutorial section that tells them how to write HTML, without them getting bored and giving up before then

[05:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, and the Abstract and Status and TOC)

[05:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
The Abstract, Status and TOC are required.  I'm considering droppin the How To Read section, but right now it's useful for trying to work out how the guide will be marked up.

[05:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
The Preface will probably merge with the introductory tutorial

[05:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
all this charset stuff balloons into a scary amount of code

[05:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
just imagine how simple this *could* have been

[05:56:00.0000] <karlcow>
Lachy: put the how to read section at the end of the document in an appendix and refers to it. aka someone might want to read it once but not necessary over and over again. Powah of hypertext

[05:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, do you mean if we had developed and standardised on UTF-8 and UTF-16, and never had CRLF from the very beginning?

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Since they're required, maybe this is an unsuitable format for an introductory tutorial - for people who don't know anything about HTML and want an introductory tutorial, it seems better for them to Google for "html tutorial" and look at http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp and immediately get an example and a "Try it yourself" link

[05:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: even if we'd had multiple encoding with exactly one simple in-file declaration mechanism

[05:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: but UTF-8-only would of course have been simpler

[05:57:03.0000] <karlcow>
hmmm maybe Philip` just found the appropriate title

[05:57:04.0000] <karlcow>
"HTML 5 Tutorial"

[05:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I mean: Gecko needs *16* different charset information source ranks!

[05:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I think for a non-normative authoring guide the scope section should vanish, the intended audience section should probably vanish, the preface doesn't seem very accurate

[05:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, I don't really want to call the whole thing a Tutorial because that's more like what Dan C is producing

[05:58:03.0000] <hsivonen>
(15 currently, I'm adding one for HTML5-conformance)

[05:58:04.0000] <Philip`>
If it had been UTF-8-only, early text-mode web browsers would probably have not bothered implementing that correctly and would just dump the bytes to the terminal, and everyone would write in iso-8859-1 and the plan would fall apart

[05:58:05.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, yeah, the preface is still a work in progress. But what specifically is inaccurate?

[05:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
Specifically I'm not clear that the second paragraph is accurate/useful

[06:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
The third paragraph is irrelevant

[06:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
(in that I don't think this document needs to justify its own existance so much)

[06:00:02.0000] <Lachy>
ah, it was somewhat relevant to the section it was originally in. Now with it being moved around so much, yeah, it has lost its relevance

[06:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: HTML5 Reference

[06:01:01.0000] <karlcow>
/me is always surprised how people are harsh in their comments. cf [09:05]  <jgraham> The third paragraph is irrelevant

[06:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
karlcow: Fair enough, I was trying to be brief

[06:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
But then had to expand anyway so there was no point

[06:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
maybe I should just merge the scope, audience and overview into a single, more cohesive section

[06:02:03.0000] <karlcow>
brief can include love ;)

[06:02:04.0000] <takkaria>
karlcow: harsh or terse?

[06:02:05.0000] <karlcow>
takkaria: harsh

[06:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, I like receiving harsh comments. It means people are actually thinking about what I'm doing and helping to ensure I don't produce crap

[06:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I think at this point it is more useful to focus on the content of the document than the ntroductory material. The introductory material can be written at the end and should just say what HTML is and something about what follows

[06:03:02.0000] <takkaria>
I'm certainly in the habit of being extremely terse when reviewing things, if it's harsh that's a side-effect

[06:03:03.0000] <karlcow>
Lachy: "I like receiving harsh comments" it has a name ;) the M part of SM

[06:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
karlcow: This isn't that sort of channel ;)

[06:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
what's SM?

[06:04:02.0000] <karlcow>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism

karlkow: You were't refferrring to the scientific plotting application SuperMongo

[06:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
?!

[06:05:02.0000] <karlcow>
A new world to explore for Lachy, I think we lost him for a while. To type also in google images ;) if you want more details

[06:05:03.0000] <Philip`>
Nor to Super Mario?

It'd be interesting to see Google's stats on how many people choose to turn SafeSearch off

[06:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
I turn it off

[06:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't like my porn searches being filtered ;-)

[06:08:03.0000] <jgraham>
Section 1.3.2.2.2 Void Elements, referencing "The XML well formedness requirement" doesn't make much sense since you haven't even explained that XHTML is an XML dialect or what XML is or anything (I think this is a reorganisation artefact)

[06:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[06:09:01.0000] <karlcow>
Lachy it is a good start for refactoring the document

[06:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
Trying to teach HTML and XHTML simultaneously sounds like it's just going to cause confusion

[06:09:03.0000] <jgraham>
In general it seems hard to deal with XHTML since most people who already understand the difference will think it obvious but most people who don't will skip the introduction

[06:10:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, my attribute script fails on <embed>

[06:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
Although I always think writing things that teach anything well is close to impossible so I don't have the best opinion

[06:11:00.0000] <annevk>
and I suppose I should keep a list of elements as well besides a dictionary so you can get them in spec order...

[06:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
1.3.2.2.1 Attributes - The concept of a boolean attribute and an expanded and minimised form has not been explained

[06:11:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Ordered dictionary!

[06:12:00.0000] <annevk>
how do i get one of those?

[06:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
Use JavaScript

[06:12:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/odict.html

[06:12:03.0000] <jgraham>
Or write your own

[06:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems far easier to use a list

[06:13:01.0000] <annevk>
/me finds http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0372/

[06:13:02.0000] <annevk>
/me agrees with Philip`

[06:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Well it depends really; if you have to maintain a list and a dict keeping them in sync is some effort

[06:14:01.0000] <annevk>
html5lib is actually cited in that pep

[06:14:02.0000] <annevk>
never knew we were so famous

[06:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: If you're only appending, it's not a problem

[06:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
particularly if you don't care about asymptotic performance, so you can write "d[k] = v; if k not in l: l.append(k)"

[06:15:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: If you're only appending it is pretty easy to write your own odict with that code in

[06:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's even easier to not write your own odict :-)

[06:16:01.0000] <karlcow>
hmmmm "dict -d html5 blockquote" could be handy

[06:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: All the subsections 10 1.3.2.2 seem out of place. You are talking about concepts like attributes before you have even defined what they are.

[06:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Which I guess is not a problem for most people assuming your internal audience statement is basically "people with preexisting knowledge of HTML"

[06:22:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me is trying to guess which document jgraham is talking about

[06:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, which copy of the document are you reading?  Are you reading a cached version?

[06:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Maybe. Paste the URL in case I am not looking at the right one

[06:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/

[06:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
OK, the subsections are of 2.1.2

[06:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
(I had the older version before)

[06:30:00.0000] <karlcow>
jgraham: it is the how to read

[06:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
ah, ok. I've moved the How To Read section to the end, as karlcow suggested now, and added an issue stating that it may be dropped

[06:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
in my local copy. Not checked in yet

[06:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, from v.nu: "Error: End of file seen and there were open elements." - That would be much more useful if it told me which element wasn't closed

[06:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: ok

[06:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: status of this document says HTML 5 is not under /TR/

[06:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, there's a weird bug with anolis where if a <section> element isn't properly closed, all the heading levels get messed up

[06:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
using the replaceHeadings plugin

[06:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
however, I must say that using <h1> for all headings in the source is proving extremely convenient for restructuring purposes

[06:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just wish there were a way to make TextMate recognise the section element, so it could be collapsed in source view like div can

[06:44:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
Lachy: i'm pretty sure you can edit textmate's html bundle

[06:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
raspberry-lemon, I probably can. I just need to figure out which file to edit

[06:45:01.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
you don't have to edit the file directly

[06:45:02.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Show Bundle Editor

[06:45:03.0000] <Lachy>
I renamed it to "HTML 5 Reference" with the subtitle "A Web Developer’s Guide to HTML 5"

[06:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Not using html5lib is lame :)

[06:47:00.0000] <annevk>
if html5lib didn't delay processing by sixteen seconds

[06:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use lxml's HTML parser

[06:49:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
Lachy: inside the HTML bundle there's an item called HTML with a little L icon next to it

[06:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: It's not like you need to update the list very often

[06:50:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
if you replace the contents with http://gist.github.com/54566 it should let you collapse sections

[06:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: The delay is a huge pain when updating the script during development, though

[06:50:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Fair enough

[06:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
raspberry-lemon, found it and fixed the folding support. I'll have to go through and add all the HTML5 elements later, once I figure out what the rest of the file does

[06:53:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
http://johnmuhl.com/notebook/textmate-html5-bundle looks like someone's on it already

[06:55:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, it was mostly due to what Philip` said

[06:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
A year ago, 9 pages (from 130K) had <!doctype html>

[06:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
A few days ago, 16 (from a different 130K) had <!doctype html>

[06:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
which doesn't seem like huge growth

[06:59:02.0000] <Lachy>
raspberry-lemon, nice.

[07:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.nimh.nih.gov/ is one

[07:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
from a year ago

[07:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: so xhtml is dying and html5 is rising?

[07:02:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, I like how that page also uses <head profile>

[07:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.haroldschogger.com/ also has a <!doctype html> if you look carefully

[07:03:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
<!--paste your source code between these comments -->

[07:04:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
there are still a loot of management type people who insist on xhtml no matter what

[07:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Yes, based on the incontrovertible evidence of a few dozen pages

[07:04:02.0000] <Philip`>
But:

[07:04:03.0000] <Philip`>
Number of pages with doctypes containing the string "xhtml" a year ago: 23231

[07:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Number of pages with doctypes containing the string "xhtml" a few days ago: 32078

[07:05:01.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
do you have the number of pages with no doctype at all?

[07:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
raspberry-lemon: Number of pages containing the substring "<!doctype" out of total number of pages processed:

[07:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
A year ago: 65085 / 124986 (52%)

[07:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
Some days ago: 73385 / 127208 (58%)

[07:08:03.0000] <wilhelm>
Interesting.

[07:08:04.0000] <Philip`>
though it's really dangerous to compare these numbers

[07:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
because the samples are not equally biased

[07:09:01.0000] <wilhelm>
Brian will do a recrawl with MAMA soon. Will be interesting to see what has changed.

[07:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
(They're both random samples from dmoz.org, but dmoz.org itself changes a lot, e.g. some sites add tens of thousands of their own pages which can distort the results)

[07:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
(so I should probably stop trying to compare the numbers, because the results will just be meaningless and misleading)

[07:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
((That's "tens of thousands of their own pages" added to the 4.5 million in dmoz.org, so it's only hundreds in my samples))

[07:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
for the very first example document, in the introductory tutorial, should I begin with the most basic <!DOCTYPE html><title>Foo</title><p>..., or should I include the <html>, <head> and <body>?

[07:13:01.0000] <wilhelm>
Yeah, cnn.com alone accounts for 5% of the pages on dmoz.

[07:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm. Perhaps I should do the latter so that it helps readers understand the structure more easily

[07:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
wilhelm: It doesn't now, and didn't a year ago

[07:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
wilhelm: but it did at some point a bit earlier than a year ago

[07:14:03.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: don't omit tags, that's a confusing feature you should go into after all else (if at all)

[07:14:04.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Everybody writes <html> and <head> and <body>, so it's just unnecessarily confusing to try to tell them that it's unnecessary

[07:15:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Our data dump is a bit old. (c:

[07:15:01.0000] <zcorpan>
at least judging from comments on sitepoint forums

[07:15:02.0000] <annevk>
tag omission is prolly best learned from the spec itself :)

[07:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, the guide will cover tag omission

[07:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: if you're serializing yes but not if you're writing markup - the rules for tag omission are not very understandable

[07:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
it will cover everything. The issue is just how and in what order things will be covered

[07:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
It particularly gets confusing if you tell people they can omit the tags, but if they want to use lang then they have to add some back in, and if they want a class then they have to too, etc

[07:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
and it only saves five lines of copied-and-pasted code, so it doesn't seem worthwhile

[07:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: having to not omit tags on which you want to use attributes seems not so confusing - it's more the rules when they can be omitted

[07:18:01.0000] <zcorpan>
(when having no attributes)

[07:19:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, indeed, it will ensure that a small elite can still show of at parties with validating pages that omit various tags of which the elements are required

[07:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: It's the idea that you can omit tags and they implicitly exist even though you can't see them in your code, and that adding the tags into your code won't change the page at all (but will let you add attributes), that seems confusing

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: since normally if you don't write something, it doesn't exist

[07:20:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: true

[07:20:02.0000] <jgraham>
<tbody>

[07:20:03.0000] <jgraham>
No one writes <tbody>, ever but it is always there

[07:20:04.0000] <jgraham>
Which is even more confusing

[07:20:05.0000] <Philip`>
The difference is that you can survive perfectly happily for many years without ever knowing a <tbody> is there

[07:20:06.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: if the tag omission feature is only intended for a small elite (us?) i'd rather see the feature dropped

[07:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
where you'll need to know about <html> and <body> etc as soon as you add lang or class or style

[07:21:01.0000] <annevk>
mu

[07:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/where/whereas/

[07:21:03.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Unless you ever write a script or certian CSS selectors that manipulate a table

[07:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
e.g. table#foo > td doesn't seem so implausible

[07:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Nobody uses child selectors

[07:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
And anyway that'd never match anything because you forgot the tr :-)

[07:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Presumably now IE supports child selectors, people will be more inclined to use them

[07:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
and if you're writing a script, you'll use the table.rows property

[07:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: why would you want to write table > td rather than table td ?

[07:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: You would? Learning element-specific interfaces always seems like a lot of effort when you can always use a generic interface to do the same thing

[07:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Realistically, because that's how you were thinking about it. Theoretically because it is faster

[07:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
Or because you have nested tables

[07:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Two thirds of pages with CSS don't even use descendant selectors

[07:25:03.0000] <annevk>
table > td is certainly faster, it doesn't match anything normally :)

[07:25:04.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: so they're unlikely to flock to even more complex selectors

[07:25:05.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: :-p

[07:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Where did you get that data from?

[07:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: http://triin.net/2006/06/12/CSS#figure-30

[07:26:02.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: "table td" is less to type and looks nicer, but i take your point about nested tables

[07:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what he was wondering when he first typed "/me wonders"

[07:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Just put a class on all your <td>s and then you don't have to worry about this selector mess at all

[07:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, I know, it was whether the CSS usage will have changed in the past 2 years or whether IE6 is still too influential

[07:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
(And I would assume very few people used nested tables that aren't CSSless layout tables)

[07:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be interesting to see how many of the non-trivial selectors are used for browser-targetting hacks rather than for anything sensible

[07:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess the most common child selector is html>body

[07:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway, the point is that a markup guide should mention tag inference because a) it is not really that hard to understand b) authors often unwittingly use it, specifically in the case of <tbody>

[07:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't disagree that it should be mentioned :-)

[07:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
and c) if it is not mentioned it will confuse people who have never heard of <tbody> in HTML 4 and think it is a new concept in HTML 5

[07:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
I just think it makes sense to promote (via the early text and the examples) a style which is closest to what people do today, e.g. always have html/head/body and never have tbody

[07:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
because that seems to work alright today

[07:33:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i think it's ok to be mentioned and even spell out the rules in a more understandable way than the spec (but possibly with less precision), but i wouldn't *start* with it

[07:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: That sounds sensible indeed.

[07:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yikes

[07:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
can anyone suggest a simple way to describe the meaning or purpose of a DOCTYPE, without going into details about standards mode?

[07:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lots of people use X-UA-Compatible

[07:35:03.0000] <Philip`>
237 pages

[07:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: "The <!DOCTYPE html> line tells the web browser that this is a modern web page, and stops it from emulating the bugs that are needed for compatibility with some old web pages" or something like that?

[07:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
(That's 237 pages with the X-UA-Compatible HTTP header)

[07:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Do you have a minimal test-case?

[07:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I will make one

[07:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Common values:

[07:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
    120 IE=7

[07:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
    114 IE=EmulateIE7

[07:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
      2 IE=EmulateIE8

[07:39:04.0000] <Philip`>
      1 X-UA-Compatible

[07:39:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: The algorithm used for headers is almost certainly correct per spec, and it is HTML 5 that is wrong. If the parsing is b0rked, that's somebody else's problem

[07:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Oi

[07:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: :)

[07:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, it could be the parsing. I will certainly blame jgraham for the bug

[07:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
644 pages use <meta blah x-ua-compatible>, though over half of those are IMDB and Myspace

[07:41:02.0000] <annevk>
:/

[07:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.hindustantimes.com/  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=7;FF=3;OtherUA=4" /> - oh dear

[07:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.it-production.com/   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" />

[07:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, maybe it's not a bug after all. I'm having difficulty reproducing it.  I may have simply miscounted the number of section element start and end tags

[07:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
if it happens again, I'll investigate more thoroughly

[07:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#getting-started-with-html-5

[07:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
413 pages send X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

[07:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
but only 59 if you exclude blogspot.com

[07:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
this is the first document that the tutorial will teach http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/examples/example01.html

[07:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: The meta charset is scary

[07:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
Also, tabs are ugly

[07:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
I know, but I'm not going to omit the charset declaration from any document. Authors need to learn to always include it

[07:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
well, any HTML document. Not XHTML documents.

[07:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
not sure what I'll do about polyglot documents though

[07:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why he has a weird black pixel in his PDF document, and then realises it's because he accidentally used \dot instead of \bullet

[07:56:01.0000] <zcorpan>
"This line is used to indicate that the document is an HTML 5 document" hmm

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That line (that zcorpan quoted) fails to give any justification to why authors should bother with typing that or why it's "good practice"

[07:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
and so a sensibly lazy author might decide to not bother with it

[07:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
I think it's important to say that if they don't have that line, their browser will be even weirder and buggier than it usually is

[08:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
so they're harming themselves if they don't use it

[08:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: The sentence two before that is wrong when applied to XHTML (which is fine if you are using HTML to mean text/html but it doesn't look like yiou are)

[08:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, and if they don't have the doctype then they won't be able to use any new HTML5 features in IE8

[08:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, what makes you think I'm not using HTML to refer only to HTML?

[08:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, that's an incomplete sentence. I need to say something about validators

[08:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
or perhaps find some other way to say what the doctype is for

[08:02:02.0000] <zcorpan>
not sure you need to say anything about validators

[08:02:03.0000] <Lachy>
I really wanted to avoid the standards vs. quirks mode issue in this section

[08:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: since standards vs. quirks is the reason we have a doctype at all, it seems not mentioning it when explaining what it's for is going to be misleading

[08:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: The fact that you use it to mean "HTML the abstract language" and "HTML the text/html serialisation of the abstract lanuage"

[08:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
You wouldn't need to explain the specific issues or the reason why it exists, but I think you need to state that it causes problems if you don't have it

[08:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/the reason/the historical reason/

[08:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
"The purpose of the DOCTYPE is to ensure that web browsers interpret the document using standards mode, rather than the mode intended for handling legacy content."

[08:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
is that ok?

[08:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: "What's standards mode?"

[08:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
see, this is why I didn't want to go into that yet!

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems easier to phrase it as a negative, i.e. saying that it makes the browser not implement old bugs

[08:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me agrees with Philip` 

[08:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me also agrees that it ought to be mentioned tehre

[08:16:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*there

[08:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
"For historical reasons, the purpose of the DOCTYPE is to ensure that web browsers do not interpret the document in a way intended for handling legacy content that exists on the web."

[08:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
The DOCTYPE is a holdover from the early days of the web. Using this doctype will ensure that web browsers do not try to replicate weird behaviour in older browsers that some content came to rely on

[08:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Are you going to ignore that IE8 won't support new features at all, if you don't use the doctype?

[08:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
(so it's not just to prevent weird behaviour; it's to allow modern behaviour)

[08:19:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The DOCTYPE is required so that browsers do not treat the document as they treat legacy, non-standards compliant, content.

[08:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That's just wrong

[08:19:03.0000] <wilhelm>
What's legacy content?:P

[08:19:04.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: because they'll treat perfectly standards-compliant HTML 3.2 content that way too

[08:19:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: How so?

[08:19:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: True.

[08:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wilhelm: deployed content

[08:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: And 4.01 Transitional

[08:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
wilhelm: True.

[08:25:00.0000] <wilhelm>
zcorpan: _I_ know what it means, but I don't think that part of our tribal language equally well understood elsewhere. jgraham's wording is better, I think.

[08:25:01.0000] <wilhelm>
+is

[08:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
"The DOCTYPE is a remnant from the early days of the web. For historical reasons, it is needed to ensure that web browsers interpret the document correctly, rather than using a special compatibility mode designed to replicate the behaviour of older browsers, which is intended for handling legacy content."

[08:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm still not sure what to replace "legacy content" with

[08:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
I used "legacy HTML content"

[08:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm sure the meaning of legacy is well understood, and so that should be clear enough

[08:32:00.0000] <svl>
/me would drop the entire "which is intended" subclause.

[08:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
why?

[08:32:02.0000] <svl>
Keep your sentences as short as possible.

[08:32:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[08:32:04.0000] <svl>
and at first glance I find it confusing what "which" applies to.

[10:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Trying to see where http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090129#l-588 came from: It looks like someone copied-and-pasted the "IE=8;FF=3;OtherUA=4" from http://www.alistapart.com/articles/beyonddoctype, then manually changed the 8 to a 7, leaving the rest unaltered, and then it spread around a handful of forum postings and web sites

[10:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
How can people be so unaware of what they're doing? Do they really think it's sane to have a version string that says any UA other than IE and Firefox should render as if it was version 4?

[10:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: If you have invalid / bad practise examples in your authoring guide, please including some mouse event scripts that make it impossible for anyone to copy-and-paste from those examples

/me wonders how much point there in applying to Opera — accommodation may well be horribly complex to arrange :\

[10:23:00.0000] <wilhelm>
For an internship?

[10:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah

[10:23:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(complex because I'm under the age of majority in most of Europe)

[10:26:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Opera has some apartments available for people staying for shorter periods of time. I'm not sure what the plans are for accomodation for summer interns, but it can't hurt to ask. (c:

[10:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
wilhelm: There may well still be the issue of age, meh.

[10:35:00.0000] <takkaria>
wilhelm: thanks for mentioning the internship thing, I have an interview next friday :)

[11:16:00.0000] <wilhelm>

[11:36:00.0000] <takkaria>
wilhelm: looks like Bibbi Svärd

[11:41:00.0000] <wilhelm>
Ah. At the Swedish office.

[11:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what to write as a covering letter

[11:45:00.0000] <takkaria>
why you're interested in working there, highlighting relevant experience from your CV, explaining why you do or don't fit the requirements laid out in the description, roughly

[11:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
You should put some clipart on it too

[11:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blatantly sucks at applying :)

[11:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
takkaria: Fun: I don't really have irrelevant experience on my CV :)

[11:49:00.0000] <takkaria>
well, you highlight the most relevant bits

[11:49:01.0000] <takkaria>
if it's all most relevant, choose some of it to highlight and highlight that

[11:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could make up some fake irrelevant experience, and then highlight the rest

[11:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
and because it's irrelevant nobody will ask you about it and so they'll never notice it's fake

[11:53:00.0000] <takkaria>

So first there are lots of complaints that specifying error handling endorses errors

[13:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Even though the nonconforming attributes and stuff are hidden so Roy Fielding can't find them

[13:40:00.0000] <karlcow>
former: social effects with regards to browsers in face of authoring, latter: specifications on what has changed or not in a language.

[13:40:01.0000] <karlcow>
Conflating two different issues. tsss tsss ;)

[13:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If people can't find the nonconfirming stuff in the spec, they can't be confused to believe it's conforming

[13:43:00.0000] <karlcow>
Dashiva: the question is not here.

[13:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: He found enough of the nonconforming stuff (in the description of error handling for that attribute) to think it was a conforming part of the language, and there isn't anything that states it's non-conforming

[14:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
I like how, so far, that everyone who's whinging about the name attribute being omitted is silently ignoring the arguments that it was XHTML 1.1 that dropped it first.

[14:10:00.0000] <slightlyoff>
Lachy: most of the web silently ignores XHTML 1.1, so they're just following suit ;-)

[14:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, re http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0586.html ...

[14:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
with the audience defined as "... individuals wishing to establish the correctness of documents with respect to the requirements it describes.", including DOM APIs doesn't seem necessary

[14:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
to me, that audience section suggests that it's of more use to HTML conformance checkers, for which the DOM APIs have no relevance.

[14:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
unless they're going to try and check the conformance of a script too, which is impossible

[14:26:00.0000] <roc>
what the Web really needs is aesthetic conformance requirements

[14:30:00.0000] <slightlyoff>
roc: I'd like to browse the web through such a filter sometimes...oh, wait, that's what adblock is for

[14:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
roc, that's easy. Just add myspace.com/* to your adblock and youll block a significant portion of asthetically displeasing pages

[14:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: There's a firefox extension for myspace

[14:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
that does what?

[14:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you block MySpace then you'll block a third of the RDFa namespaces I've seen on the web

[14:43:01.0000] <Philip`>

Lachy: Have you set up a filter to delete his mails?

[15:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
It looks like they're showing up in the archive, so I don't understand what's going on.  They're not in my junk folder either, although I suppose that's where they belong anyway

[15:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
no, I don't delete any mails except spam, and he doesn't quite qualify as spam

[15:13:00.0000] <Hixie>

>   This specification is intended for producers of documents

[15:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
>   intended to conform to the requirements it describes

[15:13:03.0000] <Lachy>
I know. I think the first part needs to be dropped

[15:13:04.0000] <Lachy>
or revised

[15:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i'm trying to avoid arguing about what i think the audience statement should be, and just review the draft based on what it is

[15:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
what it _should_ be is imho mostly up to the editor

[15:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I'll argue about the audience statement with Mike then, since it seems easier than getting him to drop the Relax NG schemas and regexs from the draft

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to work out what to do about the script execution model around page navigation

[15:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: there's really no way i can get you to trade the massive complexity of multiple personality Window objects for the performance hit of cross-document script calls checking that the target code is still active?

[15:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well - given that we have the split window solution already implemented, and that it was quite a bit of work to validate its security properties, I don't find the complexity reduction to be much incentive

[15:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: because we'll have to do a similar amount of work probably to make sure the new model works

[15:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so, given that it's also certain to be a significant performance hit, I'm not super enthusiastic about it

[15:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: Microsoft have teh opposite argument, so that one is pretty much a non-issue for me

[15:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: sure, I'm telling you why "massive complexity" does not count as a cost for the split Window solution

[15:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
(including the performance aspect, since i'm pretty sure multiple-window stuff has a perf hit elsewhere, e.g. page load)

[15:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[15:38:03.0000] <othermaciej>
also my understanding is that IE does something similar to split window, but I could be wrong

[15:38:04.0000] <othermaciej>
no, split window is not a hit to page load time

[15:38:05.0000] <Hixie>
not as far as i can tell

[15:38:06.0000] <othermaciej>
believe me we are very thorough about measuring these things

[15:38:07.0000] <Hixie>
they just turn off scripts

[15:38:08.0000] <othermaciej>
in fact it enabled us to implement some additional optimizations

[15:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
so is there any way i can get you to describe exactly what you do, in terms of the EcmaScript spec?

[15:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
IE has orders of magnitude slower JS than anyone else, so I think their input on the importance of the perf hit is not credible

[15:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I can try to describe it

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
(re perf - that's not a politically tenable position for me to hold, unfortunately)

[15:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
for the lifetime of any given frame, including a top-level frame, there is an "outer" Window object

[15:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
for any given Document, there is an "inner" Window object

[15:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
do either of these map to the global object?

[15:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there is a one-to-one correspondence between browsing contexts and outer Window, and between Documents and inner window

[15:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the inner window acts as the global object

[15:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
for purposes of the scope chain and in general providing the global scope

[15:41:04.0000] <othermaciej>
getting back to my narrative...

[15:41:05.0000] <othermaciej>
the outer window delegates all property and method access to the inner window

[15:41:06.0000] <Hixie>
/me lets you explain it before asking further questions :-)

[15:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
on navigation, the outer window's associated inner window is replaced with the one for the new current document

[15:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in the scope chain, you have the inner window

[15:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
when you access "this" in global scope, or access the global "window" property, or in any other way reify a reference to the global object, you get the outer window

[15:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
thus, any mechanism you use to get an actual object reference gives you a persistent one

[15:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but function scopes see their original defining global object in their scope chain

[15:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the inner window is the "true" global object, and the outer window is a persistent handle to whatever is the current global object for a given browsing context

[15:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the way this prevents exploits is that a function defined in a frame when the frame had a different document, but somehow persisted, sees the old global variables, not the new global variables

[15:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
unless it stored a reference to the outer window, but in that case, a security check applies

[15:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the kind of exploit this is trying to prevent is:

[15:44:03.0000] <othermaciej>
evil.com has a top-level document with a subframe, also on evil.com

[15:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the inner frame defines a function, and passes it to the outer frame

[15:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the attacker navigates the subframe to victim.com

[15:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
in a naiive implementation of persistent global objects, the saved function has access to the global variables and document of victim.com

[15:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but split window prevents that, because the saved function sees the old global variables

[15:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I will also note, this kind of design makes it much easier to implement a back-forward cache

[15:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it greatly simplified our page cache implementation

[15:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
(the spec prevents it by refusing to run the function)

[15:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
so as far as i can tell, what you describe violates the EcmaScript spec

[15:46:05.0000] <othermaciej>
right - refusing to run the function is not a practical option, because it would require a security check at every JS-to-JS call boundary

[15:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
specifically section 10.2.1, which says the scope chain and |this| are the same object.

[15:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
are you in the ecmascript meeting by any chance?

[15:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the one happening today? no

[15:47:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but I can raise this issue with the ECMAScript group

[15:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
k

[15:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
that would be good

[15:47:06.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure if the 'this' behavior is essential for compatibility

[15:47:07.0000] <Hixie>
since apparently i'm going to make HTML5 violate the spec

[15:47:08.0000] <othermaciej>
I know the fact that 'window' returns the outer reference is

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
which window is the one with the Math object on it? outer or inner?

[15:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
and do any calls to outer just forward to the current inner?

[15:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
inner is the one that really has a Math property - the outer forwards to the inner, so as far as anyone can observe, it also has a Math property pointing to the same object

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
does the outer object's prototype change dynamically? or does it just appear to have teh inner's prototype?

[15:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
now you found something that I actually need to look up :-)

[15:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[15:49:04.0000] <othermaciej>
or better yet ask weinig 

[15:49:05.0000] <othermaciej>
weinig: ayt?

[15:49:06.0000] <weinig>
yes

[15:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: i'm in the cafe btw

[15:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
weinig: how does the prototype of the outer window work, with respect to split window?

[15:50:02.0000] <weinig>
othermaciej: it should not be visible to the user

[15:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
weinig: does it change on navigation or is it just totally separate from the inner prototype?

[15:50:04.0000] <othermaciej>
weinig: ok

[15:50:05.0000] <weinig>
othermaciej: it should always reflect the prototype of the current inner window

[15:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so if you get the __proto__ property on the outer window, you get the current inner window's prototype?

[15:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
weinig: so  a = window.__proto__; navigate(); a !== window.__proto__  ?

[15:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i can spec this

[15:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've only rewritten this part of the spec about a dozen times so far

[15:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[15:52:03.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: that should be the case

[15:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
k

[15:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
this is going to make the object returned by window look mighty hoopy in idl

[15:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i'll do this later. time to find the js guys.

[15:55:01.0000] <Hixie>

It seems odd that no-one has responded on WSG to the question Steve asked about the language spec

[17:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what question was that?

[17:29:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: FWIW, AFAIK Gecko's scheme is exactly the same as what Maciej described

[17:31:00.0000] <olliej>
morning roc

[17:31:01.0000] <roc>
incorrect

[17:31:02.0000] <olliej>

[22:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, <video controls>...

[22:55:01.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe the UA should eat click events when clicking on controls?

[22:55:02.0000] <zcorpan>
making the element effectively not interactive -- i.e. clicking on the video itself could follow links

[22:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
although maybe we should wait for the captions stuff to be fleshed out

[23:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: is there a difference between "special semantics" and "special requirements"?

[23:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes, but that doesn't mean i used them correctly :-)

[23:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me checkes

[23:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think my point with <bdo> being different was that dir="" is actually required on <bdo>, hence it's a requirement

[23:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i'll change it

[23:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i'm fine either way i was just wondering about the destinction :)

[23:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
changed

[23:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
if you'll forgive me for making more comments on editorial stuff:  void click(); // shadows HTMLElement.click() uses <code> instead of <span>

[23:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i have a note on that somewhere

[23:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
arguably it's intentional, too :-)

[23:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but looks weird :)

[23:30:01.0000] <zcorpan>
especially since i have a user stylesheet for html5 that makes <code> smaller

[23:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[23:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's silly :-P

[23:31:02.0000] <zcorpan>
there's a silly opera bug that makes <code> be 16px instead of 13px if you specify font-size:inherit as you do

[23:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and i like 13px

[23:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: that's not a bug.

[23:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: why would you want the font size to not match surrounding text?

[00:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: because monospaced fonts looks larger than normal text

[00:00:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: browsers have a default of 16px for normal text and 13px for monospace for a reason

[00:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, i hate it and always set them both to 16px

[00:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
drives me batty that all monospace text is tiny compared to the rest

[00:01:01.0000] <zcorpan>
well i guess you're different than most :)

[00:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I also crank up mu monospace font size

[00:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
my

[00:08:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
the default is way too small

[00:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I still am very skeptical that it aligns with what typical users want

[00:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(i've changed font for monospace that looks bigger than curier new so it's way too big for my taste at 16px)

[00:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me adds html[lang="en-US-x-hixie"] .status { margin-left:-2px !important } to his user stylesheet and finds the result satisfying

[00:20:00.0000] <annevk>
/me agrees with Hixie on monospace font size

[00:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders what on earth .status matches

[00:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
is that the things on the side

[00:21:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: yeah

[00:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
are they overlapping something?

[00:21:04.0000] <zcorpan>
no but they are touching the text exactly, i'd like *some* space between

[00:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders how many e-mails his last checkin will produce

[00:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: semantics be damned.

[00:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh not that one

[00:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean the next one

[00:30:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, the note that suggests event handler attributes cannot be specified on the body element seems wrong, they can, but they do not listen to events dispatched at the body element

[00:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i have a comment about the checkin!

[00:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: s/PUBLIC/SYSTEM/

[00:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: no, those even handler attributes can't

[00:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: thanks

[00:34:00.0000] <annevk>
why not? <body onload="">... works

[00:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's not the event handler attribute for <body> though

[00:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's the Window one

[00:35:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, but it is specified on <body>

[00:37:00.0000] <annevk>
/me reads minutes of yesterday's call

[00:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure, but the ones that are listed are the _element_ event handler attributes

[00:37:02.0000] <annevk>
o_O

[00:39:00.0000] <annevk>
"<masinter> new features shouldn't be added until they are agreed"

[00:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: did you consider about:blank?

[00:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[00:41:02.0000] <zcorpan>
do you consider it more misleading than about:legacy-compat?

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
about:blank has all kinds of baggage already

[00:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so? :)

[00:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
(i'm not arguing for it i'm just wondering why you rejected it)

[00:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
i've learnt to avoid dragging in baggage in the interests of not creating new things

[00:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
it almost always ends of being more complicated later

[00:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>

"As usual, Boris, you're unable to listen to what others are saying." RB is such a nice fellow

[01:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: when somebody complains about communication with Boris, you do have to wonder where the communication problem really is

[01:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wonders whether it's worthwhile to point out on the list that there's http://simon.html5.org/sandbox/bookmarklets/reveal-comments available

[01:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
given that Boris conducts himself in discussions with quite a bit of genuine tact

[01:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
when i find myself communicating with RB, i ususally stop digging

[01:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'd think most people would judge Boris to be a pretty good example of how to conduct onself in standards discussions

[01:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
me, on the other hand...

[01:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wonder if I might be the person in the group hated by the broadest range of participants

[01:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and not just hated by one particular set of partisans

[01:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe we should have a poll: Who do you hate the most? Who's the biggest problem in the group?

[01:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
with a binding resolution that whoever wins, he gets voted off the island

[01:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: I thought Mr Last Week already did that

[01:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
At least I see Ben Millard around a lot less these days

[01:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes that he has nothing against Ben and in fact came second in that "poll" himself

[01:47:02.0000] <annevk>

[01:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

[01:48:01.0000] <annevk>
/me still has to see part two

[01:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: yeah, I saw that poll. I don't really understand why MLW is taking shots at you and Ben

[01:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: or actually, why I wasn't included

[01:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
perhaps MLW considers me an interloper here

[01:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: I think you are not percieved as one of Hixie's groupies. Whereas I follow him around on all his world tours.

[01:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[01:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think of myself as a Hixie groupie

[01:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least if Hixie had a fan club, I would join

[01:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
especially if group membership came with stickers I could put on my lunchbox

[01:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
You get a free copy of "Hixie sings the Blues"

[01:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
(not avaliable in shops)

[01:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess some migh consider me a more of a Judas among the disciples, rather than a Luke the Beloved Physician

[01:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: and you and annevk would be the Boanerges

[01:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, there are some who believe that it wasn't Jesus that died on the cross, but actually Judas

[02:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: surely the Bible can't be wrong

[02:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: if you think it's wrong, the solution is to fork it with changes to the parts you don't agree with

[02:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's what some big religions have done

[02:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
like the part of the bible that originally said, "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God"

[02:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
some "bibles" change that to not say "the Word was God"

[02:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh i might just do that. though i'm not sure what impact it would have with my relationship with my gf. considering that there have been wars over religion it's perhaps not the best thing to do after all

[02:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, is one of you theistic and the other atheist?

[02:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
I assume you'd be the atheist, if that's the case

[02:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i'd rather say i'm agnostic

[02:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, good enough

[02:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Harsh

[02:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
harsh?

[02:12:00.0000] <annevk>
"good enough"

[02:12:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: btw, why do you assume i'm not theistic?

[02:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I suppose you could just have meant your guess was good enough, but it sounded like you were implying that being religious as not good enough

[02:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, cause you seem smart enough to not be

[02:13:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: are you implying that my gf is not smart?

[02:13:03.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know you're gf.

[02:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Which I wouldn't say in public, because it is probably doesn't help anyone

[02:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
(and I say this as a pretty hardcore atheist)

[02:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I think I've made it quite clear in the past that I have no respect for religion and I have no problem with insulting it publicly

[02:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I have no problem with discussing it publically but insulting things that people really believe in, even if you think that belief is woefully misguided, is almost never a good strategy

[02:17:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: afaict whether one ends up being theistic has more to do with one's parents' religious view than one's smartness

[02:17:02.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Statistically that is true

[02:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, that's the BS argument that confuses respecting people's right to believe whatever they want with respecting what they believe

[02:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: No it's not. I don't respect what a lot of people believe. I also don't think telling them that they're an idiot because they believe it is a good way to get them to change their minds

[02:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, in most cases yeah, but in general, people who tend to think more logically and/or scientifically about things, tend to move away from religion

[02:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
I didn't say anyone was an idiot!

[02:25:00.0000] <annevk>
/me can't wait for lastweekinhtml5 to exploit that one o_O

[02:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I hope Lachy understands there's a difference between not having any respect for religion and not having any respect for people who have strong religious beliefs.

ooh the first time i'm mentioned

[02:30:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i wondered what it would take

[02:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: If you like the fame I can make pretend aspersions against your gf's character just to get you publicity ;)

[02:32:01.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: no thanks

[02:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
Ah well, making up things could have been so much fun. Nevermind :)

[02:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
you can make up things about me, though, if you find it amusing

[02:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
No, I guess it's much easier to make up things about myself. Less chance of actually offending anyone :)

[02:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me hardly ever takes offence even when offence is intended

[02:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
to clarify my previous statment, there's a difference between guessing someone's religious views based on their intelligence, and guessing someone's intelligence based on religious views. I did the former, not the latter

[03:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, i wonder whether <input type=color value=...> should use the parsing rules in http://simon.html5.org/specs/html-color-attributes or not

[03:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, no, probably not

[03:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
because that would effectively mean normalising the value before submitting, which shouldn't be done

[03:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the spec already does that

[03:06:01.0000] <zcorpan>
"The value sanitization algorithm is as follows: If the value of the element is a valid simple color, then set it to the value of the element converted to lowercase; otherwise, set it to the string "#000000"."

[03:12:00.0000] <annevk>
would make authoring tools more complex

[03:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
you mean there would be authoring tools needing the parsing algorithm for <input type=color> but not other colors?

[03:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the spec only uses the parsing rules for this requirement: "the user agent should allow the user to change the color ..."

[03:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
which wouldn't apply to an authoring tool afaict

[03:16:00.0000] <annevk>
when importing a document and representing the current color value an authoring tool would need to parse it

[03:16:01.0000] <annevk>
afaict this is the only place where you can validly put a color value

[03:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
*shrug*

[03:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i would expect such an authoring tool would like to parse legacy color values too to be useful

[03:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, how do you think I should resolve this issue about the term "node's subtree"? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2009JanMar/0256.html

[03:34:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I'm currently without funding for continuing the work I did during 2008 and 2007, so there's little I can contribute for now.

[03:35:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, I like how Last Week characterises me as a "Smithers"; he's cool.

[03:35:01.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: who, mr. Last Week or Smithers?

[03:36:00.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, Smithers :)

[03:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: i use "context node" pretty much the same way in http://simon.html5.org/specs/web-dom-core

[03:36:02.0000] <BenMillard>
but actually I think Last Week is cool too

[03:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, yeah, I'm not changing the term context node

[03:37:01.0000] <BenMillard>
Smithers is the only normal yet interesting character in The Simpsons, imho

[03:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
I tried looking up how xpath used the term and what made it so incompatible with the way I'm using it, but the xpath spec isn't really clear about it

[03:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
as far as I can tell, the definitions are, at least conceptually, relatively compatible with each other

[03:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't see the problem even if they were in conflict

[03:40:01.0000] <zcorpan>
it's a different spec

[03:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
yep

[03:46:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, when "Display all headings" is ticked in Table Inspector output, removing margins from the header information within each cell makes the output significantly more compact vertically.

[03:47:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, amounts to adding this: .__tableparser_heading_title {margin: 0;} .__tableparser_heading_list {margin: 0;}

[03:49:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, removing this fixes a "horizontal scrollbar to nowhere" in Firefox 2: h1 { width:100%; }

[03:50:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, oh and the -1 from the end of the margin property

[03:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
BenMillard: who cares about firefox 2? :P

[03:52:01.0000] <BenMillard>
zcorpan, jgraham will if he cares about me. :)

[03:53:00.0000] <BenMillard>
jgraham, this makes header information within the active cell red so can be told apart from the green highlight: .__tableparser_active_cell .__tableparser_heading_container {background-color: #fcc;}

[04:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think the least disruptive change I can make to address the selectors-api issue is changing "node's subtree" to "node's subtrees"

[04:17:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, how is it done for getElementsByClassName?

[04:18:00.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, seems to me that API would have the same issue, unless I'm missing something

[04:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
if you only use the term once or twice you can probably use the expansion in place of the term - i did that initially for web dom core but there are quite some places where i use it so it got a bit verbose

[04:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me might be thinking about something else than what annevk is discussing

[04:25:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought there was a problem with "subtree"

[04:25:01.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/selfDescribingDocuments-3023.html#standards seems like an argument against XHTML...

[04:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, getElementsByClassName() does it by saying "... excluding any elements that are not descendants of the HTMLElement  object on which the method was invoked." http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dom-getelementsbyclassname

[04:27:00.0000] <annevk>
I think I had that too originally

[04:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
but I'd rather not make such major changes to the normative prose at this stage. That risks introducing errors

[04:28:00.0000] <annevk>
the previous published draft still had wording to that effect

[04:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: you mean xhtml is not a widely deployed standard/format?

[04:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
which one? The Nov 14 draft similar to the editor's draft

[04:30:02.0000] <annevk>
though you seem to define subtree already so I'm not sure what the issue is

[04:30:03.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, right, i.e. IE doesn't do it

[04:30:04.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, the previous one

[04:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, yeah. I changed that because there were some issues with it and wanted to make it simpler.  I can't remember what exactly the problems were though.

[04:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me looks at appendix a of the tag finding

[04:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notes that html5's appendices aren't marked as A, B, etc

[04:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: maybe you should generate that if there's a class="appendix" or something?

[04:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
HTML5 doesn't have appendices

[04:35:01.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, it seems you now just moved parts to a definition so whether it's simpler depends on how many levels of indirection you like

[04:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: "There are also a couple of appendices, defining rendering rules for Web browsers and listing areas that are out of scope for this specification."

[04:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I didn't realise they were considered appendices

[04:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
actually they're numbered as normal sections, but Index, References and Acknowledgements aren't

[04:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
which are clearly appendices

[04:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
indirection is good in this case because the terms used are relatively easy to understand without looking at the explicit definitions

[04:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
and it also avoids too much repetition

[04:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wonders whether a validator should complain if <meta http-equiv=content-language> and <html lang> don't match

[04:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
it depends if they're slightly distinct meaning is preserved, or whether they mean the same thing now

[04:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/they're/their/

[04:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
Content-Language is non-conforming in HTML5 anyway

[04:54:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: still, if they don't match, chances are one of them is wrong

[04:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose it could be a useful warning to provide in addition to complaining about the use of content-language

[04:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
content-language sets the "document-wide default language" while <html lang> sets "the primary language for the element's contents and for any of the element's attributes that contain text"

[05:45:00.0000] <annevk>
http://lastweekinhtml5.blogspot.com/2009/01/mission-accomplished.html is he saying we became too soft? :) 

[06:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, now with his mission accomplished, does that mean he's done with his trolling?

[06:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
"Good Luck With That"

[06:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"maciejellian" wasn't so bad

[06:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The mission accomplished might also mean "It will soon dawn on me that firing back was easy, but bringing lasting change will take decades"

[06:35:00.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2009Jan/0143.html is interesting

[06:36:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, ^^ you might like it

[06:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: do you mean because V.nu fails to start if iana.org is unreachable? or because I don't subscribe to "follow your nose"? other reason?

[06:39:00.0000] <annevk>
"follow your nose" mostly and on a broader level it seems an argument against RDF and using URLs as identifiers

[06:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: yeah, Larry's opinion goes pretty starkly against the established stance of the TAG

[06:59:00.0000] <annevk>
all the respect for the i18n crowd, but recommending Unicode case-insensitive matching for effectively program identifiers and now Unicode Normalization does not do them credit, imo

[07:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me wonders whether i18n people have made comments on ecma262

[07:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notes that ecma262 says in various places that it expects javascript source to have been normalized to nfc before reaching the interpreter

[07:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me has never understood if or how that happens

[07:03:00.0000] <annevk>
should be easy to test, ECMA allows variables with Unicode characters in them

[07:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: is it possible to mark only the attribute instead of the whole tag when there's a message about an attribute in v.nu?

[07:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: not with the current infrastructure

[07:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: are you only keeping track of the locations of each parse event?

[07:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: yes

[07:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: couldn't you ad-hoc reparse the tag in the extract to find the attribute again?

[07:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but maybe it's too ugly a solution and more trouble than it's worth :)

[07:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.whitehouse.gov/copyright/ has rdfa

[07:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
<a rel="cc:attributionURL" property="cc:attributionName" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Whitehouse.gov</a>

[07:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
It also has <meta keywords=""> with a long list os misspellings of Barack Obama

[08:03:00.0000] <jcranmer>
including Barack Osama?

[08:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
Sadly, no

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
It also has <link href="file:///C:\Temp\msohtml1\11\clip_filelist.xml" rel="File-List" /> in a content-free Word document pasted into the middle

[08:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me just realized that tip #1 in http://blog.whatwg.org/styling-ie-noscript applies to firefox 2 as well

[08:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How will Roy find his name attribute if we split out everything about conforming documents to a new text?

[08:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: He seems to think it should be conforming

[08:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Replace it with some other attribute or element that's obsoleted yet supported then

[08:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
On a different but related note, the discussion about whether h:tml should discuss the conformance properties of URIs seems like exactly the sort of hole that is likely to open up if we split tightly intertwingled things into seperate specs

[08:46:00.0000] <karlcow>
Dashiva: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/index/elements.html  D O 

[08:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Presumably Roy believes that all the things he wants to know about should be conforming and everything else should be swept away under the rug

[08:46:02.0000] <karlcow>
/me has to go

[09:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`, you have to do something about your namesake

[09:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
If he's suggesting that because the WHATWG is a source of feedback that may result in creation of new drafts/sections and the feedback may not be seen by all the members of the WG and the editors might not say the feedback came from there, therefore it must be shut down ...

[09:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
he should probably also suggest that the W3C Team be shut down for the same reasons

[09:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
as well as the rest of the web

[09:33:03.0000] <Philip`>
and also all forms of non-computer communication

[09:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
A better suggestion is to not shut down any of those things, but just to make sure editors notify the group about where feedback came from if it wasn't directly from the group and resulted in new drafts/sections

[09:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. I guess replying would be pointless if he doesn't see that my point wasn't about venue but about the inspectability of feedback

[09:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: You did say "... feedback the whole group isn't seeing", and feedback anywhere other than public-html is going to not be seen by the whole WG; did you mean something more like "... feedback the whole group isn't able to see (even if they expend a bit of effort and visit some other web sites and mailing lists)"?

[09:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: good point

[09:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me suggests that very few people in "the group" see all the feedback on public-html either due to the volume

[09:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
Or simply due to the fact that many of the subscribed people aren't that interested

[10:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I wouldn't have bothered replying. The other Philip has been complaining about the existence of the WHATWG for a while and it seems quite typical of him to bring it up on seemingly unrelated topics

[10:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
besides, the way I interpreted your message was that even if the proposal was based on a WHATWG suggestion, or even any other public forum, it would still be nice to disclose that to the HTMLWG when submitting the proposal

[11:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow apache actually finally removed the content type

[11:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Now we just need to wait infinitely long until all deployed servers are upgraded

[11:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, do you mean it no longer sends a Content-Type header for unknown files?

[11:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
as of which version?

[11:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And how many linux distros will override it? :)

[11:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
sicking, re http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0661.html - the decision process isn't as bad as Rob's trolling makes it sound.

[11:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
sicking, it's just that people who often fail to make persuasive arguments tend misdirect their anger towards Hixie, rather than actually listening and doing something to strengthen their position

[12:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
the header of this page is longer than many of my actual pages http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/58958/notices/712181/recent=10;category=corp-insolvency-general;subcategory=moratorium-force 

[12:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I decided to try out Habari as a replacement for WordPress, but it doesn't look like it's going to meet my needs

[12:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think my options are back down to writing a custom made CMS

[12:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: It doesn't seem an entirely fair comparison, since your pages don't attempt to provide the same data

[12:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: What "needs"?

[12:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
better control over the URL structure

[12:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ah

[12:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, it really doesn't have that

[12:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
if there are plugins for that, then that would be good

[12:22:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sez ask in #habari

[12:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
In terms of use cases for RDFa, has anyone pointed at something like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping and said RDFa makes it much easier for consumers (in the cases where producers are cooperating by marking up the data appropriately)?

[12:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, how much do you know about habari?

[12:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: A fair bit

[12:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Still, #habari is a better chance than here :)

[12:24:04.0000] <Lachy>
on freenode?

[12:24:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: yeah

[12:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just don't want to start asking n00b questions in a developer channel

[12:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: It is the support channel too

[12:25:02.0000] <Lachy>
ah, ok

[12:34:00.0000] <weinig|food>
Hixie: do you have a second to give me your take on https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23651

[12:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
weinig: what do you want me to comment on?

[12:42:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: sorry, is a single retry a failure?

[12:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
weinig: if it's loaded from cache, on the reference hardware, then yes

[12:42:02.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: ok

[12:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
test 69 really shouldn't ever need to skip though, if it's loading from cache

[12:50:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: it is not clear to me why it is expected that relative speed of loading those 7 documents should be faster than running the javascript to get to test 69

[13:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
weinig: they should load in zero time :-)

[13:07:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: caching is not magical

[13:07:01.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: it still might have to hit the disk

[14:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
weinig: javascript isn't magical either :-)

[14:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
weinig: is the js really running faster than the disk can?

[14:07:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: it seems in some cases that may be happening

[14:08:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: but it looks like another issue was the reporter was doing a cached load in such a way that forced the resource to revalidated and reload

[14:08:01.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: if you don't use the reload button to do the cached load, the problem never happens

[14:09:00.0000] <weinig>
Hixie: though in general, I am not sure why cache behavior should even be a factor in acid3

[14:31:00.0000] <takkaria>
hm, mnot seems to be missing the point on the Origin header

[14:32:00.0000] <takkaria>
I'm pretty sure adam has said "referer can not be used to protect against CSRF attacks, and here's why" about five times now

[14:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
wtf? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0668.html - Does it not seem a little hypocritical to be complaining so vehemently about a very minor semantic issue with <a>, and then suggest a workaround blatenly using the <ins> element for a semantically dubious purpose?

[14:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
... for the sole purpose of attaining HTML4 validity?

[14:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
I can't quite figure out what's more important to these people. Semantic purity or strict adherence to a validator

[15:34:00.0000] <hober>
Sometimes I think what's more important to them is to hold some or any contrary position, whatever it may be...

[15:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
i encourage y'all to not imply there is a "them" or "these people"


2009-01-31
[16:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"This collection of indepedent individuals not acting with any common agenda"

[16:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, I can't believe I just read a message from Rob in which he agreed with Hixie quite a few times, and actually made some reasonable arguments where he didn't in some cases. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0675.html

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: my problem is not the wording, it's the implication that there is any specific collection of people who have common characteristics of being uncooperative

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
which i don't think is true, and which i particular don't think is productive

[16:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
it seems to be common for people to forget about the HTML4 diff document we already have

[16:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder why?

[16:23:00.0000] <takkaria>
tbh I have trouble keeping track of the different documents and mailing lists and I pay fairly good attention

Lachy: Probably because it's not normative and therefore nobody even remembers it exists

[16:24:00.0000] <Lachy>

Hey, I started redesiging the element summary boxes for use in the authoring guide. http://lachy.id.au/temp/template.html

[17:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
let me know what you think, and any suggestions for improvement

[18:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
note that the relevant items will be links once included in the main document and the spec gen does it for me

[18:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm going to bed now, leave feedback if you've got it
