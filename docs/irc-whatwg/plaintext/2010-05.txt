[17:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I don't think XBL is at all essential to styling <progress> or <meter>

[17:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: pseudo-elements should cut it

[17:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
certainly for <progress> and also for many common uses of <meter>

[17:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, pseudo-elements can handle simple styling. But if you want more advanced styles, like what canvas or svg can provide, then XBL is better

[17:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
CSS with pseudos can basically handle colours, backgrounds, borders and sizes. I would consider much beyond that to be more advanced styles.

[17:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder how CSS transitions would interact with <progress> and <meter> psuedo-elements, if you could use them to specify how to transition between state changes.

[17:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i replied to julian

[17:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
woot, i reached zero unread e-mails for the first time since monday!

[17:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
so, where was i wish timed tracks

[17:27:00.0000] <theMadness>
Lachy, progress and meter *pseudo* elements?

[17:28:00.0000] <tabatkins>
theMadness: Pseudos within the progress/meter.

[17:28:01.0000] <tabatkins>
So like progress::complete or something.

[17:28:02.0000] <theMadness>
Got it.

[17:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
theMadness, to be clear, pseudo-element selectors for use in CSS

[17:29:01.0000] <theMadness>
Somthing a la meter::stepping allowing us to determine how to transition between states might do it.

[17:29:02.0000] <theMadness>
Something a la meter::stepping allowing us to determine how to transition between states might actually prove quite useful.

[17:32:00.0000] <theMadness>
Actually I said meter but I was thinking progress.

[17:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
theMadness, would probably be done more like progress::complete { transition: width 1s linear; }

[17:33:00.0000] <theMadness>
I'm not arguing the syntax, I'll let you experts fight it out. :) But all in all it can (could) be very useful.

[17:34:00.0000] <tabatkins>
And with a "width: calc( attr(value,number) / attr(max,number) * 100% )" rule or similar.

[17:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
tabatkins, I assume the width would be handled by the UA stylesheet

[17:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
or other mechanism.

[17:35:02.0000] <tabatkins>
Well, yeah.  But if it's in CSS, it would be with a rule like that in the UA stylesheet.

[17:35:03.0000] <tabatkins>
Or else magic, yeah.

[17:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
Doesn't make much sense to allow authors to overriide that with CSS themselves, cause then they could use that to represent different states, rather than changing the element's attributes

[17:36:01.0000] <theMadness>
Yet we should be allowed to mess with it, isn't that the purpose of the whole thing? Like having a meter that fills using a background image positioning, or an opacity thing...

[17:36:02.0000] <tabatkins>
They can do that with the XBL bindings to canvas.  You won't really be stopping anything.

[17:36:03.0000] <theMadness>
Or font size...

[17:37:00.0000] <tabatkins>
And nod, there are decent cases for using more than a changing width to represent completion.

[17:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
if it's being represented as a bar, as it would by default, then I can't see anything but the width being used.

[17:38:01.0000] <tabatkins>
Vertical bar is the simplest counter-example.

[17:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
If it were altered to be a circular gauge, like a pressure gauge with a needle, then it would obviously not use width either. But that's something to be handled with SVG/canvas/XBL

[17:39:01.0000] <tabatkins>
Pfft.  You can totally do that with transforms.

[17:40:00.0000] <theMadness>
But it would lose all the semantic weight.

[17:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
meter and progress should probably inherit the same magic as <input type=range> for switching between horizontal and vertical bars

[17:40:02.0000] <tabatkins>
theMadness: No, doing the rendering with canvas/svg/etc doesn't harm the meaning of the <progress> itself.

[17:40:03.0000] <theMadness>
Uhm, what would the syntax edn up being?

[17:41:00.0000] <theMadness>
*end

[17:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
theMadness, the semantics would be on the <meter> element in the HTML markup. XBL is a technology that allows you do bind a template to an element, like meter, which can then have the appearance of replacing it with something more customised

[17:42:00.0000] <tabatkins>
With <canvas>, you can put <progress> as a child.  Or you can use XBL to bind an entirely different CSS tree to it.

[17:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
XBL isn't implemented by any browser yet though, it has been planned for a long time

[17:42:02.0000] <sicking>
Lachy, i'm working on it ;)

[17:42:03.0000] <Lachy>
hurry up!

[17:42:04.0000] <sicking>
that's actually almost true today

[17:42:05.0000] <sicking>
i'll be working on it next week in fact

[17:42:06.0000] <sicking>
/me is excited

[17:42:07.0000] <tabatkins>
Yay!

[17:43:00.0000] <theMadness>
sicking which UA?

[17:43:01.0000] <tabatkins>
ff

[17:43:02.0000] <sicking>
theMadness: Firefox

[17:43:03.0000] <sicking>
/me works for mozilla

[17:43:04.0000] <theMadness>
Nice.

[17:43:05.0000] <Lachy>
sicking, when do you expect to have experimental build available?

[17:43:06.0000] <theMadness>
As a gesture of goodwill I shall scold tabatkins for using the wrong abbreviation. It's FX, foo!

[17:44:00.0000] <tabatkins>
Correctness is democratic.  ff has been the right abbreviation for a long time, according to the people.

[17:44:01.0000] <theMadness>
Yeah but I'm trying to score points here. :)

[17:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
man i just can't get over how many fricking subtitle formats there are

[17:46:00.0000] <theMadness>
And how none of them is smil.

[17:46:01.0000] <tabatkins>
I'm honestly surprised too, considering that every new format needs someone to support it.  I'm guessing there are a lot of formats only accepted by a single consumer.

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
these formats are so similar that there's some tools that just have text files that define how to parse a lot of them

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
q.v. http://subtitleproc.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/subtitleproc/SubtitleProcessor/data/

[17:49:00.0000] <tabatkins>
Yay I get to buy a bike tomorrow morning!  Woo!

[17:49:01.0000] <tabatkins>
/me is excited about bikes.

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me recommends a hybrid with hardcase tires

[17:50:01.0000] <tabatkins>
I'm getting hardcase tires.  Hybrid?

[17:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
kind of a cross between a road bike and a mountain bike

[17:51:00.0000] <tabatkins>
Why would I need more than just a road bike?  I really don't intend to go biking in non-urban environments.

[17:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
mountain view is a non-urban environment

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
in terms of what bikes expect

[17:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
you got pot holes, glass on the floor, tree roots, all kinds of crap

[17:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
hybrids are often also termed "commutter bikes"

[17:53:03.0000] <tabatkins>
Well, the one I've got my eyes on is a narrow wheel, though not the blade-looking wheels you say on racing bikes.

[17:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
(though possibly spelt correctly)

[17:54:01.0000] <tabatkins>
s/say/see/

[17:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah hybrids are narower than mountain bikes and wider than racing bikes

[17:55:00.0000] <tabatkins>
All right, then that's what I'm getting.  ^_^  When I talked to the salesman guy, I specifically noted that I'll be using it for commuting.

[17:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://bicycling.about.com/od/howtoride/a/hybrids.htm

[17:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
one difference is the handlebars on a hybrid are like those on a mountain bike, straight, rather than the rounded ones of road bikes

[17:56:01.0000] <tabatkins>
Yeah, that's definitely what I'm getting.

[17:56:02.0000] <tabatkins>
Basically it just looks like a mountain bike with narrow wheels.

[17:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
excellent

[17:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[17:57:02.0000] <tabatkins>
Walt's Cycles was a good recommendation, btw.

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool, glad i could help

[18:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh my, I've just found a format that makes TTML look positively simple in comparison

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://guliverkli2.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/guliverkli2/src/subtitles/libssf/demo/demo.ssf

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
so far i think i can categorise most subtitle formats into one of four categories

[18:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
1. too trivial to be useful

[18:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
2. simple

[18:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
3. far too complicated

[18:21:04.0000] <boogyman>
what's the purpose of ttml?

[18:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
4. ludicrously complicated

[18:21:06.0000] <Hixie>
most fall into either #1 or #2

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
ssf is the only one in #4 so far

[18:22:01.0000] <tabatkins>
Oh, wow, that is definitely a #4.

[18:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: subtitles

[18:25:00.0000] <tabatkins>
Also, thumbs up on the engineer headphones.

[18:26:00.0000] <tabatkins>
I've gotten far too used to my decade-old gameboy earphones.

[19:02:00.0000] <lazni>
has anyone tested the html5 doctype on obscure mobile phones?

[19:04:00.0000] <boblet>
lazni: I will be later this month (Japanese phones), but haven’t yet

[19:04:01.0000] <lazni>
boblet: TIA, I'm just making sure it's compatible there

[19:05:00.0000] <boblet>
given how crap their browsers generally are (cHTML), and how rapid the turnover is, and how iPhone really shook things up over here, I’m not too worried about it though

[19:05:01.0000] <lazni>
'k

[19:05:02.0000] <lazni>
cHTML? crapHTML?

[19:05:03.0000] <lazni>
=)

[19:06:00.0000] <boblet>
cHTML sites are basically web pre-tables. text formatting and images, baby, with <hr> for hawtness

[19:06:01.0000] <boblet>
compact, but may as well be

[19:06:02.0000] <lazni>
wow, I'm not old enough to know about cHTML

[19:07:00.0000] <boblet>
/me wishes there was a min-font-size property

[19:07:01.0000] <tabatkins>
boblet: What are you trying to do?

[19:08:00.0000] <boblet>
tabatkins: I’ve hacked bopomofo rendering together to demonstrate for an article on ruby, but due to browser font-size minimums if the base text isn’t huge the bopomofo pops out

[19:09:00.0000] <tabatkins>
And you can't just set "ruby { font-size: foo; }"

[19:09:01.0000] <tabatkins>
?

[19:09:02.0000] <boblet>
Trying to do this, but with ltr text : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo#Writing

[19:10:00.0000] <boblet>
tabatkins: you presuppose decent browser support for ruby :|

[19:10:01.0000] <boblet>
no one has tackled bopomofo — it’s an i18n train wreck

[19:11:00.0000] <boblet>
the CSS3 ruby module passes the buck to the OS

[19:11:01.0000] <tabatkins>
Well, true.  But hacking CSS to get around bad ruby support seems like a waste of time, when you could equally spend effort getting proper ruby support.  ^_^

[19:11:02.0000] <boblet>
and no one even implemented it

[19:11:03.0000] <tabatkins>
I think Ishida is taking on the Ruby module?

[19:11:04.0000] <theMadness>
lazni, if anyone has the tools to do it, it's ppk. Maybe send him a shout?

[19:12:00.0000] <lazni>
theMadness: true

[19:12:01.0000] <boblet>
tabatkins: that presupposes I had the skillz to help ;) writing about it is the best I can do

[19:12:02.0000] <boblet>
yeah I need to email Richard

[19:12:03.0000] <theMadness>
We might get a good, informative piece about it.

[19:13:00.0000] <boblet>
tabatkins: writing for html5doctor on ruby so want to demonstrate bopomofo, and given zero browser support I thought I’d hack it rather than using a design app

[19:13:01.0000] <boblet>
no idea how to reorder inline blocksfor Korean though

[19:14:00.0000] <boblet>
need to swap the order of base text and ruby text

[19:15:00.0000] <tabatkins>
Hrm.  Asain writing modes are complex.

[19:16:00.0000] <tabatkins>
/me heads out for the weekend.

[19:16:01.0000] <boblet>

[19:16:02.0000] <boblet>
if anyone is interested here’s bopomofo via font-size and vertical-align: http://oli-studio.com/temp/bopomofo.png

[19:17:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: you’d like that phrase btw ;-)

(applied with lots of spans)

[19:18:00.0000] <theMadness>
That brings me back (I grew up on a steady diet of violent anime)

[19:19:00.0000] <boblet>
theMadness: hehe. Chinese anime?

[19:19:01.0000] <theMadness>
Nope, mostly fist of the north star.

[19:19:02.0000] <boblet>
theMadness: check this: http://redsungamer.com/index.php/site/fotns-taunt-kills/

[19:20:00.0000] <boblet>
should take you back :)

[19:20:01.0000] <theMadness>
Yeah, also God Hand had a very similar style.

[19:20:02.0000] <theMadness>
With a thick tongue-in-cheek undertone, yet.

[19:29:00.0000] <boblet>
ooh interesting! absolute font sizes do scale to illegible — minimum font size only respected for relative

[19:30:00.0000] <boblet>
(Chrome)

[19:31:00.0000] <boblet>
also seems to change % vertical-align distances

[19:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
i present to you: the longest list of subtitle formats ever written on the internet (as far as I am aware):

yikes

[19:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone can out-google-fu my attempts at finding information about the sections marked "Couldn't find a specification for this format" or the like, please let me know

[19:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
consider it a challenge

[19:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
i'm looking for, in order of preference:

[19:55:06.0000] <Hixie>
1. formal specs

[19:55:07.0000] <Hixie>
2. word-of-mouth specs

[19:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
3. examples files

[19:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
4. rumours

[19:57:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: any Japanese ones? I might have luck there

[19:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
no idea, that's the problem :-)

[19:57:02.0000] <boblet>
har

[19:57:03.0000] <boblet>

[20:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: is that a subtitle-related format?

[20:49:00.0000] <boblet>

woops, my mistake. *1000+* page specs

[21:03:00.0000] <boblet>
in an alternate universe which recreates a modified subset pretty much the entire web stack. a scary alternate universe

[21:26:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: I give up. the Japanese digital TV standard ARIB STD-B24 appears to encode captions using an XML-based modified version of XHTML, but I can’t find any y’know examples.

[21:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: well that's a start... can you add a section to that page just mentioning that?

[21:27:01.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: http://www.arib.or.jp/english/html/overview/doc/6-STD-B24v5_2-1p3-E1.pdf Part 3 of this PDF (PDF page 157, written as p139) has TOC for “Coding of caption and superimpose” section

it's more than i have for some of the others!

[21:28:00.0000] <boblet>
ohh believe me, in this case it may not be a good thing

"XML-based" is all i wrote :-)

[21:32:00.0000] <theMadness>
boblet, I can't tell you how unsettling is the combination of "human centered" and the image of huge knives.

[21:32:01.0000] <boblet>
it’s basically an entire browser spec; XHTML-based custom XML, subset of CSS

[21:32:02.0000] <theMadness>
I mean here http://oli-studio.com/images/knives.jpg

[21:32:03.0000] <boblet>
theMadness: har!

[21:32:04.0000] <boblet>
I really need to do something about that huh

[21:32:05.0000] <boblet>
http://oli.jp/ is the one I’ve actually updated since … 2005

[21:32:06.0000] <boblet>
:X

[21:32:07.0000] <boblet>
woops

[21:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
the stuff in part 3 seems to be a binary format

[21:33:01.0000] <boblet>
I guess :| then

[21:33:02.0000] <theMadness>
Backtracked it from the image you posted earlier.

[21:33:03.0000] <nessy>
are you looking at binary formats, too Hixie?

[21:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'm looking at everything

[21:34:00.0000] <nessy>
oh!

[21:34:01.0000] <nessy>
you got EBU then?

[21:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
Under "EBU STL" I just have "Couldn't find a specification for this format. Appears to be a binary format." :-)

[21:34:03.0000] <nessy>
standard on European TV

[21:34:04.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: huh. well I have no idea what this exquisitely detailed spec is actually for then. great detail in the definition, but what does it mean?

[21:34:05.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: yeah beats me

[21:35:00.0000] <nessy>
ah - I think I might have a copy floating around - it's binary and it's covered by some standard body you have to pay for the spec

[21:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
well that's pretty much all we need to know, so good :-)

[21:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: i changed it to "Apparently XML-based and/or binary based. Unclear. Appears to be rather complicated." :-)

[21:36:02.0000] <boblet>
lol

[21:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i haven't seen any reason to use a binary format, so i doubt we'll use one; i'm just trying to be thorough

[21:36:04.0000] <boblet>
thank science I found the English translation — was looking at the Japanese version to start with >_<

[21:37:00.0000] <boblet>
aargh!

[21:37:01.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: glad about that!

[21:37:02.0000] <boblet>
that is not the emoticon you are searching for

[21:37:03.0000] <nessy>
binary doesn't make sense in the Web context

[21:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
not for this kind of thing, no

[21:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: was the japanese one no clearer?

[21:39:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: pretty direct translation, so for me the Japanese one was just scary

[21:39:01.0000] <boblet>
so is the English one actually, so even more scary ;-)

[21:39:02.0000] <nessy>
just came across this list of subtitle formats - http://autocaption.com/resource_specifications_format_list.html <- scarily long!

[21:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
holy cow, they have a longer list than i do!

[21:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok to be fair their list is kind of a lie

[21:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. PAC and RAC are essentially the same

[21:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
yet they list them separately

[21:40:04.0000] <boblet>
nessy wins the internets!

[21:41:00.0000] <nessy>
unfortunately that list is useless without links to specs

[21:42:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie:  looks like STD-B24 is multimedia (including captions) ”The Appendix 2 contains the operational guidelines for implementing basic services by using the XML-based multimedia coding scheme specification responsible for the data broadcasting scheme”

[21:42:01.0000] <boblet>
so HDTV with whatever you want overlaid

[21:45:00.0000] <boblet>
also for sending to mobile phones with 1-seg (digital tv for mobile phones), over the net (I guess for net TV)

[21:45:01.0000] <nessy>
I once implemented a parser for it - it's not very difficult

[21:46:00.0000] <nessy>
it includes italics, underline and boxing for styling - no bold

[21:46:01.0000] <nessy>
very basic

[21:46:02.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: if you need more detail on this, ping me in a week and I’ll call them. It’d be the fastest way to find out a sample subtitle doc (public holiday until Thurs tho)

[23:28:00.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet, I am interested in the bopomofo thing, since I am a Taiwanese. Is there any thing I can help?

[23:32:00.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: I’d be really interested in examples of content on the web using bopomofo, especially if it uses ruby

[23:33:00.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: apart from that some photos of bopomofo in real life would be great, to get an idea of typical formatting

[23:33:01.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet, I asked this question to my Chinese friends once, but I am afraid there might be no examples.

[23:33:02.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: did you see the screenshot I posted? any mistakes?

[23:33:03.0000] <kennyluck>
Hmm... I can certainly get some pictures.

[23:34:00.0000] <kennyluck>
Yes, well not presentational ones, but a logical one.

[23:34:01.0000] <boblet>
please tell me

[23:34:02.0000] <kennyluck>
The characters are in simplified Chinese, where bopomofo is usually for traditional Chinese. :)

[23:34:03.0000] <boblet>
(it’s hard to make examples in a language you don’t understand ;-) )

[23:35:00.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet

[23:35:01.0000] <boblet>
can you tell me the traditional Chinese characters? also is the bopomofo correct?

[23:36:00.0000] <kennyluck>
Hmm... the traditional character for the third one is 無

[23:36:01.0000] <kennyluck>
Also, I guess usually the bopomofo would be vertically aligned.

[23:37:00.0000] <kennyluck>
I mean, for example, the bopomofo for the fifth character should be put down a little bit, so that it's in the middle, boblet.

[23:38:00.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: damn, I thought you might say that :)

[23:38:01.0000] <kennyluck>
:)

[23:38:02.0000] <boblet>
wow, surprised 無 became 无

[23:38:03.0000] <kennyluck>
huh? what do you mean, boblet?

[23:39:00.0000] <kennyluck>
Are you using piying for typing, maybe?

[23:39:01.0000] <boblet>
“the traditional character for the third one is 無” ? you mean 无 → 無 right?

[23:39:02.0000] <kennyluck>
Yup

[23:40:00.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: no, c&p from http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Chinese_proverbs

[23:40:01.0000] <kennyluck>
Ah, I see. Simplified Chinese is much more popular obviously.

[23:44:00.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet, a picture of a children newspaper in Taiwan: http://wss.djes.tp.edu.tw/report/Lists/Photos/951222%E5%9C%8B%E8%AA%9E%E6%97%A5%E5%A0%B1/%E5%9C%8B%E8%AA%9E%E6%97%A5%E5%A0%B1.jpg

[23:45:00.0000] <kennyluck>
Unlike in Japan, bopomofo is for children, so there would rarely be any examples.

[23:47:00.0000] <boblet>
updated pic http://oli-studio.com/temp/bopomofo.png looking ok now?

[23:47:01.0000] <Traveler8>
hi

[23:47:02.0000] <Traveler8>
Is it ok if I use a heading inside an ul?

[23:47:03.0000] <boblet>
Traveler8: only if it’s inside a li element

[23:47:04.0000] <Traveler8>
like <ul><h2>title</h2><li>some text</li></ul>

[23:48:00.0000] <Traveler8>
so then I have to use a <p> for the other li?

[23:48:01.0000] <kennyluck>
oops, sorry again, boble, but  难 → 難. The alignment looks great! 

[23:48:02.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet

[23:48:03.0000] <boblet>
Traveler8: nope. split your lists and put headings between, make ‘rich’ list items (eg <li><h2>…</h2><p>…</p></li>) or nest lists

[23:49:00.0000] <Traveler8>
i see

[23:49:01.0000] <Traveler8>
yeah that makes a lot of sense

[23:49:02.0000] <boblet>
Traveler8: be wary of using lists for formatting though. start by looking at your content and deciding what each piece is. work out styling/CSS *after* markup

[23:49:03.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: thanks…

[23:52:00.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: btw I’d say that furigana is for kids too, as there aren’t many kanji outside the 3000~ recommended ones used in mainstream media. although no argument that Chinese readers can definitely claim superiority in the kanji reading dept ;-)

[23:53:00.0000] <Traveler8>
what if i use <ul><h2></h2><li></li></ul>

[23:53:01.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: ok, final check please!

[23:53:02.0000] <boblet>
Traveler8: you said that already

[23:53:03.0000] <Traveler8>
oh right lol

[23:53:04.0000] <Traveler8>
sorry

[23:53:05.0000] <boblet>
alternately try it and c&p into a validator

[23:54:00.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet, perfect now.

[23:54:01.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: sweet. any larger examples of bopomofo? eg kids’ flashcards or something… ideally something culturally cool like a popular manga or something

[23:55:00.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet, I simply wanted to say I would never see a bopomofo on a newspaper or a novel, so the need for ruby is little. But sometimes you still see furigana in a novel if the character's name is too unusual.

[23:55:01.0000] <kennyluck>
Hmm..

[23:55:02.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: true true

[23:56:00.0000] <kennyluck>
I can't remember seeing bopomofo on a manga.

[23:56:01.0000] <boblet>
my pinyin example is talking about Grass Mud Horse (草泥馬) so I’d prefer to not be too boring with bopomofo ;-)

[23:56:02.0000] <kennyluck>
Is that a child story? I am not to familiar with all the literature stuff :)

[23:57:00.0000] <kennyluck>
s/to/that/

[23:57:01.0000] <boblet>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_mud_horse (a little texturally NSFW)

[23:58:00.0000] <kennyluck>
lol, I see what this is now. Mainland Chinsese people are certainly creative.

[23:59:00.0000] <boblet>
oh gotta go. bbl — kennyluck leave anything for me and I’ll check when I get back (ruby article to publish on http://html5doctor.com soon)

[23:59:01.0000] <kennyluck>
Ok, cool!

[23:59:02.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: lol. indeed!

[00:07:00.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet, I am a bit interested in how ruby deals with the case that you use bopomofo for writing and not just for annotating Chinese characters. Such as in http://pic.pimg.tw/hinlin/4b2f1500b2a23.jpg

[00:09:00.0000] <kennyluck>
I mean, is there ruby use case for *grouping* characters. Japanese and Chinese don't use space for splitting character groups, you know.

[00:45:00.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: interesting—hadn’t thought of that, as Japanese (what I’m familiar with) generally separates by the change from kanji to kana. Japanese childrens’ books with no kanji separate hiragana words using spaces

[00:45:01.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: also I think your use case is probably not applicable for ruby, as ruby is about annotating base text with ruby text, and if you only use bopomofo there’s not base/ruby text distinction

[00:47:00.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: if you can please tell me more about what you’d like to do for grouping characters, how you’d use it, and give some links to examples of this ‘in the wild’ (if possible)

[00:54:00.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet, well, huh, I am not familiar with Ruby, just wonder whether this will be a use case so that the space separating words would be automatically generated by a custom CSS style sheet or something.

[00:56:00.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: the easiest way would be using the space bar to add spaces ;-)

[00:56:01.0000] <kennyluck>
:)

[00:57:00.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet, I agree with you (ref. this is irrelevant to Ruby). But...what about the character for annotating pronunciation in bopomofo? I thought this is a case for double ruby?

[00:58:00.0000] <kennyluck>
Or complex ruby is the right term?

[00:58:01.0000] <boblet>
if we only have kanji and bopomofo then simple ruby should be enough

[01:00:00.0000] <boblet>
if we have kanji, bopomofo and pinyin then nested simple ruby will probably be enough

[01:01:00.0000] <boblet>
atm the only thing complex ruby would help with is Korean, which has ruby text *before* base text, and base text is in brackets (opposite to normal)

[01:06:00.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: does that sound good? or is there something else you want to do?

[01:07:00.0000] <kennyluck>
boblet, I am now investigating into the CSS writing-mode attribute to see how it looks if all the characters are bopomofo.

[01:08:00.0000] <kennyluck>
And the writing-mode vertical.

[01:08:01.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: only works in IE. IE8 is best

[01:08:02.0000] <kennyluck>
OK, gave up. I am in Mac osX.

[01:08:03.0000] <kennyluck>
sigh.

[01:09:00.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: still, nice that IE actually supports something eh :)

[01:09:01.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: but if you have comments on how you think it *should* work, that would be good too!

[01:10:00.0000] <kennyluck>
Yeah, I think MS people do care about the those i18 stuff. MSDN pages are always language content negotiate able.

[01:10:01.0000] <kennyluck>
Don't know, I have to make examples to see how messy it is if all the characters are bopomofo

[01:11:00.0000] <kennyluck>
Well, it's irrelevant to Ruby, I suppose.

[01:12:00.0000] <kennyluck>
I thought the tone mark was made by Ruby annotation, but it's not, it seems.

[01:12:01.0000] <kennyluck>
I mean, alignment of the tone mark.

[01:12:02.0000] <boblet>
kennyluck: that screenshot was faked using CSS

[01:12:03.0000] <kennyluck>
Note: The Bopomofo transcription is written in the normal way as part of the ruby text. The user agent is responsible for ensuring the correct relative alignment and positioning of the glyphs, including those corresponding to the tone marks, when displaying as vertical ruby.  ( from w3c CSS3 ruby module)

[01:13:00.0000] <boblet>
yep, that’s one of the issues W3 Style WG was having problems with

[01:14:00.0000] <boblet>
OSes don’t provide that framework atm, and it’s a lot for a UA to provide

[01:14:01.0000] <boblet>
afaik

It's the png/gif debacle all over again.

[01:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but significantly worse if any comes of it

[01:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
At least with GIF, IIRC, the patents only covered the encoding process, which is why browsers could ship the GIF decoders

[01:42:00.0000] <theMadness>
And with video people is probably willing to host 2 copies of the encoding.

[01:43:00.0000] <theMadness>
Possibly both the formats will be in the spec as recommendations.

http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/04/html5-video-in-internet-explorer-9-h264-and-h264-alone.ars

Windows 7 already has some sort of support for it.

[01:47:00.0000] <theMadness>
Nice summary article tho.

[01:49:00.0000] <theMadness>
but there's nothing preventing Google from producing a VP8 plugin for Media Foundation, for example. -- heck, they did chrome frame, that should be a cakewalk in comparison.

[01:53:00.0000] <theMadness>
Also, h264 needs a way more marketable name.

[01:53:01.0000] <theMadness>
It sounds like a very weird strand of influenza.

[02:00:00.0000] <nessy>
Theora's name is not much better ;)

[02:00:01.0000] <theMadness>
At least I can remember that. :/

[02:01:00.0000] <nessy>
but honestly - I don't understand how Steve Jobs can stand up and honestly declare there is a patent pool being put together against Theora, unless he is part of it or knows of something happening - unless of course it's MPEG-LA putting the pool together - that would be active combat then opposed to FUD only - I doubt they will actually go there - might lose them their FUD advantage!

[06:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"With the adoption of RDFa, we're seeing a very sharp up-tick in the use of xmlns: and Facebook has furthered this by requiring the "fb" namespace in Facebook application markup."

[06:34:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Why don't we just make prefixes significant already...

[06:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
nessy, I wouldn't underestimate the greed and anti-competitive goals of the MPEG-LA. It's their goal to ensure that their codecs are the most widely used, and to stifle innovation and prevent competition in any way they can.

[06:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm quite sure that the members are searching through their patent portfolios to do anything they can to prevent competition from Theora

[06:44:00.0000] <nessy>
sure, but I haven't seen MPEG-LA themselves attacking ppl - they are mostly there to collect licensing fees

[06:44:01.0000] <nessy>
royalties

[06:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
I expect that's what they plan to do with Theora too, if they put together a patent pool

[06:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Goalposts shifting at the speed of a CPU...

[06:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
though, it really depends on so many factors and the validity of the patents could be in question, if the In re Bilski supreme court case comes back with the only sensible verdict against software patents

[06:48:02.0000] <Dashiva>
"These new elements won't be implemented" becomes "They don't do anything useful anyway" returning to "We don't need them because of script libraries"

[06:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's like that story of the borrowed kettle

[06:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
what story of the borrowed kettle?

[06:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(1) I never borrowed a kettle from you, (2) I returned it to you unbroken, (3) the kettle was already broken when I got it from you. 

[07:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What is the sound of progress not happening?

[07:43:00.0000] <nessy>
Lachy: Theora is not the same as MPEG codecs - the MPEG codecs are deliberately developed to include patents from companies and at the end companies put up their hand to claim their stake already knowing they have their stuff in it; a Theora patent pool developed by MPEG-LA would require companies to care enough to determine that Theora actually uses their patents, then get together with other companies to agree on a patent pool; this would ne

Ubuntu One doesn't seem very good... searching for e.g. "dr dre" gives you a picture of 2001 as first result but clicking that gives a completely different album

[15:27:02.0000] <annevk2>
makes no sense

[15:29:00.0000] <annevk2>
searching for "air" gives "us air force tactical air command band" as first result rather than "air" (which they also have)

Hixie: clearly we should extend selectors to allow multiple pseudo-elements video::cue(narrator)::fragment(i)

really?

[16:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: why clearly?

[16:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe not clearly, but it seems more natural to write the selector with two pseudo-elements

[16:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
otoh it's probably easier to implement with one pseudo-element

[16:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
certainly we could make it more complex, but i'd like to see the use cases before we do so :-)

[16:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to work out what the units of the numbers in the -webkit-gradient syntax are

[16:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
we really need to update to match the -moz-gradient syntax

[16:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or whatever the latest proposal is

[16:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
::cue(narrator, i) -- two arguments means fragment

zcorpan: wfm

[17:20:00.0000] <annevk>
I think it's confusing personally

[17:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
what i had isn't much better

[17:33:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess

User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0;

[19:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1) ; InfoPath.2)

[19:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
WHAT THE HECK.

[19:13:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
What genius decided to put both MSIE 6.0 and MSIE 8.0 in the IE8 UA string?  Ugh.

[19:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least sometimes . . .

[19:15:00.0000] <Rik`>
AryehGregor: Adobe

[19:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . .

[19:16:01.0000] <Rik`>
with the PDF reader iirc

[19:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Are you really saying that Adobe's PDF reader is adding "MSIE 6.0" to IE8 User-Agent strings?

[19:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's pathologically stupid.

[19:17:02.0000] <Rik`>
yes

[19:17:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
:/

[19:17:04.0000] <Rik`>
IE allows softwares to alter the UA

[19:17:05.0000] <Rik`>
and IE9 won't allow that

[19:18:00.0000] <Rik`>
so no more stupidity like this

[19:23:00.0000] <Rik`>
can't find a link about that, but I'm pretty sure it's an adobe product that inserts that in the registry

Hurrah.

[20:38:00.0000] <cardona507>
does <!doctype html> cause IE versions 6 and below to render in standards mode?

[21:20:00.0000] <theMadness>
Yes.

[21:21:00.0000] <theMadness>
They do trigger the doctype switching, the shortened doctype was picked because it was enough to incite said selection.

[21:39:00.0000] <cardona507>
thanks theMadness

[21:45:00.0000] <theMadness>
Don't mention it.

[23:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so url/URL didn't conclude with anything, or did it?

[23:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
no conclusion so far

[23:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
you've both made good points

[23:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm waiting to see what happens with implementations

[23:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't really like that approach, i think it'll result in half being url and the other half being URL

[23:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and we'll have to stick to that for compat

[23:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe StorageEvent.url is already too late to change anyway?

[00:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh, I didn't notice StorageEvent.url

[00:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be really nice to make them all consistent

[00:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
StorageEvent is the only place in WebKit's IDL that has an "url" attribute currently

[00:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
vs. Document, EventSource and WebSocket with URL

[00:06:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: it was called StorageEvent.uri until a few days ago in webkit

[00:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: if it just got renamed from "uri" then surely it can be renamed to "URL" too

[00:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah probably

[00:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there is another "uri" though:

[00:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
./svg/SVGPaint.idl:        readonly attribute DOMString uri;

[00:08:02.0000] <othermaciej>
several things with all-caps "URI" as the second word also

[00:08:03.0000] <zcorpan>
there's also node.baseURI

[00:08:04.0000] <othermaciej>
no urn or iri

[00:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: well i wanted to make it all URL but jonas said no. and so I changed it to all url and you said no. So I dunno what to do. For now the only browser that's actually consistently executing on their position is Mozilla, and they use url.

[00:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
has Mozilla implemented WebSocket or EventSource yet?

[00:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
no

[00:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
they have implemented File though

[00:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
did they change Document.URL?

[00:10:03.0000] <zcorpan>
they're working on websocket

[00:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
no

[00:10:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm ok with everything being "URL"

[00:10:06.0000] <Hixie>
convince jonas, not me

[00:10:07.0000] <othermaciej>
I am also ok with everything being "url" except for Document.URL

[00:10:08.0000] <Hixie>
that's what we have in the spec at the moment and what firefox is doing

[00:10:09.0000] <othermaciej>
I think what we'll actually end up with is an inconsistent mish-mash

[00:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
what is implemented in opera and webkit today is an inconsistent mish-mash already

[00:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
personally I don't buy jonas' camelCase argument

[00:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
in our trunk we seem to have all URL except for StorageEvent

[00:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
because that would suggest .uRL

[00:11:04.0000] <othermaciej>
heh

[00:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe you should call it that

[00:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
well, in WebKit code where the name is not forced by a spec, we try to follow the rule that an acronym is capitalized in the same way an initial letter would be in that place in an identifier

[00:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so class URL, method .urlFoo, method .fooURL

[00:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so I agree with Jonas on an abstract aesthetic level

[00:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I'm also not super enthusiastic about running around renaming things

[00:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: we'll have to rename some things anyway

[00:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
true

[00:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
may as well go with the scheme Jonas prefers then, since there's nothing wrong with it other than the legacy Document.URL not being able to comply

[00:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'll ask webkit-dev if anyone minds renaming EventSource.URL or WebSocket.URL

[00:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
of course, File.url should really be named something like File.tempURL to avoid the misleading impression that it is the file: URL for the file

[00:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: anything would be better than what we have now (.urn)

[00:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there a way to embed a block of text in mediawiki that might contain wiki-like syntax but have it all be escaped? the equivalent of <xmp> in HTML or <![CDATA[ in XML?

[00:30:00.0000] <danbri>
including markup which would show up as real markup in the Web site, you mean?

[00:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i want to paste in some wiki markup and have it show up like i wrote it, not interpreted

[00:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
alternatively is there some way of escaping everything?

[00:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
like in html you can just escape < and & and then you're done?

[00:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: .urn at least doesn't imply that it's a file: URL

[00:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(but of course it's otherwise terrible

[00:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
)

[00:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
based on looking at all these subtitle formats, i think the original proposal of using SRT really is the least bad choice

[00:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://damowmow.com/temp/srtspec is a possible format based on it

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've updated the ::cue() idea based on what zcorpan suggested

[01:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1396575#post1396575

[01:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wait, there's a caption format called "ASS"?

[01:14:00.0000] <lazni>
An Subtitle Standard?

[01:14:01.0000] <lazni>
s/an/a/

[01:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: by the way - Eric Carlson told me the other day that there are some YouTube videos that have fancy captions using some complicated XML format - he said he'd add it to the wiki, not sure if he's had time

[01:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i think you can escape as in html

[01:15:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: at least i've used &lt;!-- for <!--

[01:34:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
any reason why we don't have expanding textareas in the spec yet?

[01:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ooh. Hixie writes BNF. Did we enter a parallel universe?

[01:44:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
/me crosses back over from the parallel universe.

[01:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: where?

[02:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: BNF is a good format for defining what's valid (though that's pretty much all it's good for)

[03:30:00.0000] <daedb>
Hixie: <nowiki> works in Mediawiki.

[04:30:00.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: is there anything on how websocket servers should determine which protocol version that they should use?

[04:30:01.0000] <micheil>
like, a version negotiation

[05:34:00.0000] <theMadness>
Ok, this is a personal matter, but it's somewhat relevant. I just ended a discussion with a guy who supposedly is "in the know" of the w3c circles, and we have to start a project together.

[05:35:00.0000] <theMadness>
Apparently he's of the idea that using html4-like markup with a html5 doctype and some of the new input types is a reckless approach.

[05:36:00.0000] <theMadness>
What's worse is that he's boasting that it's the common opinion of all the people in the business. And that such an approach should be attempted only for personal or experimental sites.

[05:36:01.0000] <theMadness>
I'm about to call bullshit.

[05:37:00.0000] <boblet>
HTML4.5 (HTML5 doctype but no new elements) is perfectly cromulent

[05:38:00.0000] <theMadness>
thanks boblet, I needed the reassurance.

[05:38:01.0000] <boblet>
the dude is thinking of stuff <= IE 8 doesn’t support without JS

[05:39:00.0000] <boblet>
sectioning elements etc

[05:39:01.0000] <theMadness>
Nono, he's actively against stuff like input type="email".

[05:39:02.0000] <theMadness>
or the attribute "required"

[05:39:03.0000] <boblet>
input types are np — browsers treat em as type="text" if they don’t understand

[05:40:00.0000] <theMadness>
I know! But apparently everyone at the w3 (according to him) is secretly divulging the "do not use yet" mantra while apparently supporting early adoption on the public site.

[05:41:00.0000] <theMadness>
I felt like in a Lewis Carroll book. But this is potentially offtopic, so I'll stfu.

[05:41:01.0000] <boblet>
theMadness: all the people I know at W3 are saying use it in private too

[05:41:02.0000] <boblet>
oh noes! I’m not in the inner circle!! :|

[05:41:03.0000] <boblet>
point him at http://diveintohtml5.org/forms.html#type-email for input types

[05:42:00.0000] <theMadness>
Yeah I gave him that link too.

[06:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
theMadness: It's safer to listen to WHATWG mantras, since there isn't a big private/public divide and people can't be sharing secret opinions :-)

[06:22:00.0000] <boblet>
Philip`: you’re just saying that because you’re one of the inner circle members!! aha! I exposed you

[06:22:01.0000] <boblet>
protestations will only strengthen the case against you, my friend

[06:22:02.0000] <boblet>
;-)

[06:22:03.0000] <theMadness>
Philip`, and that would be?

[06:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Will admitting it also strengthen the case?

[06:23:01.0000] <boblet>
Philip`: you catch on fast. have you played this game before?

[06:24:00.0000] <boblet>
everyone is guilty until proven innocent, including the people proven innocent

[06:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: What about the treehouse?

[06:24:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Seems private to me

[06:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
theMadness: That would probably be that lots of features are fine to use (like the new doctype, and like new input types as long as you test your site in a browser that supports them to make sure you're not using them wrong)

[06:27:00.0000] <theMadness>
I'm an Opera user, so I'm covered there, the features I'm intrested in using are input attributes and states, plus maybe video for iphone|ipad.

[06:29:00.0000] <theMadness>
On a unrelated node, anyone has a plugin to choke people over skype?

[06:33:00.0000] <theMadness>
Possibly with the "omae wa mo, shindeiru" soundclip prior to said choking.

[07:52:00.0000] <theMadness>
<meta charset="utf-8"> works in all browsers or should I still use content-type?

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
It works in all browsers

[07:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
though ideally you should send the charset in the HTTP Content-Type too

[07:59:02.0000] <Dashiva>
theMadness: The choking is too obviousl. Also, "mou"

[08:09:00.0000] <theMadness>
Dashiva, I'm used to macrons with romaji :(

[08:09:01.0000] <theMadness>
I hate transliterations without the pretty lines, but this stupid client won't let me.

[08:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, the irony

[08:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You transliterate the original Japanese to a form that's actually harder to write

[08:10:02.0000] <theMadness>
Not here, I have a spiffy keyboard layout that lets me write silly stuff. :D

[08:11:00.0000] <theMadness>
I just need to add a unicode <3 to be the perfect teenager girl. And of course the snowman.

[08:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Don't need a keyboard layout for that, IME ❤❥❤

[08:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Even comes with ☃

[08:26:00.0000] <theMadness>
Fact is, I'm into finger bondage. If it's not worth getting cramps over, it's not worth typing.

Yep.

http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/ oh, Hixie is there too.

[09:39:01.0000] <boogyman>
I am sure that the w3c site has a contact page

[10:11:00.0000] <theMadness>
Sent a mail to www-style. Hopefully it'll reach someone.

[10:11:01.0000] <theMadness>
But just in case: http://paste2.org/p/806357

[10:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
theMadness, www-style is the correct place. It's a very active mailing list

[10:14:01.0000] <theMadness>
I see.

[10:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
theMadness, but your mail hasn't arrived

[10:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
You should have received a confirmation e-mail from the mailing list asking you to agree to the archival of your message

[10:16:01.0000] <theMadness>
I gave it permission on the review page, id=8e869d7cae2ef4aaa880

[10:16:02.0000] <theMadness>
Yes, I agreed with the topmost option.

[10:16:03.0000] <Lachy>
weird then, that it's not showing up here http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010May/

[10:16:04.0000] <theMadness>
It's probably being moderated.

[10:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
It sometimes takes a day or two for your first message to a list

[10:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
(where "sometimes" means "always, in my experience")

[10:18:00.0000] <theMadness>
I see. Well, the paste is archived in the IRC log at least, so it's not completely totally absolutely lost.

[10:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
theMadness, similar ideas to yours have been discussed in the CSSWG many times in the past

[10:21:00.0000] <theMadness>
Always rejected?

[10:22:00.0000] <theMadness>
Weird, it's so clear that people has a use for it, and it's not like it's something complex to put in specification.

[10:22:01.0000] <theMadness>
I guess I'm wishing for a level of defensive coding that is too high.

[10:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
The problem is that the level of support for a feature is not always a binary decision.

[10:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
Some implementations may only ship with partial support for a property, or they may claim full support, while having a bug that causes some significant aspect to function wrongly.

[10:24:02.0000] <theMadness>
But for that we have vendor prefixes right?

[10:25:00.0000] <theMadness>
Of course, but what's the alternative?

[10:25:01.0000] <theMadness>
I mean, I know it wouldn't be perfect.

[10:25:02.0000] <theMadness>
But it's not like we have better stuff at hand...

[10:27:00.0000] <theMadness>
I mean, when I declare color:red, I know that the browser can have a bug and interpret red as green and give me green text, but that can't be a valid argument.

[10:27:01.0000] <Rik`>
theMadness: webkit introduced some new media queries with transforms/transitions, etc

[10:28:00.0000] <Rik`>
http://webkit.org/specs/MediaQueriesExtensions.html

[10:28:01.0000] <theMadness>
That's a very limited form of what I was suggesting.

[10:29:00.0000] <theMadness>
I'm not a strong application developer, I'm much better at web stuff, but would it be that hard to expose a series of flags in pseudoclass form?

[10:30:00.0000] <theMadness>
And yes Lachy, I'd accept the browser position on the subject, if the browser is lying or is sloppy, I'll have to make do.

[16:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Hixie: I think we can usefully define ::disclosure and ::content pseudos for <details> as the default binding, without stepping on future development of the bindings in real XBL.

[16:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins__>
That would solve the most pressing styling issues.

[16:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins__>
With the structure generally being <details><summary><::disclosure/></summary><::content/></details>.

[16:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Though there are alternate ways a UA could represent <details> that would still work well with ::disclosure and ::content.

[16:26:00.0000] <ment>
pardon my ignorance, but what's "<::disclosure/>" supposed to mean?

[16:27:00.0000] <ment>
(or any tag starting with double-colon)

[16:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins__>
A pretend ::disclosure pseudoelement (from CSS).

[16:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Self-closed for example brevity.

[16:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins__>
It's nothing to do with namespaces or anything, it's just a convenient way to express the shadow element that gets created when you use a pseudoelement in CSS.

[16:28:01.0000] <Dashiva>
What happens to content before summary?

[16:28:02.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Dashiva: Two <::content> elements?

[16:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Makes me wonder how browsers would render a <details> with content both before and after the summary

[16:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Me too.

[16:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins__>
I presume the <summary> would jump down when you opened the element.

[16:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Alternately, everything gets reordered in the box tree so that it comes after <summary>?

[16:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The element's shadow tree is expected to take the element's first child summary element, if any, and place it in a first 'block' box container, and then take the element's remaining descendants, if any, and place them in a second 'block' box container.

[16:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Well, the content model explicitly has <summary> coming first, so shrug.

[16:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Excellent, that's what I thought.

 Each list of which requires one, zero or more, or one or more numbers to be matched from a set of numbers, either in sequence or in any order depending on the list.

[20:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
 So for example, a pattern could be "sequence(1, one-of(2, sequence(20, 21)), zero-or-one-of(3, 4), one-or-more-of(5, 6, one-of(7, 8), 9)".

[20:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
 The sequence 1,2,4,8,9 would match it, as would 1,20,21,5,6,7,9, but 1,2,7,8,9 would not, and nor would 1,20,3,4,9.

[20:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
 The question is, what's a good way to represent these patterns in memory that is both fast to evaluate and reasonably memory efficient?

[20:09:05.0000] <Hixie>
The quickest way to evaluate them seems to be to compute every match and then form a state machine tree to walk down, but that is pathalogical in some common cases.

[20:09:06.0000] <Hixie>
For example one-or-more-of(one-or-more-of(1,2,3),one-or-more-of(4,5,6),one-or-more-of(7,8,9)) has 495 permutations if I worked it right.

[20:09:07.0000] <Hixie>
I tried looking up things like "how to compile regular expressions" but it's all about how to use them, not how to compile them.

[20:28:00.0000] <roc>
maybe just keep a set of positions within your tree

[20:28:01.0000] <roc>
and scan the input updating that set after each number

[20:31:00.0000] <roc>
depending on your workload, you could compile it to a nondeterministic finite state machine and minimize the number of states using standard algorithms, but that adds quite a lot of complexity and may not perform any better

[20:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough

[20:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[20:38:00.0000] <doublec>
Hixie, did you come across Russ Cox's articles on compiling regular expressions?

[20:38:01.0000] <doublec>
eg: http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp3.html

[20:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
i did not, will read, thanks

[20:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: isn't that effectively a regular expression?

[20:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[20:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm pretty sure your language is a regular language

[20:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
hence my looking up stuff on compiling regexps

[20:52:04.0000] <othermaciej>
in which case, my suggestion would be to express the problem in a form in which you can use an out-of-the-box regexp engine

[20:52:05.0000] <Hixie>
doublec's url got me something more useful though

[20:52:06.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, that might be a good idea

[20:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
part of the goal here is to learn more about how to write this kind of thing, though

[20:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if you really want to hand-code something, a DFA would be most efficient for matching

[20:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[20:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
though it could be costly to compute up front

[20:53:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I've seen implementations that do lazy NFA-to-DFA conversion, but that is complicated

[20:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
in this case, that's turns out to not be an issue

[20:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
since the compilation step is far removed from the matching step

[20:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
and only the latter is time-sensitie

[20:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
ve

[20:54:03.0000] <othermaciej>
a DFA would be faster to match against than an NFA

[20:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you don't have to compute every match to make a state machine

[20:56:01.0000] <roc>
yes

[20:56:02.0000] <roc>
the only other thing you have to worry about is DFA size explosion

[20:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(otherwise you'd have a hell of a time compiling any regexp that uses the * operator)

[21:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
the case i'm having the most trouble with when converting this to a state machine is the "zero or more of the following, in any order: ..." expression

[21:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
(which i notice regular expressions don't really support)

[21:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
(but which is quite important for my application)

[21:03:00.0000] <roc>
isn't that just (A | B | C | D)* ?

[21:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
sorry, i forgot to clarify: no duplicates

[21:03:02.0000] <roc>
ah right

[21:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
in my original approach earlier today i was considering just mutating my state machine as i walked it

[21:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that doesn't work so well with either the back-tracking or "following all states at once" approaches

[21:05:00.0000] <roc>
yeah you need 2^N states for that

[21:05:01.0000] <roc>
so a DFA is not going to work too well if you have more than a small number of alternatives

[21:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, that's been my conclusion too

[21:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
zero or more with no duplicates shouldn't require 2^N states

[21:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be O(N^2) states

[21:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
my N will be around 10 for many of these patterns

[21:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
and many patterns will have several of these and/or nest them

[21:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
10^2 is not that big

[21:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
actually I guess I am oversimplifying things, since it's variable length, the number of states depends on the following operator

[21:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in an NFA it would be O(N^2) for sure

[21:18:00.0000] <roc>
I'm confused

[21:19:00.0000] <roc>
if you have N possible objects and you have to avoid duplicates, then at any given point in matching a string, you have to remember which subset of the N objects you have seen so far

[21:19:01.0000] <roc>
that's 2^N states

[21:19:02.0000] <roc>
for a DFA

[21:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
for zero-or-more (no duplicates) and N=3, i count 10 states

[21:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
(not counting the terminal state)

[21:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
for N=2 i count 3 states

[21:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
N=3 is just three N=2s with a state on the front

[21:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
assuming N=4 is four N=3s with a state on the front, that'd be 41 states for N=4

[21:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
(this is for an NFA, obviously, since I'm ignoring whatever comes next)

[21:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
(so one of the transitions at each state is to just move on to the next part of the NFA)

[21:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A002627

[21:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
that list gets way out of hand far too quickly

[21:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
N=8 -> 69281 states

[21:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
N=13, which is plausible for my application, would have 10699776686 states

[21:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
what i need is a kind of NFA where i synthesis new states as i am walking it

[21:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
that might work

[21:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes...

[21:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Hixie: How fast does this have to be?  Shouldn't be too hard to make an actual greedy backtracer out of what you've got.

[21:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i have to convert it to a serialisable form anyway, might as well convert it to a state machine while i'm atit

[21:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Seems easier to just serialize something like you have above, and package it with your matcher.

[21:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[21:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's just for fun

[21:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins__>
All right.  I think that actually serializing it as a state machine won't be fun, though.  ^_^

[21:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins__>
But writing a matcher could be.

[21:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
writing a state machine would be near-trivial if it wasn't for this particularly weird case

[23:41:00.0000] <theMadness>
Wait a minute, the specs are written in html4.01

[23:47:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
 hi, is there a way to get canvas fallback working when JS is disable in Firefox ?

[00:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins___>
theMadness: Yeah, w3c doesn't yet allow their specs to be written in HTML5, and it's too much effort to write the WHATWG version in HTML5 and down-convert to HTML4 for the w3c version.

[00:45:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
any tutorial explaining how to add link to a canvas text ?

[00:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins__: actually the whatwg one is written in HTML5 and I have a script to down-convert it to HTML4 for the W3C

[00:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
it takes out some of the examples that use HTML5

[00:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Hm. I thought I'd heard you saying the opposite.  Shrug.

[00:54:00.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: I've finally got the draft75 websocket server working in node, and it's written in a way to also be able to easily work with draft76

[00:54:01.0000] <micheil>
(it's just a matter of sorting out the handshaking code)

[00:56:00.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: is draft76 going to become draft76 on the ieft site?

[01:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
micheil: the ietf asked me to stop sending them updates because they couldn't cope with the volume of updates, so no idea

[01:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i'm concerned, -75 is long dead

[01:05:02.0000] <micheil>
oh, righteo

[01:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
if i'd still been sending updates, -76 would actually be like -90 or so by now

[01:05:04.0000] <micheil>
yeah, -75 is still the one supported by chrome (and other clients), so it's the one I must have work

[01:06:00.0000] <micheil>
is there a way to see the changes made to the spec (like a git diff)

[01:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
svn diffs of all the changes made to the whatwg specs are at http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker

[01:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's no per-section breakdown

[01:07:01.0000] <micheil>
there's just three sources to read the spec, so it sometimes gets confusing as to which one to conform to

[01:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
well right now it's too early to be doing anything but experimental work, so it's not a big deal

[01:08:00.0000] <micheil>
well, true, although, I'd like to be able to make my websocket server ready for when we do see a final version of the spec

[01:10:00.0000] <micheil>
in node, we've just added in support for things like http upgrade, so that when a client requests an upgrade (eg a websocket server), it can be handled appropriately, while still allowing a http server to function normally

[01:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8979 interesting WONTFIX

[01:15:00.0000] <Traveler>
hi

[01:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Is there anything is the spec that disassociates form-associated elements from their forms when the form-associated elements are re-inserted into a document?

[01:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in particular, when the fragment created by the fragment parsing algorithm is inserted by the innerHTML setter

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[01:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
this? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dfnReturnLink-11

[01:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
"When a form-associated element's ancestor chain changes, e.g. because it or one of its ancestors was inserted or removed from a Document, then the user agent must reset the form owner of that element."

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
(dfnReturnLink are dynamic and not portable)

[02:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok. thanks

[02:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
see http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#concept-form-association

[02:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
there's various other conditions that reset it

[02:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
next question: can the parser-created associations ever be observed in the fragment case? Maybe when createContextualFragement has been called but the fragment hasn't been inserted?

[02:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if the parser-created associations should simply be turned off in the fragment case

[02:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
unless i made a pretty serious mistake, there's no way to observe innerHTML until after it's in the document

[02:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
createContextualFragment in anyone's spec yet?

[02:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, who should I bother about it?

[02:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
what's createContextualFragment?

[02:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it's a Mozilla/Netscape ad hoc API that got cloned by WebKit and (IIRC) Presto

[02:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh jeez

[02:04:02.0000] <zcorpan>
http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-March/018892.html

[02:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
will you people stop making up new apis and implementing them widely

[02:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
i have enough trouble keeping track of the ones _i_ make up

[02:04:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh, it's on DOMRange

[02:04:06.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[02:04:07.0000] <Hixie>
well i expect i'll have to spec that one day

[02:04:08.0000] <Hixie>
but not any time soon

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. can a form be submitted if it hasn't been inserted into a document?

[02:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and if it can, do people do it?

[02:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
dunno, see the spec

[02:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
what does it say?

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it doesn't work if there's no associated browsing context

[02:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: in all browsers?

[02:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
so yes?

[02:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but a fragment that hasn't been inserted still has an associated document which has a browsing context

[02:07:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: looks like it can be submitted per spec

[02:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[02:07:05.0000] <Hixie>
makes sense i guess

[02:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
which means that it theory there can be someone somewhere calling createContextualFragment with a malformed form and calling .submit() on it

[02:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/it/in/

[02:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
when i spec createContextFragment, it'll still be "inserted into a document"

[02:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I don't follow. Surely the fragment has an owner document but it's not inserted

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
"inserted into a document" doesn't mean what it sounds like

[02:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's named that way because in most cases that's what happens

[02:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
hm actually i'm wrong

[02:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
nevermind

[02:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
i was thinking of xbl

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think the spec for form controls should be changed to just refer to the home subtree changing

[02:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
or something

[02:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i've not really paged any of this stuff in

[02:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
so i could be talking nonsense

[02:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
shepazu: any news on the SVG load event?

[02:24:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
how am I supposed to add link to a <canvas> ?

[02:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
shepazu: I just realized that one thing to consider is whether to fire the SVG load event when <svg> is parsed in an innerHTML setter

[02:39:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
how am I supposed to add link to a <canvas> ?

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
jstar-taiwan: use an onclick handler

[02:41:01.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
Hixie, there is no native way to do this o_O ?

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
no, intentionally

[02:45:01.0000] <webben>
jstar-taiwan: Note also http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#focus-management-0

[02:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
if you want to have interactive graphics, use svg

[02:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
or html

[02:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
<canvas> is meant for scripted graphics

[02:45:05.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
Hixie, but SVG is not supported correctly

[02:46:00.0000] <webben>
jstar-taiwan: Where?

[02:46:01.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
webben, IE

[02:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
IE doesn't do canvas either

[02:46:03.0000] <webben>
jstar-taiwan: http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/

[02:49:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
I understand there is way to get SVG or other w3c standards to work on IE, but it's not native

[02:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
IE doesn't support <canvas> either

[02:52:00.0000] <theMadness>
Uh, my mail made it through to www-style.

[02:53:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
Hixie, oh~ indeed I thought that IE8 add already a bit of support for it (i'm on linux)

[02:53:01.0000] <webben>
Nope.

[02:54:00.0000] <webben>
jstar-taiwan: Both svgweb and excanvas fake IE support with VML.

[02:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: doesn't svgweb use Flash?

[02:55:00.0000] <webben>
oh, yeah, sorry

[02:56:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
webben, Hixie does inline SVG work on IE8 ??

[02:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
no

[02:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
SVG and canvas only work in firefox, webkit browsers, and opera

[02:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
the ie9 preview has partial support for svg but no canvas

[02:57:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i speculate that some future ie9 preview will also have partial support for canvas

[02:57:02.0000] <theMadness>
Which is weird considering all the effort they are putting into making it a sort of directx thingie.

[02:58:00.0000] <roc>
and considering canvas is a lot easier to implement

[03:00:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
argh~ why do IE team take so much time to implement basic ~.~

[03:01:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
anyway do you have a sample on how to add links to a <canvas> ?

[03:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you're needing to add links to canvas you're almost certainly misusing canvas

[03:03:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
I'm willing to provide an alternative to a  flash diagram

[03:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
why not use svg?

[03:04:01.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
Hixie, it's a kind of pie chart with label which display text when clicked

[03:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jstar-taiwan: svg works for that use case better

[03:05:01.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
I wanted to try <canvas> and thought it was better supported

[03:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
canvas is more of a buzzword than svg, but for almost all non-game use cases svg is more appropriate

[03:11:00.0000] <jstar-taiwan>
yeap I tried it to know a bit more and it seem to bit another blob technology

[03:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I'm pretty sure I have written code that depends on submitting non-inserted forms

[03:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
(unless it doesn't work in which case I haven't, obviously)

[03:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder why http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/471 throws in opera

[03:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
also throws in firefox

[03:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
seems annoying to have to create a new event and copy all properties

[03:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: did you also use createContextualFragment with a malformed form?

[03:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
of course he did

[03:20:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and he put it in a library that was reused all over the place

[03:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: No :p

[03:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: good :-)

[03:21:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me still doesn't know what createContextualFragment does

[03:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
I would say that prevents me from using it but the web is empirical evidence against that line of thought

[03:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: it invokes the fragment parsing algorithm with a context node and a string to parse and returns a DocumentFragment

[03:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: it's like an innerHTML setter that gives you the fragment

[03:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Doesn't it work to createElement a context element .innerHTML it and read the children?

[03:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
Might not be such a clean API though

[03:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: createContextualFragment predates innerHTML in Gecko, IIRC

[03:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: from the era when IEism were bad but creating own vendor-specific ad hoc APIs was OK

[03:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
*IEisms

[03:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
Oh

[03:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd have to reread the CVS logs, but IIRC the use case was something in Netscape Composer and the API was exposed to the Web as a side effect

[03:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
how disappointing, i thought the wine IE in crossover would use trident, but it uses gecko 1.8

[03:28:01.0000] <zcorpan>
does ie throw if you click the border in http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/471 ?

[03:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh ie doesn't have dispatchEvent at all

[04:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
The Key Points slide at http://www.robglidden.com/2009/09/how-to-fix-dtv-patent-pools/ is interesting

[04:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like the TV people aren't too happy about MPEG encumberances, either

[04:52:00.0000] <roc>
Rob Glidden sounds like an interesting person

[05:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. the fake Gtk menus in Opera 10.52 have the ancient bug that prevents diagonal mouse movement to a submenu

[05:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for Firefox and Chrome get this right in their fake Gtk menus

[05:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/for/both/

[05:03:00.0000] <roc>
doesn't Chrome use real Gtk menus?

[05:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: possibly. I thought it used fake Gtk stuff, because the other controls don't look right at all and the title bar is in the uncanny valley

[05:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(specifically, the buttons in the title bar)

[05:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, that's not really surprising. The fake UI approach causes problems on many platforms, but is unfortunately how things are being done for cross platform development.

[05:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
I've unsuccessfully argued against the fake UI approach before

[05:12:00.0000] <roc>
the thing about browsers is that they have to go for the fake UI approach for Web content

[05:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like OO.o has the same bug

[05:12:02.0000] <roc>
so given you have to tackle a lot of the hard fake UI problems anyway, it makes it that much more attractive for your actual browser UI

[05:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
roc, yes, for web content, fake UI is essential. But for browser chrome, I believe that only native UI will give optimal results.

[05:13:01.0000] <roc>
maybe

[05:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It's better for the chrome to be consistent with the desktop than to be consistent with the browser content?

[05:14:01.0000] <roc>
another thing is that on Windows and X, the toolkits that give you "real UI" are pretty lame

[05:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess people who don't use any applications other than their browser would prefer the latter

[05:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
there are a whole bunch of Mac bugs in both Firefox and Opera that seem to be caused by the fake UI, especially in the nightly builds.

[05:15:02.0000] <roc>
at least, the ones you can access from C/C++

[05:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. After having the browser open for a while, it becomes impossible to resize the window or to click and drag the window from any area of the chrome overlayed with the fake UI.

[05:17:00.0000] <roc>
I haven't seen that one

[05:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: Just recompile Gecko in C++/CLI and then use WPF

[05:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
drop down, auto complete menus (e.g. address bar, search box, text fields) can start to only appear in a fixed position, and moving the window leaves them in place

[05:18:02.0000] <Lachy>
those 2 bugs require browser restarts to fix

[05:18:03.0000] <roc>
Philip`: ho ho ho

[05:18:04.0000] <Lachy>
they happen all the time on Snow Leopard

[05:18:05.0000] <roc>
I've seen that one

[05:18:06.0000] <roc>
but dropdowns are an example where using "real UI" is super-problematic in Web content

[05:19:00.0000] <roc>
Safari's "real UI" version of dropdowns is quite unusable for Web content with a large number of options

[05:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
roc, they usually occur at the same time. So when you see the drop downs appear in the wrong place, try resizing the window or moving the window by dragging on status bar.

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the checkboxes in fake Gtk menus in Opera look wrong, too

[05:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how the Opera 10.52 fake Gtk widgets are drawn

[05:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, please file bugs about those issues

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the pref window in Chrome looks like real Gtk

[05:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but the same window on Chrome OS looks generally terrible and Windows 95esque

[05:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how the Chrome pref window is implemented

[06:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
"When content loads in an iframe, after any load events are fired within the content itself, the user agent must queue a task to fire a simple event named load at the iframe element."

[06:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
What does it mean for content to load in an iframe?

[06:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I presume any URL change apart from a same-document reference will cause content  to load

[06:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
If you set location.href with a fragment reference, should it be done sync or async (esp. wrt reading back the URI from script)?

[08:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
IEBlog is really hit-and-miss, isn't it?  The last post was very informative.

[08:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was particularly interested by: "Microsoft receives back from MPEG-LA less than half the amount for the patent rights that it contributes because there are many other companies that provide the licensed functionality in content and products that sell in high volume. Microsoft pledged its patent rights to this neutral organization in order to make its rights broadly available under clear terms, not because it thought this might be a good rev

[08:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
enue stream. We do not foresee this patent pool ever producing a material revenue stream, and revenue plays no part in our decision here. "

[08:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess my working theory at this point is that Microsoft and Apple are probably just following the advice of their lawyers, as they claim, not engaging in some corporate strategy.  Maybe Google supports Theora because Google is still ambitious and risk-taking at this point, and hasn't yet lapsed into megacorporate conservatism despite its size.

[08:55:00.0000] <tabatkins>
We do try, AryehGregor.

[08:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I don't think the "they're making vast profits off the patent licensing" theory was ever the most credible one for possible corporate strategy reasons for wanting MPEG-LA to win

[08:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's more credible?  That open-source can't pay the fees?  Open-source projects are either backed by a company, which can pay the fees; or aren't, in which case they make no money and MPEG-LA doesn't care.

[08:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
s/open-source/open source/

[08:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
Small players in general (and new entrants to the market) can't pay the fees

[08:58:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I thought they were scaled somewhat reasonably.  Surely it's not in MPEG-LA's interest to discourage anyone from licensing?

[08:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's obviously easier for big companies due to the cap, of course.

[08:59:01.0000] <rektide>
i dont really understand why browsers dont just use whatever codecs are on the system?  or do they, and its just a matter of how the browser supplements the codec collection?

[08:59:02.0000] <jgraham>
Plus it is a real problem for open source becuase it menas that they have to distribute non-open-source components

[08:59:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
What do you mean?  There are open-source implementations of H.264, no?  Chrome uses ffmpeg, for example.

[08:59:04.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: My understanding is that any web browser would effectively have to pay the same amount

[09:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rektide: see roc's blog and roc's comment on the IE blog

[09:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
Although that is not based on anything much

[09:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, maybe with a web browser you'd hit the cap very quickly . . .

[09:00:03.0000] <rektide>
why not use gstreamer, and support everything?  there's a gstreamer-ffmpeg, for example.

[09:00:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
IIRC it's a fee per unit distributed, and if you give copies away you'd have to pay a lot.

[09:00:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
rektide, we don't want to support "everything", because in practice that means different browsers would support different things and we'd lose interoperability.

[09:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Plus it means more poorly-tested code paths, larger executable size, etc.

[09:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, well, all major platforms except XP and Vista have H.264 codecs installed by default or readily available, AFAIK, so the browser might not have to pay anything at all.

[09:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: FWIW I don't consider source-avaliable components that you are prevented from redistributing to be "open source"

[09:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(probably installed illegally on Linux, but again, nobody cares very much)

[09:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, no, they technically aren't open-source.  But in practice open-source people are resigned to having some not-fully-open-source components, unless you're rms.

[09:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: not caring is not a viable solution if you want linux to be successful

[09:02:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even Debian ships binary blobs in the kernel.

[09:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, distributions backed by a company with deep pockets can pay the fees.  Others will get ignored indefinitely.

[09:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is MPEG-LA going to sue Debian?  (Not sure if Debian actually distributes H.264 codecs, to be fair.)

[09:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I am loathe to depend on the kindness of patent trolls to ignore people who can't legitimately pay.

[09:03:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, so am I.

[09:03:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm talking purely pragmatically here.

[09:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
In addition, you're ignoring the middle case where people are profitable, but having to pay the licensing fees would cut their margins to thin to survive.

[09:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
This discussion started with the suggestion that Microsoft had ulterior motives for supporting H.264 over Theora, beyond patent risk.

[09:04:02.0000] <Dashiva>
How about just plain financial motives

[09:04:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't think that trying to hurt open source is a plausible motive, because open source doesn't have much of a problem with H.264 *in practice*.

[09:04:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, those being?

[09:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
binary blobs are about 1st party copyright or trade secret. h.264 is about 3rd party patents. totally different

[09:05:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Keeping small players out of the game

[09:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, I don't think MPEG-LA would go after anyone in that scenario, because it wouldn't be in their interest.

[09:05:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, hurting Firefox in particular could be a valid reason, given their hardline stance on the matter.  Whereas supporting Theora would just give Apple decent reason to switch over too.

[09:05:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, how does it keep small players out of the game?  OS X, Windows 7, and most Linux versions already include H.264 somehow, so browsers can just use those.

[09:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Again, I think you're assuming far too much from a patent-troll organization.

[09:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
MPEG-LA is not a patent troll.  Patent trolls are organizations that file for patents that are probably frivolous and that they won't ever use.

[09:06:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
MPEG-LA organizes patents that are definitely not all frivolous, and which its members do use.

[09:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Apparently that's not a viable solution according to anti-h264 arguments.

[09:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, I'm pretty sure I saw someone from Mozilla saying that if they supported H.264, they would indeed just use the system codec where available, and their reasons for not doing that were mainly idealistic.

[09:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(not that I disagree with them, although at this point it seems like a lost cause)

[09:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: The entire codec arena is so fraught with patent peril that the situation is much more ambiguous than you describe.  Virtually *anything* you can write in the codec space is covered by a patent somewhere.

[09:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, Gregory Maxwell of Xiph just wrote a fairly lengthy e-mail saying that that is exactly not the case.  It's only what MPEG-LA wants you to think.

[09:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/theora/2010-April/003769.html

[09:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me reads.

[09:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
In practice, H.264 has been used so widely for so many years by so many companies that any patent-holders would have been flushed out by now.

[09:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even if they haven't been, then you'd expect them to join the MPEG-LA, not sue random companies licensing H.264.

[09:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
So it's pretty safe.

[09:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Theora is hopefully safe, but it hasn't had the same level of exposure.

[09:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If Google goes a few more years without getting sued, it will look a lot more promising.

[09:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The email makes a convincing case.  The fact that he framed it in terms of incentives makes it more believable to me.

[09:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's typical of him.  The "being extremely convincing and well-thought-out" thing, I mean.

[09:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can tell you from personal experience that it is a terrible idea to argue with Greg Maxwell about anything.  You will not only lose, you will lose *horribly*.

[09:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(he's involved in Wikipedia too)

[09:12:03.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, the MPEG-LA focusses on software patents, which are frivolous, and should never be patented.

[09:12:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hehe.

[09:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
it just sucks that we have such broken patent systems around the world that permit software patents, either explicitly or through loop holes

[09:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Yeah, but Aryeh's point about them not being a "patent troll" per se is still valid.  That's generally reserved for non-practicing patent-holding entities.

[09:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, I'm not arguing against that. I know MPEG-LA aren't patent trolls

[09:13:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, it's not just software patents, it's lots of types of patents.  Most if not all are believed to be legitimate under current law.  That law should be changed, yes, but that doesn't make the patent suits frivolous.  A frivolous lawsuit is one that clearly has no basis in law, not one that has a basis in law you don't like.

[09:13:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Kk.  Well, I agree with you, then.

[09:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, if that's what you meant by frivolous, then fair enough

[09:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Greg Maxwell is still technically Chief Research Coordinator at Wikimedia: http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Chief_Research_Coordinator

[09:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although I think the role is meaningless.

[09:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(predating the time when Wikimedia had a substantial number of actual employees)

[11:44:00.0000] <paul_irish>
Philip`: how did you come across the obfuscation methods in your font optimizer?

[11:45:00.0000] <paul_irish>
me and ethan of fontsquirrel were just discussing them. really excellent.

[11:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
paul_irish: I just tried deleting random stuff until finding that browsers rejected them and then went back a step and tried again

[11:49:00.0000] <paul_irish>
that's excellent. can you summarize what the POST table changes you make are?

[11:49:01.0000] <paul_irish>
ethan seemed to think this would conflict with the OTS sanitizing/security stuff that Chrome is doing.

[11:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
paul_irish: They're just http://bitbucket.org/philip/font-optimizer/src/tip/obfuscate-font.pl#cl-76

[11:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
i.e. keeping some minimum length, setting everything to 0, but setting the version field to 1 because otherwise Chrome didn't like it

[11:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's quite possible that Chrome might become stricter and reject it)

[11:53:00.0000] <paul_irish>
cool. i'm going to attempt to write up these obfuscations up as a spec of sorts.. with the goal of foundries agreeing to license their work if implementers agree to this sort of level of protection.

[11:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
(since it's probably totally invalid - the goal was to be invalid enough that e.g. Windows wouldn't let you install or view the font, but that it would still work in all the browsers I could test)

[11:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
(If I remember correctly, it does break the font installation on Windows and OS X)

[11:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
(though obviously it's totally trivial for a tool to fix the font and make it readable again)

[11:55:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's a really groovy idea Philip`, paul_irish nice work :)

[11:55:02.0000] <paul_irish>
totally. Ethan actually had a variation of the name table technique, where he uses a unicode smiley face as the Name (instead of empty string).. this prevents installation on Mac

[11:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
(It's a disgusting evil standards-violating hack, but that's okay)

[11:58:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I like evil hacks.

[12:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I guess you'd need some kind of statement from microsoft that they won't make their font importer start supporting those files

[14:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, the font thing sounds bad (corrupting the files and assuming the OS will never support the coruppted file but browsers always will)

[14:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg01830.html - hmmm

[14:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder if i should send an email saying "hi there, we're implementing complete.html#websocket over here"

[14:21:00.0000] <franksalim>
zcorpan, I think that information would be appreciated

[14:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
done

[14:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i hope webkit and mozilla are also tracking the latest version

[14:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Mozilla said they were holding off shipping anything untill it stabilised

[14:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[14:29:01.0000] <zcorpan>
but they're not holding off implementation work, or are they?

[14:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: Chrome has already shipped WebSocket, for the next Safari I am not sure whether we will disable it, and we're actively updating trunk to the latest version

[14:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
as in, there's patches in progress

[14:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: ok, thanks

[14:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: any news on URL/url?

[14:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: I have not done anything related to it

[14:32:02.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[14:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/04/websockets-in-firefox/

[14:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham, zcorpan: in any case I think -76 is a big improvement over -75 in terms of security and ease of implementation for combo http/websocket servers

[14:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Yeah. I'm not sure what the big problems with the WHATWG version are supposed to be, and whether they are real or not

[14:40:01.0000] <gregw>
I think -76 has some good ease of implementation improvements, but I'm very dubious about the new handshake 

[14:40:02.0000] <gregw>
it does not work well with HTTP servers

[14:40:03.0000] <zcorpan>
gregw: what part doesn't work well?

[14:40:04.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: how is it a problem for HTTP servers? or rather, how is it more of a problem than the -75 version?

[14:41:00.0000] <gregw>
because of the non content data after the requests

[14:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
gregw: The random bytes?

[14:42:00.0000] <gregw>
the IETF WG really wants the handshake to be HTTP compliant until the 101 is sent

[14:42:01.0000] <gregw>
those bytes break that

[14:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: aren't those bytes effectively just a message body?

[14:42:03.0000] <jgraham>
Shouldn't the server have done the handoff to the WebSockets specific code by that point? (or treat them like a body)

[14:42:04.0000] <gregw>
they would be if there was a content length

[14:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think Content-Length is required to send a request body

[14:43:01.0000] <gregw>
It is in a persistent connection.

[14:43:02.0000] <zcorpan>
iirc Hixie argued that the random bytes are content after the upgrade

[14:43:03.0000] <gregw>
and if we are HTTP complient other status codes might get sent back - like a 401 for authentication

[14:44:00.0000] <gregw>
zcorpan:  no he wants them to not be content

[14:44:01.0000] <gregw>
so they break HTTP servers... so they can't be "tricked" into doing a handshake

[14:44:02.0000] <jgraham>
gregw: Are there examples of HTTP servers that cannot implement WebSockets due to this design

[14:44:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the WebSocket connection can't be used as a persistent HTTP connection

[14:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so Content-Length is not required

[14:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that being said, if it was added, would that address your objection?

[14:45:02.0000] <gregw>
sure - but then you might as well make it a header

[14:45:03.0000] <gregw>
simpler to implement

[14:45:04.0000] <gregw>
and I'm not sure that 101 can have a body

[14:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
these bytes are in the request, not the response

[14:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
any request can have a body (other than GET or HEAD) IIRC

[14:46:02.0000] <gregw>
there are more in the response

[14:46:03.0000] <gregw>
but actually the response ones are OK

[14:46:04.0000] <gregw>
as they are after the 101

[14:46:05.0000] <gregw>
so yeh - if the request ones can be made legal HTTP then I'm happy

[14:46:06.0000] <othermaciej>
so it sounds to me like nothing here breaks HTTP before the 101 response is sent

[14:47:00.0000] <gregw>
but I still think they are a little bit overkill

[14:47:01.0000] <gregw>
it does if you send something other than the 101

[14:47:02.0000] <gregw>
like a 401

[14:47:03.0000] <gregw>
or a 500

[14:47:04.0000] <gregw>
etc

[14:47:05.0000] <othermaciej>
what breaks http in that case?

[14:47:06.0000] <gregw>
the random bytes will be a bad request

[14:48:00.0000] <gregw>
unless they are content of the request

[14:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the client doesn't send a 401 though

[14:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the client doesn't know whether it will get a 401

[14:48:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so that can't possibly affect what is a valid http request

[14:48:04.0000] <gregw>
OK - let's flip this around... what's the problem with making it a completely legal HTTP request?

[14:48:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe it already is a completely legal HTTP request

[14:49:00.0000] <gregw>
It is, but the random bytes break the next request in the connection

[14:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if it isn't one, I would consider that a bug

[14:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but there won't be a next request in the connection

[14:49:03.0000] <gregw>
there can be if a 401 is sent

[14:49:04.0000] <zcorpan>
i thought the random bytes were there to make it harder to do a cross protocol attack or so

[14:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
the whole point of the first 8 bytes from the client after the upgrade is to make intermediaries who aren't goign to support websocket fail early

[14:49:06.0000] <gregw>
the random bytes work just as well in a header

[14:49:07.0000] <Hixie>
not for the purpose of breaking intermediaries

[14:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Are clients already epected to deal with arbitary HTTP responses?

[14:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: in the case of a 401, the client has to close the connection

[14:50:02.0000] <gregw>
no

[14:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[14:50:04.0000] <gregw>
my no was to jgraham

[14:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the client is not allowed per spec to send another http request down the same connection that was used for an attempted WebSocket upgrade

[14:51:01.0000] <gregw>
but there is a reasonable level of support in the IETF WG to have that as an option

[14:51:02.0000] <gregw>
and those bytes make that impossible for little clear benefit

[14:51:03.0000] <gregw>
othermaciej:  why not - that is not compliant HTTP

[14:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what do you mean?

[14:52:01.0000] <gregw>
the whole point is that before the 101, the connection is-a HTTP request

[14:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the client can close its connection at any time

[14:52:03.0000] <gregw>
so if client and server agree to use it as a persistent HTTP connection, they can do so

[14:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
the client is never an http client, it's a websocket client. From the client's perspective, it's always a WebSocket connection.

[14:52:05.0000] <othermaciej>
tell me what HTTP conformance requirement is violated by closing the connection in response to a 401 (or any non-101 response)

[14:52:06.0000] <Hixie>
It's only the server who thinks it's HTTP

[14:52:07.0000] <gregw>
well you client might be, but there are other clients

[14:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
an HTTP client isn't going to try to upgrade to WebSocket

[14:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
and so there's no problem there either

[14:53:02.0000] <gregw>
there is the use-case that you want to try to do the upgrade, but also request some real content

[14:53:03.0000] <gregw>
so that if you can upgrade you do, if you can't you send some real content

[14:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
no, there isn't

[14:53:05.0000] <gregw>
and avoid another RTT

[14:53:06.0000] <Hixie>
no browser is ever going to do that

[14:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
neither the client protocol nor the JS client API support that use case

[14:54:01.0000] <gregw>
that is what the SPDY guys are interested in

[14:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
the SPDY guys aren't using websocket

[14:54:03.0000] <othermaciej>
if you want to propose it, go ahead, but "I want a new feature" is very different from "this breaks HTTP"

[14:54:04.0000] <gregw>
not yet

[14:54:05.0000] <Hixie>
the SPDY guys are never going to use websocket -- websocket is a completely inappropriate protocol for their use case

[14:54:06.0000] <gregw>
anyway, we've had this debate before... I really am just saying that a lot of -76 is well accepted, but some parts are still being debated

[14:54:07.0000] <othermaciej>
running SPDY over WebSocket would be silly

[14:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: do you believe -76 has less consensus than -75?

[14:55:01.0000] <gregw>
I think that lots of -76 has consensus, but that parts do not

[14:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that doesn't answer my question

[14:55:03.0000] <gregw>
why would running SPDY over websocket be silly? there is interest on the EITF WG list

[14:56:00.0000] <gregw>
-75 has consensus in as much as it reflects the implementations currently shipping

[14:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
because SPDY doesn't need or want an additional framing layer

[14:56:02.0000] <gregw>
I think we all accept there are problems

[14:56:03.0000] <gregw>
but it has a framing layer

[14:56:04.0000] <othermaciej>
the only implementation shipping -75 is Chrome and it's in the process of being rewritten to -76

[14:56:05.0000] <gregw>
so why are we inventing 2 new framing layers that go over HTTP intermediaries

[14:56:06.0000] <gregw>
surely it would be best to come up with only 1

[14:56:07.0000] <franksalim>
SPDY is not intended to go over HTTP intermediaries

[14:56:08.0000] <gregw>
othermaciej:  have a read of the list of impls on wikipedia

[14:57:00.0000] <gregw>
there are 10s

[14:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: the non-browser impls can be upgraded much more readily than browsers, but that being said, has any of those implementors said they prefer -75 to -76?

[14:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
gregw: There are many server side implementations. But they are worthless without clients

[14:58:00.0000] <gregw>
well the IETF WG is pretty clear that HTTP compliance is a requirement - I guess it is debatable if -76 meets that or not

[14:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
given that it takes about 4 hours to write a server-side implementation, i'm not surprised there are a lot of them

[14:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[14:58:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm pretty sure all the client implementations listed in Wikipedia are going to upgrade to -76

[14:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
-76 definitely does not meet the HTTP compliance requirement any *less* than -75

[14:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i mean, i've written at least 3 myself)

[14:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it definitely meets it more, and arguably meets it completely

[14:59:03.0000] <gregw>
Hixie:  so are impls less important that clients? 

[14:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
the HTTP compliance requirement isn't even a goal, IMHO.

[14:59:05.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: server impls are far less important than clients, yes

[15:00:00.0000] <gregw>
obviously not here... but it is in the IETF WG

[15:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm in the IETF WG

[15:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
as is maciej

[15:00:03.0000] <gregw>
anyway... I'm obviously not making my point here

[15:00:04.0000] <gregw>
so I'll leave you be

[15:00:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure what's better about -75 than -76

[15:00:06.0000] <gregw>
no random bytes outside of the request

[15:00:07.0000] <gregw>
put them in a header and it would be a lot better

[15:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if it contains an actual regression on any requirement relative to -75, then I would see why you might not want to start with it

[15:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't recall a requirement that the handshake request must not have a body

[15:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
certainly that's not required for the "http compliance" requirement

[15:02:01.0000] <gregw>
I'm cool if they are a legal body

[15:02:02.0000] <gregw>
but they are not

[15:02:03.0000] <othermaciej>
-75 also blatantly doesn't meet that requirement

[15:02:04.0000] <jgraham>
/me would still like examples of actual deployed HTTP servers that cannot cope with -76

[15:02:05.0000] <othermaciej>
why are they not a legal body?

[15:02:06.0000] <Hixie>
per HTTP, the eight bytes the client send are the first eight bytes of a second pipelined request

[15:02:07.0000] <othermaciej>
can you point to a specific conformance requirement in the HTTP RFC that they violate?

[15:02:08.0000] <Hixie>
that's intentional, the whole point is to break intermediaries who don't know websocket

[15:03:00.0000] <gregw>
jgraham:  it is more about being able to handle non 101 responses.  OK currently implemented, but there is interest in 401, 302's etc

[15:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: so HTTP doesn't allow a request body without Content-Length?

[15:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
not for GET iirc

[15:03:03.0000] <gregw>
Hixie:  +1

[15:03:04.0000] <othermaciej>
the WebSocket request is a GET?

[15:03:05.0000] <othermaciej>
(it doesn't allow a body at all for GET)

[15:03:06.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[15:03:07.0000] <Hixie>
yes it does

[15:03:08.0000] <Hixie>
you can set Content-LEngth with a GET

[15:03:09.0000] <gregw>
and thus needs a content-length or chunking to have a body

[15:03:10.0000] <Hixie>
(but nobody does it)

[15:03:11.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[15:03:12.0000] <othermaciej>
would sending a Content-Length be a problem?

[15:03:13.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: no the whole POINT is to cause the intermediaries to fail

[15:03:14.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yes, cos then intermediaries wouldn't fail

[15:04:00.0000] <gregw>
it might cause some intermediaries to fail sometimes

[15:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
from the point of view of the client, it's not HTTP at all, it's websocket the whole time

[15:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: do we have data showing that this makes unaware intermediaries fail early?

[15:04:03.0000] <gregw>
they will fail anyway becuause Upgrade is hop by hop

[15:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
from the point of view of an HTTP server, it's an HTTP request followed by a bogus request

[15:04:05.0000] <gregw>
if the intermediary does not know about websocket, it will not forward the upgrade

[15:04:06.0000] <othermaciej>
(more so than anything else in the handshake)?

[15:04:07.0000] <Hixie>
from the point of view of a WebSocket server, it's a WebSocket request

[15:04:08.0000] <gregw>
unless it is a dumb byte copier

[15:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not sure what the advantage is of adding the full complexity of HTTP to WebSockets rather than doing it at the application layer

[15:05:01.0000] <gregw>
in which case the random bytes will be copied

[15:05:02.0000] <gregw>
jgraham:  I'm not advocating that

[15:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
from the point of view of an HTTP+WebSocket server, it's an HTTP request followed by the remainder of the data of what was actually a WebSocket request

[15:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm aware of at least one intermediary that failed because of this, but i don't have non-anecdotal data yet

[15:05:05.0000] <gregw>
Hixie:  but if you send weboscket data before the 101, then you are not HTTP compliant

[15:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: intermediaries don't follow the spec, they pass upgrades through unmodified

[15:06:01.0000] <gregw>
it is a HTTP connection until the 101 is sent

[15:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I guess non-anecdotal data would be what we need to determine if this mechanism is effective for its purpose

[15:06:03.0000] <gregw>
if intermediaries pass the upgrade unchanged, then they will probaby copy the bytes as well

[15:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: we have data showing that without this, the handshake "succeeds" in some double-digit number of cases but the first frame sent fails to make it through

[15:06:05.0000] <jgraham>
gregw: Allowing arbitary response codes seems like more complexity. Maybe not the full comlexity of HTTP

[15:06:06.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: which is basically what this handshake does now

[15:06:07.0000] <gregw>
or just make it legal HTTP as the IETF wants

[15:07:00.0000] <gregw>
jgraham:  that's only for consenting clients/servers. it is not a MUST requirement

[15:07:01.0000] <john_fallows>
if you want HTTP intermediaries to fail during the handshake request, why not use POST instead of GET and omit the Content-Length header, that would very likely trigger a 411 Length Required

[15:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: would it cause a problem to send the random bytes after the "successful" 101 response?

[15:07:03.0000] <gregw>
jgraham:  but if a client and server want to use BASIC or DIGEST auth, then why not let them use it?

[15:07:04.0000] <jgraham>
gregw: Consenting serves, yes. I don't see how any client could avoid it

[15:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
john_fallows: that's a neat idea

[15:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: argument from authority has no effect here (invoking the IETF's name won't win you the argument)

[15:08:02.0000] <gregw>
jgraham:  there is no need to follow a 401

[15:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: especially since we are part of the IETF WG

[15:08:04.0000] <gregw>
it's just that the server will only allow clients that do connect

[15:08:05.0000] <othermaciej>
argument from authority shouldn't win in the IETF either

[15:08:06.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it doubles the RTT for the handshake

[15:08:07.0000] <jgraham>
gregw: That's the same as saying "all clients need to implement it"

[15:08:08.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: what about john_fallows's POST idea?

[15:09:00.0000] <gregw>
jgraham:  well all the browsers have it already... so it's not a big deal

[15:09:01.0000] <gregw>
othermaciej:  that is still illegal HTTP

[15:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i don't think it would make a difference -- intermediaries appear to be pretty HTTP-stupid. But I'm happy to change it to POST if that makes people happier.

[15:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: but i don't think it'd make gregw happier

[15:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: would it be technically legal HTTP?

[15:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
gregw: I am unconvinced it is that simple, but have no experience with implementing a client

[15:10:02.0000] <gregw>
Hixie:  true.  I think it should be HTTP legal until the 101 is received

[15:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: off-hand, no idea

[15:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I can't find any requirement to send Content-Length in a request

[15:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I need to read the HTTP RFC more carefully

[15:11:02.0000] <gregw>
without something to indicate the content length, it is not legal

[15:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: or if you have a cite for what conformance requirement is violated, that would help

[15:11:04.0000] <zcorpan>
are there other ways to make intermediaries fail while being legal http?

[15:11:05.0000] <othermaciej>
ah:

[15:11:06.0000] <gregw>
othermaciej:  you need to look at RFC2616 in the section about marking body ends

[15:11:07.0000] <othermaciej>
"For compatibility with HTTP/1.0 applications, HTTP/1.1 requests containing a message-body MUST include a valid Content-Length header field unless the server is known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant."

[15:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
"The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in the request's message-headers."

[15:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: part of the reason you're not convincing me is that you're just saying "you can't do X" without giving me an alternative way of achieving the effect I'm attempting to achieve.

[15:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that's not a conformance requirement (and doesn't seem to quite match the server requirements)

[15:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: so you just feel like stop energy, you don't seem to be helping.

[15:13:03.0000] <gregw>
Hixie:  true, but I don't think your solution works anyway, and I don't think it is actually possible

[15:13:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: oh, good point

[15:13:05.0000] <gregw>
intermediairies will either be good or they will be stupid byte copiers

[15:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
however, what I quoted is a MUST-level requirement for HTTP 1.1 clients

[15:14:01.0000] <gregw>
your proposal does not help with the later and is not needed for the former

[15:14:02.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: so if the server is known to be compliant, that MUST doesn't apply

[15:14:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: could the random content bytes piggyback on the packet for the first client message?

[15:14:04.0000] <gregw>
zcorpan:  but then it is either a content length or chunking

[15:14:05.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: right - though connecting to a random server, you have no way to know

[15:14:06.0000] <gregw>
let me find the section....

[15:14:07.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: evidence does not bear this out

[15:15:00.0000] <gregw>
Hixie:  then please publish the evidence

[15:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: at least in section 4.4 Message Length, there doesn't seem to be a requirement to that effect

[15:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: we have double-digit-percentage numbers of connections in the test who passed through the Upgrade, but did not pass through the first frame

[15:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: the data was sent to the hybi list

[15:15:04.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: right, but it seems reasonable to assume that a server that supports websockets isn't going to be an http/1.0 application

[15:15:05.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.4

[15:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: yes, but when JS in the browser initiates the connection, the browser doesn't know if the server actually supports websockets

[15:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: in fact the design of the handshake is set up so the browser can find out with good confidence whether the server does in fact support webscocket

[15:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: (the client in that case is a websocket client, so it isn't bound to HTTP rules)

[15:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: indeed, except to the extent one accepts the requirement that servers should observe what looks like valid HTTP until they respond with a 101

[15:17:01.0000] <gregw>
Hixie:  so you can make the first message of the websocket connect a check message

[15:17:02.0000] <gregw>
if a message is not quickly received, then the upgrade did not work

[15:17:03.0000] <gregw>
and you have fail fast

[15:18:00.0000] <gregw>
the first message can be an application message if one is available, or some kind of noop ping

[15:18:01.0000] <gregw>
there is already talk about keep-alives and pings

[15:18:02.0000] <gregw>
so just send one immediately if there is no application message

[15:19:00.0000] <gregw>
that also separates out the attack protection mechanism (the random bytes) from the fast fail mechanism

[15:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: well HTTP 1.1 servers can assume they are HTTP 1.1, so the 1.0 requirement doesn't apply

[15:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: how can you do that without requiring an extra RTT?

[15:20:00.0000] <gregw>
well if you have an application message, you send that just as you would anyway

[15:20:01.0000] <gregw>
if you don't then send a ping

[15:20:02.0000] <gregw>
ok so the fail fast is not as fast

[15:20:03.0000] <gregw>
the failure has one more RTT

[15:20:04.0000] <gregw>
but that's only for failures

[15:20:05.0000] <Hixie>
that makes the client behaviour depnd on JS execution speed, which is an interop nightmare

[15:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd much rather do what we're doing now

[15:21:01.0000] <gregw>
no - the browser can send a ping immediately the 101 is received

[15:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
wait, that won't work anyway

[15:21:03.0000] <gregw>
but what you are doing now is breaking HTTP and will cause all sorts of future problems

[15:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
the whole point is the API doesn't say it's connected until it's connected

[15:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we require a ping first, then there's an extra RTT before we're connected

[15:22:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't like adding more latency to the handshake

[15:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's a terrible solution

[15:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
we're

[15:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
not

[15:22:05.0000] <Hixie>
breaking

[15:22:06.0000] <Hixie>
HTTP

[15:22:07.0000] <Hixie>
this isn't HTTP

[15:22:08.0000] <gregw>
it is until the 101 is sent

[15:22:09.0000] <Hixie>
no, it's not

[15:22:10.0000] <Hixie>
that's BS

[15:22:11.0000] <Hixie>
plus, even if it was, as maciej has pointed out, it's not actually invalid

[15:23:00.0000] <gregw>
you need to have a content length or chunking or one of the self limiting content types to have a content body

[15:23:01.0000] <gregw>
or you can close the connection... but that's not useful for a request

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
quote the spec that says that

[15:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
please

[15:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
cite the MUST requirement

[15:24:03.0000] <gregw>
in section 4.4

[15:24:04.0000] <gregw>
there are only 5 ways

[15:24:05.0000] <Hixie>
paste the sentence

[15:24:06.0000] <gregw>
and 1 does not apply, nor does 5

[15:24:07.0000] <gregw>
so you are left with 2, 3 or 4

[15:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
4.4 is all server requirements

[15:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
except for the HTTP 1.0 compat requirement maciej pasted

[15:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
which as noted isn't relevant here

[15:25:03.0000] <gregw>
no it is for any HTTP message

[15:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's about how to receive the message

[15:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
which in the case of a client-sent message, is a server-side requirement

[15:26:02.0000] <gregw>
it's a HTTP message requirement

[15:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
no, it's not

[15:27:01.0000] <gregw>
and the random bytes will break a HTTP connection if the upgrade is not accepted

[15:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's no HTTP connection in that case

[15:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
the client will abort regardless of the response

[15:27:04.0000] <gregw>
why?

[15:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
because the websocket spec requires it to

[15:28:00.0000] <gregw>
but you are not in websockets! the upgrade faile

[15:28:01.0000] <gregw>
but you are not in websockets! the upgrade failed

[15:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
if you're not a websocket client, then you didn't send an upgrade request or the 8 random bytes

[15:28:03.0000] <zcorpan>
gregw: the client is always in websockets

[15:28:04.0000] <gregw>
so you have a valid HTTP connection that should be able to be used without requirement for another RTT

[15:29:00.0000] <gregw>
you might be a client that can be websocket or can be something else

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
the connection itself isn't HTTP or WebSockets or whatnot. That's a meaningless abstraction.

[15:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's just bytes

[15:29:03.0000] <gregw>
so it tries the upgrade, and if that does not work, keeps using HTTP

[15:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
what matters is what the peers think is going on

[15:29:05.0000] <Hixie>
there is no way to try an upgrade and continue using HTTP

[15:29:06.0000] <gregw>
so you are going to require and extra RTT for all the apps that can't use Websocket

[15:29:07.0000] <Hixie>
that's a violation of the websocket protocol

[15:29:08.0000] <gregw>
just so they can try to use it

[15:29:09.0000] <gregw>
but until the 101, you are not in websockets

[15:29:10.0000] <Hixie>
there's no other way to use the API

[15:29:11.0000] <gregw>
you are in HTTP

[15:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
the client is NEVER in HTTP

[15:30:01.0000] <gregw>
there are other clients than JS

[15:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
those clients should use TCP

[15:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
websockets is irrelevant to those clients

[15:30:04.0000] <gregw>
well that's not what is happening out there

[15:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
those clients do not need to send the 8 bytes

[15:30:06.0000] <Hixie>
they can do whatever they want to upgrade the server

[15:30:07.0000] <gregw>
some of them are called browsers!

[15:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
you are not making any sense here

[15:31:01.0000] <gregw>
well that's a winning argument

[15:31:02.0000] <gregw>
l8r

[15:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
FWIW it seems likely to me that non-browser clients for websockets will be used

[15:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Wouldn't they just connect directly with tcp without going via http?

[15:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
Because there is value in interacting with the websocket ecosystem outside the browser

[15:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Connect to what?

[15:36:03.0000] <jgraham>
Assume some service is provided over websockets for browsers

[15:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
And someone wants to develop a custom non-browser app that connets to exactly the same service

[15:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
then they couldn't use a general-purpose http client to talk to that service

[15:45:00.0000] <gregw>
but they want to be able to tunnel bidirectional communication through a HTTP infrastructure (eg firewalls, proxies and intermediaries)

[15:45:01.0000] <gregw>
plus browsers themselves might want to do websocket extensions

[15:46:00.0000] <gregw>
so the "can't do it in JS, so can't do it at all" argument is not that valid

[15:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not suggesting a non-browser-client would be a general purpose HTTP client

[15:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
It would be custom websockets code

[15:46:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I agree that this seems likely

[15:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
(this is why I would like the client side to be relatively simple to implement)

[15:47:01.0000] <gregw>
jgraham:  I don't anybody disagrees with that

[15:48:00.0000] <gregw>
but that is not to say that we cannot have optional less simple solutions as well

[15:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm somewhat more willing to impose client-side complexity, because at least browser-hosted clients have to do what it takes to ensure security against cross-protocol attacks

[15:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
gregw: I don't really believe in optional features

[15:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: agreed that complexity for security is well justified

[15:50:00.0000] <gregw>
jgraham:  but that says that websocket has to have an authentication system that will keep everybody happy for all the time

[15:50:01.0000] <gregw>
and compression that will last forever

[15:50:02.0000] <gregw>
jgraham:  but I agree that options have to be carefully thought out so they are not by default mandatory

[15:52:00.0000] <gregw>
but as a lot of websocket connections are going to be established from well featured HTTP clients to well featured HTTP servers, it seams very very strange to not let them use features like authentication

[15:52:01.0000] <gregw>
if they both wish

[15:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
I don't think it is bad to allow for the possibility of future expansion 

[15:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
I do think it is bad to have explicitly optional features

[15:56:02.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway bedtime

[15:56:03.0000] <jgraham>
gn

[15:56:04.0000] <zcorpan>
nn jgraham

[15:56:05.0000] <gregw>
jgraham:  guess I can agree with that.... which is why keeping the HTTP legal is good for future proofing

[16:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
does anyone know of any places that depend on the components for html5 bugs?

[16:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
so far i have:

[16:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
 - bugs link on http://xn--74h.damowmow.com/

[16:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
 - script that updates http://www.whatwg.org/issues/data.html?period=1

[16:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
 - bug report form on the spec (file-bug.cgi)

[16:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
 - various spec headers:

[16:59:05.0000] <Hixie>
(6 files)

[16:59:06.0000] <Hixie>
and some stuff i use personally


2010-05-04
[17:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
   text      := <any Unicode text other than cr or lf>

[17:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: shouldn't that be any Unicode text other than cr, lf, < or &?

[17:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: HTML WG home page

[17:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: yeah

[17:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: k

[17:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
waaaaah, ArrrrrrrrrrryehGregorrrrrrrr, the wiki brokeded!

[17:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
it won't let me edit!

[17:20:00.0000] <erlehmann>
cue "i made you a wiki. but i eated it."

[17:20:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: it means it's time to move from wiki land to spec land :)

[17:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, guess so

[17:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
man

[17:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
i was trying to put that off more

[17:20:05.0000] <erlehmann>
and thus the standard was born.

[17:20:06.0000] <Hixie>
as soon as i start writing spec text, the honeymoon is over and people start bitching at me instead of at each otehr

[17:22:00.0000] <erlehmann>
hixie, the lightning rod of the open web

[17:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: why the alignment difference for subtitles and captions?

[17:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
matches existing practice

[17:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: yt?

[17:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: yt?

[17:24:02.0000] <nessy>
in a meeting - will be with you in about 30 min

[17:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[17:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i think lang="" is bad because it sets the language of the element and comes with xml:lang confusion baggage

[17:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i think hreflang="" is confusing since there's no href=""

[17:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Isn't it supposed to set the language of the element?

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, why is setting the language of the element bad?

[17:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
because the element doesn't contain any text

[17:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
label="" is text

[17:34:02.0000] <zcorpan>
true

[17:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
would xml:lang be used in xhtml?

[17:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
presumably

[17:35:02.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[17:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
though i agree that'd be a bit of a pain

[17:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
i can live with srclang=""

[17:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
is websrt intended for all kind=""s?

[17:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[17:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[17:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
do we want <track enabled=false> or <track default=off> or <track force=disabled> or something else? (i think we need a three-state default state attribute to allow sites who have offered user preferences to force which titles are enabled by default)

[17:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
enabled=true/false default=on/off force=enabled/disabled state=show/hide

[17:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
(third state is missing attribute)

[17:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
setting the attribute dynamically has no effect

[17:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's only to set the default state

[17:41:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
force=enabled/disabled

[17:41:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
makes it clear that you're overriding a default, which isn't obvious from several of the others

[17:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
force is a verb, though, which is unusual for us

[17:41:05.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't like force

[17:41:06.0000] <Hixie>
default=enabled/disabled ?

[17:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it sounds forceful :)

[17:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
default=show/hide ?

[17:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
hm... show/hide may be misleading since some of these, when enabled, don't display any UI

[17:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. the metadata tracks

[17:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
they default to off

[17:42:05.0000] <Hixie>
but would be turned on by this

[17:42:06.0000] <Hixie>
and wouldn't show anything, just fire events

[17:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
enabled=forceon/forceoff

[17:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
spellcheck and draggable and contenteditable are true/false

[17:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
enabled sounds like disabled which is a boolean attribute

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
we don't seem to have any attributes equivalent to this so far

[17:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[17:48:02.0000] <zcorpan>
<option> has selected and disabled

[17:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
selected="" is similar (disabled="" isn't) but it's not two-state

[17:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
checked="" is similar

[17:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
state=on/off

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
"state" and "default" are too vague really

[17:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I fear attributes that sound like you're *supposed* to use them.

[17:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe the solution is to not provide a way to enable/disable a track from markup

[17:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
and require using JS

[17:54:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't have a problem with that.  The only reason you want to override the user defaults is if you're doing something yourself in script.

[17:54:03.0000] <gregw>
Hixie: with the experiment for connections through intermediaries, do you know if the intermediaries that didn't send the first packet client to server, would or would not send the first packet server to client

[17:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: yeah

[17:55:01.0000] <gregw>
ie do you know if random bytes after the 101 response would be enough for the fail fast

[17:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: Hixie's previous comments were that he didn't have non-anecdotal data on that (yet)

[17:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
gregw: all i know is that after the handshake completed, data couldn't successfully be sent using websocket. I don't know precisely how it failed.

[17:57:00.0000] <gregw>
ok - well that leaves the possibility that something sent after the 101 response could detect fail fast and still not interfer with HTTP.

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
my requirement is that the connection be proven to work by the time the API sends the connected event, and that that happen in as short a time as possible

[17:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
ideally instantaneously

[17:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't been able to find a way to pring it to lower than 1xRTT

[17:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
2xRTT seems longer than desired

[17:58:04.0000] <gregw>
I think that could be done with just the bytes after the 101 response

[17:58:05.0000] <gregw>
they can be sent in the same packet

[17:59:00.0000] <gregw>
and the handshake on the client would check for them

[17:59:01.0000] <gregw>
and the connection would only be open if they are there and correct

[17:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
if that works, yeah

[17:59:03.0000] <gregw>
so we need data

[18:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
we need data either way, idneed

[18:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: is there a need for <source> in <track>?

[18:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes, to the same extent as there is a need for a <source> in <video>, no?

[18:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
not if everyone agrees to implement websrt

[18:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
<source> is complex and a source of many bugs

[18:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
no pun intended

[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm happy to start off without <source> and only add it when people whine

[18:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that means it's your job to make people not whine enough that i hear it

[18:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i can't make people not whine

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
but you can convince them they're wrong, right?

[18:08:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah, hopefully

[18:12:00.0000] <nessy>
/me is back - reading up

[18:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
would be fun to reverse engineer srt impls

[18:15:01.0000] <zcorpan>
nn

[18:16:00.0000] <nessy>
ok, so something has been published I gather?

[18:17:00.0000] <nessy>
/me also needs to catch up on email, I guess

[18:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: nothing published

[18:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: he was discussing the wiki stuff

[18:19:02.0000] <nessy>
ah cool

[18:19:03.0000] <nessy>
I see

[18:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
though i have begun editing the spec

[18:19:05.0000] <nessy>
you wanted something?

[18:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i was going to ask you if we really needed to support <trackgroup>

[18:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
and if so, what it was solving

[18:20:02.0000] <nessy>
so, there are two things that were a requirement when we designed the <track> element

[18:20:03.0000] <nessy>
one was that we wanted to be able to have multiple tracks active at the same time

[18:21:00.0000] <nessy>
so, for this we would simply have multiple <track> elements inside the <video> element

[18:21:01.0000] <nessy>
then they could all be active at the same time, if the author or user so desired

[18:22:00.0000] <nessy>
the other requirement was to be able to specify that several <track>s are alternatives to each other and only one of a group should be active at one time

[18:22:01.0000] <nessy>
for example if you have text audio descriptions in multiple languages, you would only want one of them to be read out by the screenreader at one point in time

[18:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
is there a use case for multiple sets of mutually exclusive alternatives?

[18:22:03.0000] <nessy>
to specify this, we introduced the <trackgroup>

[18:23:00.0000] <nessy>
then all the <track>s inside the <trackgroup> would work like a radiogroup

[18:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(I guess so if you have both captions and audio descriptions)

[18:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but I'm not sure there is a use case for multiple lists of mutually exclusive alternatives that are all the same type

[18:23:03.0000] <nessy>
yes, othermaciej, you could have multiple captions in different languages, then multiple text audio descriptions in different languages, then multiple subtitles in different languages

[18:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nor for a set of mutually exclusive alternatives plus some free-floating items that are not part of that set

[18:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
again, assuming all are of the same type

[18:24:02.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej, I tend to agree that that is very unlikely

[18:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure what it would mean to have captions in a language and subtitles in a language and to pick both

[18:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
does it make sense to enable both french captions and french subtitles?

[18:25:02.0000] <nessy>
you could have a english subtitle always on and a second subtitle in a different language free for choice

[18:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: oh so it's not about having multiple tracks giving the same data in different formats? (like srt and ttml?)

[18:25:04.0000] <nessy>
well, that, too

[18:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems to be mostly about whether the UI shows mutually exclusive options or independently toggle-able items

[18:26:01.0000] <nessy>
so, in order to deal with all the complexities of different formats, different languages, and different text types, we just made if completely open

[18:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but I'm not sure <trackgroup>+<track> maps very well to the UI use cases

[18:27:00.0000] <nessy>
just specify  what you want active in parallel in multiple <tracks>s and what you want exclusive inside a <trackgroup>

[18:27:01.0000] <nessy>
what UI use cases?

[18:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[18:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
so it seems like there's several things going on here

[18:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
which should be kept separate

[18:27:05.0000] <nessy>
indeed

[18:27:06.0000] <othermaciej>
this markup effectively controls the UI for picking auxiliary tracks (or at least the built-in UI)

[18:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure how to make a pop-up menu that represents a list of radio groups

[18:28:01.0000] <nessy>
yes, it would - so trackgroup provides a submenu

[18:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or whether that will be understandable for common use cases

[18:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
it seems like the UI issue is simply a matter of offering each subtitle track as a mutually exclusive group

[18:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you have submenus you have already failed at creating good UI

[18:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
just saying that they are subtitles automatically solves the problem

[18:29:02.0000] <nessy>
I implemented it here: http://www.annodex.net/~silvia/itext/elephant_no_skin.html

[18:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I also have to admit that I'm not sure I understand the difference between subtitles and captions

[18:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
for the multiple formats issue, zcorpan was suggesting we just not support that

[18:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: captions include descriptions of sound effects

[18:30:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[18:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: captions are useful when the sound is muted; subtitles are useful when you can hear the sound but don't speak the language

[18:30:05.0000] <othermaciej>
is it common to have both? do typical users understand this difference when presented in the UI?

[18:30:06.0000] <Hixie>
it is extremely rare to have both

[18:31:00.0000] <nessy>
anyone who is deaf understands the difference

[18:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but non-deaf people will have to look at this menu

[18:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
most of the time you have subtitles for all languages except the main one, and a caption track for that one

[18:31:03.0000] <nessy>
most others don't care

[18:31:04.0000] <othermaciej>
assuming they watch foreign films

[18:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
often labeled "English for the hard of hearing"

[18:31:06.0000] <nessy>
yup, what Ian said :)

[18:31:07.0000] <othermaciej>
that label would probably be much more clear to people than "Subtitle" vs "Caption"

[18:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
also seems like you want it in a flat menu though

[18:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that's what you get on DVDs anyway

[18:33:00.0000] <nessy>
YouTube only calls them captions

[18:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: was there much demand for supporting multiple formats or was that purely a theoretical thing?

[18:34:00.0000] <nessy>
oh no, that was a discussion that was very keenly held in favor of multiple formats

[18:34:01.0000] <nessy>
in particular for allowing both srt and dfxp

[18:34:02.0000] <nessy>
I think you will be killed if you disallow multiple formats ;)

[18:35:00.0000] <doublec>
that's what they said about video - he's still alive :)

[18:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
we didn't disallow multiple formats

[18:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
for video

[18:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: so people really wanted to ship two different sets of titles for each track?

[18:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: or did they want the option to use one or the other?

[18:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
because those are different use cases

[18:39:00.0000] <nessy>
they wanted the option to use one or the other

[18:39:01.0000] <nessy>
nobody wants to ship multiple formats, I think

[18:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh ok

[18:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
well then

[18:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
no need for multiple <source>s for each <track>

[18:39:05.0000] <nessy>
which is why I gave you the feedback that <source> didn't really solve the problem (did you get the email?)

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
and the people who want to use ttml can work on convincing the UAs that implementing their beast is a good idea

[18:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[18:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
i got the one that says:

[18:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
BTW: did you get my earlier feedback email on your first draft? Was

[18:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
wondering if you got anything out of it.

[18:40:05.0000] <nessy>
yeah, that one :)

[18:40:06.0000] <Hixie>
don't think i got the one before that, unless it was the one entitled "your irc question"

[18:41:00.0000] <nessy>
might have been that one

[18:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[18:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
then i have them in my bucket :-)

[18:41:03.0000] <nessy>
ah, there was another one I think - let me check

[18:42:00.0000] <nessy>
the one titled diverse subtitles stuff

[18:42:01.0000] <annevk>
would be nice if we just had to implement a single captioning/subtitling format

[18:42:02.0000] <nessy>
that was the one that the last one referred to

[18:42:03.0000] <annevk>
WebSRT looks pretty extensible if we do the parsing right

[18:43:00.0000] <annevk>
the wiki throws an internal error?

[18:43:01.0000] <nessy>
annevk: we can try … but if all the fansubbers have to convert their files and all the professional captioners, too, we might not make many friends

[18:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is WebSRT compatible with existing SRT content?

[18:45:00.0000] <nessy>
also, the multiple formats option were a means to keep a door open for future time-aligned text formats and for other formats such as a/v to be specified in the <track>

[18:45:01.0000] <nessy>
in which case <source> makes sense again

[18:45:02.0000] <nessy>
(yeah - can't get to the wiki right now either)

[18:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: if you're around, the wiki is now even more broken :-(

[18:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yes

[18:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: in that existing content will get handled fine

[18:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: don't seem to have that one

[18:49:02.0000] <nessy>
oh really!?

[18:49:03.0000] <nessy>
let me send it again

[18:50:00.0000] <nessy>
hopefully it didn't get spam captured ...

[18:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
foudn it in the spam folder

[18:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
can you send me a third copy to see if it gets past my spam filter?

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
gmail figured the second was part of the first and spammed it too

[18:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it never forwarded to my main account

[18:53:02.0000] <annevk>
nessy, supporting up to fifty subtitling formats in a browser is not really a workable solution imo

[18:53:03.0000] <annevk>
nessy, fun research project maybe on how to do it efficiently, but there is better use of our time

[18:53:04.0000] <nessy>
thought that might have happened :(

[18:53:05.0000] <annevk>
nessy, and conversion is prolly relatively straightforward

[19:03:00.0000] <nessy>
annevk - fifty is indeed overkill - but three is not that bad - after all we support several image and video formats

[19:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
with the exception of chrome, we support one video format

[19:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: got it the third time

[19:10:01.0000] <nessy>
ah good!

[19:11:00.0000] <annevk>
nessy, sure, but I rather we didn't :)

[19:11:01.0000] <annevk>
nessy, we support one styling language, one scripting language, ...

[19:12:00.0000] <nessy>
they are not media formats

[19:12:01.0000] <nessy>
I all for having one baseline format that everyone supports

[19:13:00.0000] <nessy>
but I also think it may be too restrictive to just rely on one

[19:13:01.0000] <nessy>
actually - I think "one scripting language" may not be quite true… but I'm not an expert there

[19:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"one scripting language" is pretty much true except for IE

[19:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
should the default be kind=subtitle or kind=caption?

[19:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess kind=caption

[19:25:00.0000] <annevk>
nessy, well, as someone indicated we can support more in the future

[19:26:00.0000] <annevk>
though I guess that would mean <track> cannot be a void element

[19:26:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[19:26:02.0000] <nessy>
it's also a question of what attributes we give to track, I guess

[19:27:00.0000] <annevk>
but then I also don't quite see subtitles as a media format

[19:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, the [CC] symbol isn't in unicode?

[19:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, checked in a new <track> element. No processing model yet.

[19:37:00.0000] <nessy>
wow, it's all happening!

[19:42:00.0000] <nessy>
I assume when you're ready for input there will be an email thread on the public-html list?

[19:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[19:51:00.0000] <annevk>
where will the WebSRT format be defined?

[19:52:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, the states are not <dfn>d

[19:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
WebSRT in section 4.8.9.10.3, probably

[19:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm good point thanks

[19:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok, dinner, bbiab

[21:14:00.0000] <annevk>
"A HTML5-HTML4 comparison which was as short, dry, accurate and complete as possible would be great."

[21:14:01.0000] <annevk>
ohuh

[21:14:02.0000] <annevk>
reading lots of friendly stuff today

[21:15:00.0000] <annevk>
even an ad hominem attack from Sylvain: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webfonts-wg/2010May/0007.html

[21:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: you kinda brought that one onto yourself :-P

[21:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
though it's unclear what he's talking about

[21:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
since as far as i can tell all that you've talked about is CORS

[21:51:00.0000] <annevk>
oh there's more: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webfonts-wg/2010May/0013.html

[21:52:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems he missed the part where I said "my bad" about bullshit and explained why...

[22:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh crap, i forgot to handle pause-on-exit

[22:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy, AryehGregor: wiki is still down

[22:17:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, are you the author of the peer-to-peer-connection section?

[22:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
insofar as anyone has authored anything there, yeah

[22:19:00.0000] <annevk>
how are embedded timed tracks handled by the way?

[22:19:01.0000] <annevk>
I missed that

[22:20:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, I assume sendText, sendBitmap, and sendFile are reliable (i.e, you won't be missing parts of the image, and the data will be in order.) Do you have any thoughts on the protocol that should be used here?

[22:29:00.0000] <nessy>
annevk: through the same JavaScript API

[22:30:00.0000] <annevk>
ah, just an API, okay

[22:30:01.0000] <annevk>
didn't look at the API yet and since the wiki is down...

[22:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
mcarter: my main thought is that i hope someone else will write it :-)

[22:42:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, how set on this level of abstraction are you? For instance, would you be opposed to an api that combined Text, Bitmap, and File sending into a sendBuffer method, and a set of functions to convert between buffers and files, bitmaps, and text?

[22:53:00.0000] <annevk>
mcarter, it's very experimental

[22:53:01.0000] <annevk>
mcarter, much like the TCPConnection API you fixed ;)

[22:53:02.0000] <annevk>
mcarter, planning on doing it again? :)

[22:54:00.0000] <mcarter>
annevk, heh, I would love to have a peer to peer connection in the browser

[22:55:00.0000] <annevk>
me too

[22:55:01.0000] <mcarter>
I like the idea of pointing at outside specifications for the bulk of the protocol, but I'm a bit nervous because most external protocol specifications are HUGE

[22:55:02.0000] <annevk>
would be nice if we had something simple

[22:56:00.0000] <annevk>
IETF might cry though

[22:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the hard part of p2p is finding the relevant peer

[22:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the second hardest part is connecting to said peer even if you are both behind NAT or firewalls or other unpleasant artifacts of network topology

[22:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the protocol to talk to your peer once you have connected is the easy part

[22:58:01.0000] <mcarter>
othermaciej, ideally we could just use something like STUN for the connection setup

[22:58:02.0000] <mcarter>
othermaciej, as far as finding a relevant peer, I think we can just not specify that for now. Developers can easily write web applications to do that

[22:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
mcarter: any time I hear an implementation proposal involving the word "just", I assume the person making it has vastly underestimated the complexity

[23:00:00.0000] <mcarter>
othermaciej, touch�

[23:01:00.0000] <doublec>
I think the same about 'easily'

[23:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(the people I most often hear "can't you just..." from are security people, though fortunately that happens less often these days)

[23:01:02.0000] <mcarter>
othermaciej, Yes, STUN is big and complicated, and relatively hard to implement, but I really meant "just" as pointing out that we at least don't necessarily have to re-specify that part of a p2p protocol

[23:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
another hard part of this problem: security

[23:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
1) how do you know the person connecting to your socket is your intended peer?

[23:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
2) how do you make the socket listening code robust against attackers throwing garbage at it? now they have a way to push untrusted data into the browser without you even browsing...

[23:03:02.0000] <othermaciej>
3) how do you avoid this being used to build botnets?

[23:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
not to say it's impossible, but I don't think the end result will be something simple

[23:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
gotta run, later folks

[23:04:02.0000] <mcarter>
othermaciej, take care

[23:13:00.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if I am the only one who uses cite="" as a replacement for <a>

[23:14:00.0000] <jwm>
you are

[23:17:00.0000] <annevk>
I suspect Joe Clark and Karl Dubost might be guilty of it as well

[23:20:00.0000] <karlcow>
not exactly I use cite to associate the content of the blockquote with a *uri*, not as a replacement for a. Sometimes in the text, you will find the same uri for linking to the page sometimes not. For example, with cite="urn:isbn:978-2-07-034951-7" 

[23:22:00.0000] <nessy>
what does <cite> give you over <a>?

[23:25:00.0000] <karlcow>
nessy: do you have a content model on how you use a with a blockquote which associates a and the blockquote (and sometimes to a reference which is not an hyperlink)?

[23:25:01.0000] <nessy>
sure, for that use case

[23:26:00.0000] <karlcow>
interested to see which solutions you would recommend.

[23:26:01.0000] <nessy>
what I meant was: when annevk said he would use <cite> instead of <a>, I wondered why - for the simple case where you're linking to a Web page

[23:27:00.0000] <karlcow>
the "a" is inside the "blockquote" or outside?

[23:27:01.0000] <nessy>
either

[23:28:00.0000] <karlcow>
how do we associate the content of the "blockquote" with the "a"

[23:28:01.0000] <nessy>
(btw: I'm not suggesting anything - I'm trying to learn)

[23:28:02.0000] <karlcow>
nessy: yes, understood. 

[23:29:00.0000] <nessy>
if I'm not after associating a blockquote with a hyperlink, then <a> would be sufficient, right?

[23:29:01.0000] <karlcow>
I use cite because I never found a way which was not ambiguous on how associating text of blockquote with a specific uris (knowing in addition that the text can contain sometimes hyperlinks itself.)

[23:30:00.0000] <nessy>
ah I see

[23:30:01.0000] <nessy>
we're talking about the cite attribute and not the cite element?

[23:31:00.0000] <karlcow>
yes cite attribute

[23:31:01.0000] <nessy>
fair enough

[23:31:02.0000] <karlcow>
cite element is another issue ;) but once at a time :)

[23:34:00.0000] <karlcow>
Some use cases I had given when I made a review of xhtml2 in the past, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/2004Feb/0070

[23:35:00.0000] <annevk>
nessy, cite="" over <a>, not <cite>

[23:35:01.0000] <nessy>
yup, got it :)

[23:35:02.0000] <annevk>
example: http://annevankesteren.nl/2010/05/h264-licensing

[23:37:00.0000] <nessy>
damned, I can't click through on the quotes :(

[23:37:01.0000] <nessy>
maybe safari doesn't support the cite attribute?

[23:38:00.0000] <nessy>
ah, it's underneath, sorry - that is really irritating 

[23:39:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh, it's not meant to be good :)

[23:39:01.0000] <annevk>
and that's implemented via JavaScript

[23:39:02.0000] <annevk>
UAs don't really seem to expose it at all :/

[23:40:00.0000] <annevk>
at some point I want to implement it via XBL2

[23:40:01.0000] <nessy>
oh - no wonder I don't find it useful ;)

[23:40:02.0000] <annevk>
create a little popup when you hover the quote

[23:40:03.0000] <nessy>
anyway - I'm now lost reading the articles - thanks!

[23:40:04.0000] <annevk>
oops, maybe shouldn't have used a post on video as example :)

[23:41:00.0000] <nessy>
lol

[23:42:00.0000] <nessy>
I read the earlier blog post of MS, but wasn't yet aware of this new one

[23:42:01.0000] <nessy>
too much client work in the last week...

[23:50:00.0000] <roc>
annevk: I think what Dean is saying is that third-party apps that use Windows codecs are "covered" by Microsoft's license ... but they still have to abide by the limits of that license

[23:50:01.0000] <roc>
or something like that

[23:51:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, I figured

[23:52:00.0000] <annevk>
he just didn't say anything about developers and paying

[23:52:01.0000] <annevk>
which was the key point

[00:01:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, hey TabAtkins__ joined the WebFonts WG

[00:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Yus.

[00:01:02.0000] <annevk>
gonna help me out?

[00:01:03.0000] <annevk>
just pointed out you guys don't do CORS: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2010AprJun/0015.html

[00:01:04.0000] <TabAtkins__>
I had meant to join it when it formed, but it got lost in the move and affiliations change.

[00:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins__>
We don't?  Interesting.  I'll see if I can talk to the guys that did fonts this week.

[00:11:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: here now

[00:54:00.0000] <foolip>
ok, I see the issue was <trackgroup>

[00:56:00.0000] <foolip>
I think we want to make it as trivial as possible to handle the typical multi-language subtitle case, i.e. mutually exclusive <track>s

[00:57:00.0000] <foolip>
still, allowing for parallell tracks of some kinds seems reasonable.

[00:57:01.0000] <foolip>
if there's a less intrusive way I'd like that, I'm not particularly attached to <trackgroup>

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: k

[01:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
good evening

[01:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh cool, the wiki works again

[01:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me updates the IDL definitions

[01:34:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: do you already have a solution in mind?

[01:41:00.0000] <nessy>
foolip: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Timed_tracks

[01:42:00.0000] <nessy>
foolip: also note http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#the-track-element

[01:51:00.0000] <foolip>
nessy: I've skimmed what little there is in the spec, it seems to disallow two <track>s of the same kind/lang/label

[01:52:00.0000] <foolip>
oh, nice figure: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Timed_tracks#Architecture

[01:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: do you envision <track> being used for audio/video captions in the future? or separate <audio>/<video> for that use case?

[01:54:01.0000] <foolip>
so, looks like the intention is that CSS applied to <video> cascades to the external tracks, which I guess does make sense if one wants to style multiplexed tracks too (cc zcorpan)

[01:56:00.0000] <foolip>
http://damowmow.com/temp/srtspec

[01:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: i expect we'll have to sync multiple media elements, rather than have them be part of <track>

[01:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: since basically we'd have to duplicate all of <video> to do overlaid sign language captions

[01:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: ok

[01:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
no plans to do that this time though

[02:16:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie,  <span title="dom-MutableMediaTrack-addCue">addCue"> doesn't work

[02:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
thx

[02:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me sighs at the //head/object thread

[02:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
what order should video.tracks be in?

[02:27:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: first <track>s in document-order, then tracks from the media resource, IMO

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
so if you insert a <track>, it renumbers existing tracks?

[02:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
that'd be a bit weird

[02:29:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
you could do the media resource, then external tracks, in which case you can avoid any renumering by always appending

[02:29:01.0000] <foolip>
I think with multiple <source>s where only some have internal tracks would be worse, where the script breaks because the order changed

[02:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej_: you get the external ones first

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej_: almost always

[02:30:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
is it at all common to have both?

[02:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej_: since they are declared in the file, which is likely to be read long before the network returns the video

[02:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
s/file/html/

[02:30:04.0000] <othermaciej_>
ah, I see what you mean

[02:30:05.0000] <Hixie>
btw there's also a third source, which is scripted tracks

[02:31:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
I don't think you can avoid renumbering when you add <track>s in the DOM then

[02:31:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
unless you give up on the track state being inferrable from the DOM

[02:31:02.0000] <othermaciej_>
generally it's good for DOM APIs not to be path-dependent

[02:31:03.0000] <othermaciej_>
IMO

[02:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
well we can add them in first-come-first-served, which trades predictability from run to run for consistency of the index of the objects in the array

[02:32:01.0000] <foolip>
it's quite likely not all browsers will detect the same resource-internal tracks during a period of implementation, which favors putting them at the end where it creates a smaller mess

[02:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
or we can do them in a defined order, in which case you can't keep a hold of the position... but then you can keep hold of the object that represents the track, so that's ok

[02:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
ok, fair enough

[02:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
<track>, then script-added, then those in the video file

[02:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
should the <track> ones be sorted in the order they were inserted into the <Video> element, or in DOM order? I guess the latter, if they are removed when you remove the <Track> element

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk>
DOM order is what most collections do

[02:37:01.0000] <annevk>
apart from some esoteric form collection iirc

[02:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
should it be possible to dynamically change a track's kind, label, and language?

[02:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if it's represented by an element and those things are attributes, it would be weird if you couldn't

[02:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess so

[02:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[03:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#timed-tracks - the basic data model definitions

[03:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
still nothing really useful :-)

[04:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:35:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie,  do you have any familiarity and/or biases for/against the sctp protocol?

[05:15:00.0000] <nessy>
that was a late Hixie night!

[05:16:00.0000] <nessy>
good start on video a11y stuff though!

[05:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Late? That's quite early by his standards, no?

[05:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie's standards are weird

[05:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me may or may not have intended the double meaning

[05:17:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie's standards are just drafts

[05:18:00.0000] <nessy>
lol

[05:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
They can never become standards with only one implementation, after all

[06:46:00.0000] <mut>
hey, anyone know if there is a way i can get coordinates of a line i drew on canvas, after i applied a transform() ?

[06:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
mut: You can't, except by writing code to do the maths yourself

[06:51:00.0000] <mut>
ok

[06:51:01.0000] <mut>
is there any documentation on scale/translate functions, so i can see how it works?

[06:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I think "setTransform(m11, m12, m21, m22, dx, dy); moveTo(x, y)" is equivalent to "moveTo(m11*x+m21*y+dx, m12*x+m22*y+dy)")

[06:53:00.0000] <mut>
ok

[06:53:01.0000] <mut>
that looks pretty easy

[06:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
scale/translate are easy - they just multiply or add to the coordinates

[06:53:03.0000] <mut>
its rotate thats bothering me

[06:53:04.0000] <mut>
:P

[06:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah - rotate(a) is like transform(cos(a), sin(a), -sin(a), cos(a), 0, 0)

[06:54:01.0000] <mut>
ah yea

[06:55:00.0000] <mut>
so if i recreate those functions, i can actually replace them for my purposes

[06:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
It's just linear algebra :)

[06:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
or maybe more like transform(cos(a), -sin(a), sin(a), cos(a), 0, 0)

[06:55:03.0000] <mut>
heh yea its a long time since ive done any :)

[06:55:04.0000] <theMadness>
All this math is making me feel like a real programmer (as opposed to a web programmer, of course)

[06:56:00.0000] <mut>
thanks a lot Philip`

[06:56:01.0000] <mut>
ill just crack on and write my own functions

[07:12:00.0000] <workmad3>
Philip`: I think that's just the difference between clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation :)

[07:13:00.0000] <workmad3>
/me misses playing around with mathes in programming

[07:19:00.0000] <mr_danie1>
mut: if you have a app where it is important to track the current position of an element, maybe SVG is a better solution for your problem

[07:20:00.0000] <mr_danie1>
especially when you want to track the mouse as an input source

[07:20:01.0000] <mut>
hmmm

[07:20:02.0000] <mut>
well i dont need to track the mouse

[07:21:00.0000] <mut>
its ok, i think ill be ok now

[07:21:01.0000] <mut>
its not as hard as i first feared

[07:25:00.0000] <mut>
and i can overwrite the translate/rotate functions right?

[07:38:00.0000] <raider5>
The majority of online resources are conflicted on the merits of having content first in the source

[07:42:00.0000] <JohnnyAmerica>
raider5: It depends on the context

[07:44:00.0000] <raider5>

By the way, congrats @adactio for the new book.

oh hey

[07:59:03.0000] <annevk>

gsnedders, actually Opera doesn't support innerHTML in XML

[08:39:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, Gecko does

[08:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me kinda wishes innerHTML always used the HTML serialization--even in XML DOMs

[08:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: We do in XHTML

[08:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: We do in XHTML

[08:41:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, no, we use the HTML parser; that's wrong per spec

[08:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
That's always using the HTML serialization.

[08:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I know it's wrong per spec.

[08:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Having a bug free impl and supporting something aren't identical, IMO

[08:43:00.0000] <annevk>
this is a fundamental flaw in the feature implementation

[08:43:01.0000] <annevk>
but whatever

[08:45:00.0000] <annevk>
"Internet Explorer web browser use drops below 60%" -- maybe that explains all the markety IE blog posts and Sylvain being cranky :p

[08:45:01.0000] <theMadness>
That goes without saying.

[09:02:00.0000] <raider5>
does anyone have any guidance regarding source order vs the visual order? the only decent information we can find is : http://usability.com.au/resources/source-order.cfm

[09:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
raider5: I'd probably listen to actual usability experts, but as far as I know Google puts more weight on content earlier in the page, so having good source order can help your rank at least.

[09:26:00.0000] <raider5>
TabAtkins: see that's the problem, there a lot of people saying similar things, however there is a lack of any evidence unfortunately. Do you have any concrete links you could point me to?

[09:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, that link you provided is backed up by actual usability testing.

[09:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And so seems reasonably beleivable.

[09:32:00.0000] <raider5>
yes but there is debate regarding the results of the testing, it would be good to have some official info from sound sources

[09:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
When you say "debate", are you just referring to the fact that the results were somewhat inconclusive on the question of source order in that study, or are there actual objections to the data in that study?

[09:34:00.0000] <raider5>
a bit of both really

[09:35:00.0000] <raider5>
I don't have the links to hand at the moment

[09:36:00.0000] <raider5>
Bruce Lawson seems to go with content first: http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2007/navigation-or-content-first/

[09:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Kk, then I dunno personally.  I personally prefer content-first for organizational purposes, and from everything I've read it's neutral at worst.

[09:38:00.0000] <raider5>
yeah that's the conclusion I'm coming to... the only thing that is pushing me more towards navigation first is that the majority of sites are structured that way... it's almost a standard which people expect

[09:38:01.0000] <raider5>
and if there is no benefit, I'd rather stick with convention

[09:39:00.0000] <rektide>
why oh why did ian give in w/r/t video codecs

[09:39:01.0000] <rektide>

[09:39:02.0000] <rektide>
i've already seen two posts calling this gif wars 2.0

[09:40:00.0000] <erlehmann>
rektide, because he can't change anything.

[09:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
rektide, there have been many comparisons with gif ever since this issue first came up

[09:40:02.0000] <erlehmann>
opera, mozilla, google are willing to implement theora in their browsers regardless of if it is mentioned in the spec.

[09:41:00.0000] <erlehmann>
and apple or microsoft are not gonna give in because of spec text.

[09:41:01.0000] <erlehmann>
especially not microsoft.

[09:41:02.0000] <erlehmann>
rektide, html5 is more descriptive than normative

[09:41:03.0000] <rektide>
microsoft not giving in

[09:41:04.0000] <rektide>
doesnt mean we shouldnt lord it against them

[09:42:00.0000] <rektide>
doesnt mean we shouldnt put it in the spec

[09:42:01.0000] <rektide>
specs are there a model for what you ought to be doing

[09:42:02.0000] <rektide>
*as a model

[09:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
rektide, the purpose of the spec is to define things that browsers will interoperably implement. It's not helpful to have the spec define a requirement that browser vendors have stated they will ignore

[09:44:01.0000] <rektide>
so the only time a spec is worth doing is if its unanimous?

[09:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, decisions made in the spec certainly aren't always unanimous. But they should at least be implementable and there should at least be a willingness among vendors to implement it.

[09:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
teh bottom line is, everyone knows the situation is not ideal. But trying to get the spec to mandate a specific codec for whatever reason will not help in the slightest to resolve the issues that web developers now face

[09:49:00.0000] <hober>
yup

[09:53:00.0000] <rektide>
i relent to acknowledging there is no way out, that the whole fiasco is a huge grey area.

[09:54:00.0000] <rektide>
i'd like to thank binary42 for taking me to task on the legal complexities of the issue in another channel

[10:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, wiki is working for me . . . I see some errors in /home/whatwikiuser/logs/mw-db-error claiming some tables doesn't exist, lost MySQL connections, broken tables, that kind of thing, but it seems to have stopped.about eleven hours ago.

where does the track / mediatrack work have origins?

[11:59:01.0000] <rektide>
i'm thinking of kate / cmml / annotea / aria

[11:59:02.0000] <rektide>
as other standards for annotation of realtime streams

[12:00:00.0000] <rektide>
not that they have api's

[12:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait, there's an Erik Möller who works for Opera?  That's also the name of the deputy director of Wikimedia.

[12:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Confusing.  :()

s/)$//

[12:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Perhaps people need to adopt GUIDs of some kind.  It would make some things so much simpler.

[13:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: we just need to assign everyone a unique URI

[13:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's an excellent idea.  You could then leverage it for personal websites and provider-independent e-mail addresses, too.

[13:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, the latter only if it's an actual domain name, perhaps, but you could also define some mapping of this URI format to e-mail addresses, perhaps.

[13:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That kind of thinking is so typical

[13:06:01.0000] <Dashiva>
What about people who go into witness protection?

[13:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I never said each person needs to have only *one* GUID.  No two people can have the same GUID, but no one says you can't have multiples, or change them.

[13:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That leads to a host of problems of its own

[13:16:00.0000] <Icozzo>
just what everyone wants, to be uniquely identifiable on the internet

[13:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Precisely!

[13:17:01.0000] <Icozzo>
but this GUID system is really just email by another name isn't it?

[13:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . maybe?

[13:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was indeed able to distinguish the two individuals in this case by @opera.com vs. @wikimedia.org.

[13:19:01.0000] <Icozzo>
then that means.. im uniquely identifiable on the internet by my.. email address!?!

[13:19:02.0000] <Icozzo>
/me runs

[13:19:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was really thinking more like inventing some memorable suffix to add to your name everywhere so people can tell you apart from other people with the same name.

[13:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, I'd have no problem, since I'm almost certainly the only person in the world with my name.

[13:20:01.0000] <Icozzo>
until I have a child, that is

[13:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
What?

[13:20:03.0000] <Icozzo>
then again, in the long run it's probably just cheaper to get a name change

[13:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, that's one way to fix it.  Have a global registry of names, and prohibit anyone from adopting a legal name that's already taken.

[13:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would promote so much creativity in naming!

[13:22:01.0000] <Icozzo>
Nick44651 Smith

[13:22:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It must be a great idea!

[13:22:03.0000] <jwm>
hehe

[13:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
We can decentralize it by requiring toponyms.  We could require people to add the (unique-ified) name of their city to the end, like "Aryeh Gregor of New York".  Then you would only have to maintain per-city registries.

[13:23:01.0000] <Icozzo>
I wonder how many days it would take until something like xXxWarrior69xXx is registered as a legal name

[13:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, well -- if it's good enough for the Internet, it's good enough for real life.

[13:23:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's my motto.

[13:23:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Possibly because I don't have a real life.

[13:24:00.0000] <Icozzo>
That's how it worked before surnames didn't it?

[13:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Before surnames, people mostly relied on the fact that almost nobody traveled much.

[13:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, in most places you had other disambiguation anyway, like a patronymic or toponym or such.

[13:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
For instance, ancient Israelites were identified by their personal name, father's name, and tribe.  Greeks usually used a personal name, plus some combination of patronymic and toponym.

[13:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Republican Rome had family names, but you also used the name of your father, *and* his father, because the Romans had a very small supply of personal names.

[13:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So few that they almost all had one- or two-letter abbreviations.

[13:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So Julius Caesar would formally be known as C·IVLIVS·C·F·C·N·CAESAR – "Gaius Julius, son of Gaius, grandson of Gaius, Caesar".

[13:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nobody bothers with the "Gaius" part because like 10% of Roman men were named "Gaius".

[13:27:01.0000] <Icozzo>
yea that's what I was thinking of, toponymy in Greece

[13:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Everyone called each other by last names.  If two people had the same last name, they got nicknames.

[13:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like Pliny the Younger and Pliny the Elder, or Scipio Africanus and Scipio . . . whatever the other one was, Germanicus or whatnot.

[13:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Women didn't even get first names at all, they got numbered.  The daughter of someone in the Julius family would be named Julia.  If she had a sister, they'd be Julia Majora and Julia Minora.  More, and it would be Julia Prima, Julia Secunda, Julia Tertia, . . .

[13:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Romans were crazy.

[13:28:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
They also gave us our calendar, with inexplicable random month lengths.

[13:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
variable: Have fun :) I suggest working through the parts that you particularly care about first and seeing how far you get

[13:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
(you might, of course, care most about the parts that people have complained about the most)

[13:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't have a percentage count of pages with <image>, since he only counted post-parser element names and so there's none called "image"

[13:46:00.0000] <variable>
jgraham: nice subtle hint. Any particular parts that people have complained the most about. I follow the ML but I don't keep track of statistics of complaints ;)

[13:46:01.0000] <Icozzo>

[13:47:02.0000] <Icozzo>
No i mean the percentage count of pages using <image> instead of <img>, sorry.

They'd know better than anyone.

[13:48:00.0000] <variable>
lcozzo - true. Just wondering if anyone had sources re that specific number

"The goal of type="username" is to indicate to the UA which form is the login form. This would allow features such as "remember me" and autofill to be done in the UA instead of in the browser."

[13:53:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Does anyone understand what the UA is supposed to be here?

[13:53:02.0000] <variable>
Dashiva: that was my email ;) I thing I meant instead of the website :)

[13:53:03.0000] <Philip`>
What's the UA instead of the browser?

[13:53:04.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[13:55:00.0000] <variable>
Dashiva: part of the reason for type="username" is to make it easier for projects such as Mozilla Accounts Manager (a project that seeks to put the login/logout into the browser)

[14:02:00.0000] <variable>
Philip`: should I put those specific examples in the wiki page or should I leave it general "some times"

[14:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
variable: Depends on whether you think reasonable people will doubt an unsubstantiated but easy-to-demonstrate statement that many examples exist

[14:52:00.0000] <variable>
heh - true

[14:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's a nail-biting race between the one offering fairness, the one offering change, and the one offering change and fairness

[14:54:00.0000] <variable>
Philip`: look at the last politician to offer change (in the US) and decide if you really want it ;

[14:55:00.0000] <variable>
/me says nothing about my opinion on the current US pres.

[14:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
I guess Philip` will get change and fairness regardless (unless he is registered to vote somewhere other than Cambridge, in which case I have no idea)

[14:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I didn't know the conservatives were offering change

[14:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Fairness sounds good and change sounds good, so I should be happy whatever the outcome is

[14:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
I assume change == conservatives, fairness == Labour and both == Lib Dem

[14:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
In Philip`'s scheme

[14:58:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I have equal trouble attributing fairness to conservatives as I have with change

[14:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's not my scheme, it's theirs

[14:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Possibly their slogan is "Change that will disappoint"

[14:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Unless they mean "change back to how things were before"

[15:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
It's not a vote winner but would be at least 50% honest

[15:00:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Feudalism would be a huge change without accidentally creating fairness

[16:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
so loading timed tracks needs to delay playback

[16:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are several ways we could do this

[16:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
we could make timed tracks interact with readyState

[16:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
this seems like it would be rather complicated though

[16:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
we could just make potentially playing be false when there's pending tracks

[16:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
that seems simplest

[16:33:04.0000] <Hixie>
if we do the latter, we presumably need to fire an event to say that this is what we're waiting for

[16:33:05.0000] <Hixie>
should we fire 'waiting'?

[16:33:06.0000] <Hixie>
'stalled'?

[16:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
a new event?

[16:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
doing a new event has the advantage that we don't have to fiddle with the definitions of the existing events

[16:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
and makes it easier to work out what exactly we're waiting for

[16:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
but means yet more events to wait for

[16:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Possibly a risk in people writing code not considering timed tracks, which then breaks with tracks?

[16:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's a risk either way

[16:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think i'm leaning towards firing 'waiting' at the media element, as if we were buffering

[16:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
which will be a pain to specify, but is probably better than having a different event

[16:43:00.0000] <nessy>
I'm not even sure I would want the video to have to wait for captions to be loaded

[16:44:00.0000] <nessy>
most of the time the captions will be loaded fast and stalling the video in the middle of playback seems disruptive

[16:45:00.0000] <nessy>
would it be better to have a sort of state on the track element that explains how far it is along with loading and if somebody really wants their video to wait for it, they can pause playback to wait for the appropriate state change?

[16:46:00.0000] <nessy>
I can understand waiting with putting video into METADATA_LOADED state until all pre-activated track elements are loaded

[16:46:01.0000] <nessy>
but during playback, i would really find it disruptive

[16:46:02.0000] <nessy>
YouTube doesn't wait for captions to be received either


2010-05-05
[17:39:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: there is actually an interesting and relevant discussion around text audio descriptions on the a11y tf right now, too

[17:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: k

[17:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: re stopping playback, it seems it would be really bad to not stop playback if it means missing the first few captions each time

[17:44:00.0000] <nessy>
oh for a video from the start I have no issues with that

[17:44:01.0000] <nessy>
but I think it may be too disruptive when somebody turns on the captions while the video is playing back

[17:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
well if you've got the whole caption track at the start, then you'll never stall later, will you?

[17:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
or am i missing something

[17:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
how are you expecting stalling to happen?

[17:45:00.0000] <nessy>
for example you have a video that has a german, french and english subtitle track

[17:45:01.0000] <nessy>
you start the video without any subtitle track active, because you don't think you need it

[17:45:02.0000] <nessy>
after a few minutes your realize you want the french subtitle track turned on, go to the menu and select it

[17:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
ah, interesting...

[17:45:04.0000] <nessy>
now, because none was active before, none of the files were downloaded

[17:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
that would indeed be a simpler model

[17:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
so basically just check at the start before autoplaying

[17:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
and not stall for any other reason

[17:46:02.0000] <nessy>
yes, I'd say so

[17:46:03.0000] <nessy>
YouTube does it this way

[17:46:04.0000] <nessy>
also make sure that the active tracks are loaded before going to METADATA_LOADED state - that's all

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
METADATA_LOADED?

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh you mean HAVE_METADATA?

[17:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[17:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess that would make the model simpler

[17:50:00.0000] <nessy>
ah sorry :)

[17:50:01.0000] <nessy>
but you would need a state on the track so ppl can decide to implement a different behaviour using javascript

[17:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
pausing before HAVE_METADATA until active tracks have loaded would work for me

[17:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. just during initial load

[17:52:00.0000] <nessy>
exactly

[17:52:01.0000] <nessy>
since text tracks usually load faster than video, it shouldn't introduce extra delays, but you never know

[17:54:00.0000] <nessy>
gah - just had a proposal to use SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) as an externally associated text format

[17:55:00.0000] <nessy>
for audio descriptions...

[17:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's wrong with Speech CSS?

[17:56:01.0000] <nessy>
what's that?

[17:56:02.0000] <nessy>
/me goes checking it ou

[17:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
same as regular CSS, btu for aural media

[17:56:04.0000] <nessy>
cool

[17:57:00.0000] <nessy>
does it work with WebSRT ?

[17:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
it would work the same as screen css, sure

[17:57:02.0000] <nessy>
that might solve this issue!

[17:57:03.0000] <nessy>
thanks!

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really understand the issue, but np! :-)

[17:58:01.0000] <nessy>
do web browser support speech css?

[17:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
no

[17:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
do they support SSML?

[17:58:04.0000] <nessy>
don't think so

[18:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
note that <video> supports changing the playback rate; this would also affect captions, naturally

[18:02:00.0000] <nessy>
well, I am trying to find a way that we can get away with only WebSRT as a format - but if there are richer formats for text audio descriptions than just SRT, then it might be difficult

[18:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are far reacher formats. .wav, say.

[18:02:02.0000] <nessy>
really? video supports changing the playback rate? is there an attribute?

[18:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
.playbackRate

[18:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
and .defaultPlaybackRate

[18:02:05.0000] <nessy>
gah, I missed that!

[18:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
s/reacher/richer/

[18:09:00.0000] <nessy>
have browsers implemented the playbackRate attribute?

[18:10:00.0000] <nessy>
well, I'll go and find out :)

[18:12:00.0000] <annevk>
nessy, Opera hasn't

[18:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, doesn't Opera support aural CSS?

[18:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe

[19:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is WebKit planning on implementing MathML in the foreseeable future?

[19:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: there's an implementation in progress

[19:03:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so yes

[19:03:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, awesome.

[19:03:04.0000] <othermaciej>
it's off by default in the builds right now though

[19:03:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
We were just talking about math rendering in #mediawiki.

[19:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So it will be a typical all-but-IE thing.  Probably it would make sense to skip straight to MathML and not try intermediate solutions like jsMath, in that case.

[19:13:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: are volume and muted attributes of <video> that can be used by authors?

[19:14:00.0000] <nessy>
i.e. can they be used as in <video volume="0.5" muted> or are they just javascript interfaces?

[19:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
JS

[19:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what it would mean to have them be content attributes

[19:14:03.0000] <nessy>
ah cool - defaultPlaybackRate is a content attribute though?

[19:15:00.0000] <nessy>
well, it would mean to start a video muted and with a specific volume setting - but I am only documenting it, not wanting to introduce anything

[19:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Content attributes are listed here: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#video

[19:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Global attributes, src, poster, preload, autoplay, loop, controls, width, height, that's it.

[19:38:00.0000] <nessy>
but the way that I read defaultPlaybackRate it is also a content attribute

[19:38:01.0000] <nessy>
that's what's been confusing me

[19:40:00.0000] <nessy>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html#loading-the-media-resource says

[19:40:01.0000] <nessy>
"Set the playbackRate attribute to the value of the defaultPlaybackRate attribute."

[19:41:00.0000] <nessy>
in the media element loading algorithm

[19:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
should i ignore dynamic changes to <track src> made after the track has loaded?

[19:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
or should i support unloading a track and reloading it?

[19:43:02.0000] <boogyman>
latter

[19:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
what's the use case?

[19:44:00.0000] <boogyman>
what's the harm

[19:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's a big implementation and specification burden

[19:44:02.0000] <boogyman>
'because it's hard' is generally not an acceptable 'excuse'

[19:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
sure it is

[19:45:00.0000] <jwm>
heh

[19:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's probably the main reason for not doing things

[19:45:02.0000] <jwm>
I don't like doing things unless they are hard

[19:45:03.0000] <nessy>
do we allow it for videos?

[19:45:04.0000] <boogyman>
so it's okay to do web dev with nested tables, because it's 'easy' ?

[19:45:05.0000] <boogyman>
:-s

[19:46:00.0000] <jwm>
nested tables made me millions

[19:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: it's easier to use semantic markup than tables

[19:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: so i don't buy that

[19:46:03.0000] <boogyman>
I agree, but new developers don't view it as such

[19:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: but generally speaking, there are often cases where there are other even more important reasons to do something that override the "it's hard" reason not to do it

[19:46:05.0000] <nessy>
I think since we do it for videos, it would be inconsistent not to allow it for <track>

[19:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: the question is here, what's the reason for doing it that overrides the reason not to do it?

[19:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: we don't do it for <source>

[19:47:02.0000] <nessy>
but for <video src> ?

[19:48:00.0000] <boogyman>
Hixie: I don't have a use-case, but I am sure that it would be greatly appreciated by developers to implement

[19:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes, for <video> src we do it, but there's a good reason to support that (how else would you change the video?)

[19:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: i'm having trouble imagining when a dev would ever do it

[19:48:03.0000] <nessy>
if somebody changes the video's src half way through via JS, they would surely also need to change the <track src> that relate to that video

[19:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
surely they'd just blow away the <track>s and insert entirely new ones

[19:48:05.0000] <Hixie>
not mutate the existing ones

[19:49:00.0000] <nessy>
I see

[19:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
just like with <source>

[19:49:02.0000] <nessy>
yeah, I think that's fair enough

[19:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess we can always change it later

[19:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
if there's a use case

[19:50:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: I am writing a book on html5 video and am currently documenting content attributes - is defaultPlaybackRate a content attribute?

[19:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
no

[19:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
the list of content attributes is in the spec in several places

[19:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. in the green box in the element's definition

[19:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
under "Content attributes:"

[19:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
or in the index at the bottom of the spec

[19:51:00.0000] <boogyman>
Ian, As a developer, I would be annoyed if I was required to destroy and create a new <track>, however I was able to just mutate a <video>

[19:51:01.0000] <nessy>
yeah, but that confuses me with the defaultPlaybackRate, since it would make sense to set it as content attribute and then use only playbackRate in JS

[19:52:00.0000] <boogyman>
plus as nessy pointed out, it's inconsistent

[19:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: defaultPlaybackRate is the rate of playback, playbackRate is the rate you'd use when ffwding or rewinding

[19:52:02.0000] <nessy>
it's as inconsistent as the <source> elements are

[19:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: well, if we do support it... what happens to the TimedTrackCue objects?

[19:52:04.0000] <nessy>
ok, thanks

[19:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: seems weird that we'd suddenly orphan all those objects...

[19:53:01.0000] <nessy>
kill them all ;)

[19:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: i can't think of any time we do that currently

[19:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: would their .track be reset so you could insert them into an API-created timed track? that'd be even weirder...

[19:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: there's lots of cases where we don't react to changes like this, btw, e.g. if you change the <base href=""> base URL, we don't reload anything dynamically

[19:54:01.0000] <boogyman>
I'm not familiar with those objects, reference literature?

[19:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: even though technically all the URLs in the doc changed

[19:54:03.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: they're the new ones for the timed track API

[19:54:04.0000] <boogyman>
ack! enter spam :|

[19:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
btw, should i name these interfaces MediaTrack/MediaCue or TimedTrack/TimedTrackCue ?

[19:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
hm, gotta go for dinner, bbl to continue!

[19:57:00.0000] <nessy>
does a change to <video src> blow away all the <source> elements?

[19:58:00.0000] <nessy>
I like MediaTrack/MediaCue

[20:08:00.0000] <boogyman>
Hixie: After reading through the spec, I think it would be easier to just remove and recreate the <track>, both from a developer stand point, as well as UI implementation

[22:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: <video src> overrides <source> but doesn't affect the dom

[22:18:00.0000] <nessy>
what I meant was when you use JS to change the currentSrc

[22:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
currentSrc is readonly, no?

[22:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
boogyman: k :-)

[22:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i would reuse existing <source> and <track>s if all my videos have the same pattern

[22:19:01.0000] <nessy>
sorry, when you change the @src attribute

[22:19:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: changing <souce> or blowing them away and inserting new ones requires a load() anyway

[22:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-/

[22:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
having dynamic changes to src="" affect <track> is going to be a pain

[22:21:00.0000] <nessy>
what I expected was dynamic change to @src blows away <source> and <track>

[22:21:01.0000] <zcorpan>
my knee-jerk reaction is that we could ignore dynamic updates to <track src> and just reevaluate all <track>s in the media load algorithm

[22:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
changing src="" makes the <source> elements get ignored, but doesn't affect the DOM

[22:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: oh you want to wait until the media is loaded to load the subtitle tracks? hmm

[22:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: no

[22:22:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: the media load algorithm starts when the <video> tag is parsed

[22:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but it does nothing much the first time and is restarted when you set src="" or append a <source>, right?

[22:23:01.0000] <nessy>
I see - <source> is easier than <track>, since <source> isn't relevant any more … hmmm

[22:23:02.0000] <zcorpan>
it's restarted when you set <video src=""> but not when you append a <source>

[22:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
appending a <source> just spins the resource selection algorithm if it sits waiting for another <source>

[22:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
either way it seems weird to link them

[22:26:00.0000] <nessy>
so when you set <video src=""> and the media load algorithm is restarted, then it should also re-load all active <text> elements, which could have been changed in the meantime

[22:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[22:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
the reason that's weird is that other changes to <track> still take effect, the way the system is set up so far

[22:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
it is kind of weird for <track label> to be live but <track src> not to be

[22:27:03.0000] <zcorpan>
i agree

[22:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
sigh... i should just bite the bullet and make src="" dynamic

[22:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins__>
Dashiva: Random question: What's the unicode shocked dude with the monocle?

[22:30:00.0000] <foucist>
Hixie: any thoughts about p2p or listening sockets with websockets?  for browser2browser connectivity..  if people can have local-REST/local web services for their personal data and share it however they want..

[22:30:01.0000] <foucist>
i know the docs mention p2p

[22:30:02.0000] <foucist>
just wondering what the motivation is etc

[22:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
video conferencing, that kind of thing

[22:37:00.0000] <foucist>
ah

[23:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
U+0000 problem: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=563526

[23:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes the routr UI developers were a little more careful

[23:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's failing to go into <frameset> because of a leading null?

[23:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
right

[00:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok what should this format's MIME type be

[00:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
text/captions?

[00:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
text/subtitles?

[00:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
text/timed-track?

[00:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
text/cues?

[00:00:05.0000] <Hixie>
text/websrt?

[00:01:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me wonders if there is a discussion going on right now that he is unaware of

[00:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: i'm going through the feedback on captions and subtitles to add timed tracks for <video> in HTML

[00:01:02.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: if you're thinking of anything for captioning, keep in mind that captioning with markup is in use on TV today

[00:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: based on http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Timed_tracks

[00:01:04.0000] <virtuelv>
not only with markup, but also with positioning data

[00:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: pretty much everything under the sun is in use somewhere :-)

[00:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: i mean, DVDs for example use just raw bitmaps :-)

[00:03:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: please tell me that is a joke

[00:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm afraid not :-(

[00:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
not just DVDs, either

[00:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
CVD, DVB, SVCD, and XSUB are also image-based

[00:04:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
that would explain the quality

[00:05:00.0000] <doublec>
what does 'srt' stand for? Is it an acronym?

[00:05:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
well, Wikipedia calls them primiarly subtitles, but YouTube calls them captions

[00:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
doublec: SRT is the format SubRip used... I guess SubRip Text?

[00:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
SubRipTitles?

[00:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

[00:05:05.0000] <doublec>
If you call it websrt people are going to want to know :)

[00:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
if we call it websrt we'd come up with a backronym

[00:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
Web Subtitle Resource Track or something

[00:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
the only reason i'd call it WebSRT is to give a hat tip to the existing SRT community

[00:10:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
"Most of the world does not distinguish captions from subtitles. In the United States and Canada, these terms do have different meanings, however: "subtitles" assume the viewer can hear but cannot understand the language or accent, or the speech is not entirely clear, so they only transcribe dialogue and some on-screen text. "Captions" aim to describe to the hearing-impaired all significant audio content—spoken dialogue and non-sp

[00:10:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
eech information such as the identity of speakers and, occasionally, their manner of speaking—along with music or sound effects using words or symbols."

[00:13:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
http://screenfont.ca/learn/

[00:18:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the Norwegian terms for either variant is

[00:24:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Hixie: Is ::cue a proposal?

[00:30:00.0000] <virtuelv>
"subtitled"

[00:31:00.0000] <virtuelv>
or "subtitled for the hearing-impaired"

[00:36:00.0000] <nessy>
text/websrt

[00:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that seems better than the other options

[00:37:01.0000] <nessy>
yeah, definitely

[00:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
GPHemsley: yes

[00:42:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
given the confusion between subtitles and captions, I would think that timed-track would be a good generic name

[00:42:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
but if you wanna backronym WebSRT, I guess that's OK

[00:42:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
I'm just kinda tired of WebXYZ

[00:43:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
makes me think of WebTV and WebDAV and whatever else, unnecessarily

[00:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
you'd rather we went back to Xfoo? :-)

[00:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
text/websrt makes sense

[00:48:00.0000] <nessy>
if we call the format webSRT, then text/websrt makes sense - I wasn't aware we're still discussing the name of the format though

[00:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
WebSRT is nice and pronouncable, XSRT not so much

[00:50:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
I was actually hoping for just calling it what it is

[00:51:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
(and I wasn't aware that the name WebSRT was already decided on)

[00:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[00:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
if we want to make WebSRT compatible with legacy files and UAs, we can't have a magic string, huh

[00:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
bummer

[00:55:00.0000] <nessy>
magic string?

[00:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
a set of bytes guaranteed to be at the start of the file

[00:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
so that files can be recognised unambiguously

[00:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
like how cache manifests have to start with "CACHE MANIFEST"

[00:56:03.0000] <nessy>
ah, you wanted to add that at the beginning of WebSRT?

[00:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
ideally i'd like every format to have a magic string, but i don't see a way to do it with websrt

[00:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
so :-(

[00:57:00.0000] <nessy>
well, it won't be backwards compatible for most cases anyway

[00:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
why not?

[00:57:02.0000] <nessy>
I'd assume that most parsers have a problem with the extensions

[00:57:03.0000] <nessy>
but that is a wild guess - I haven't got any hard facts on that

[00:57:04.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but most extensions aren't going to be used most of the time

[00:57:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: did you test the extensions with mplayer, VLC, etc.?

[00:57:06.0000] <nessy>
should give it a shot ;)

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: no

[00:58:01.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: indeed, should give it a shot!

[00:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't expect any UAs to handle the extensions well

[01:02:00.0000] <nessy>
in which case I wouldn't be too worried about adding things like the magic string

[01:03:00.0000] <nessy>
but I can see that it might be stepping over a line

[01:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it goes from making it possible to write compatible files to making it impossible

[01:04:01.0000] <nessy>
yeah, I can see that

[01:05:00.0000] <nessy>
incidentally - did you introduce a means for style sheets?

[01:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's a big difference between "if you avoid using the extensions it'll keep working" or "old SRT files will work with this", and "you can't make files that work with both web browsers and legacy video players" or "old SRT files won't work with web browsers"

[01:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
a new means? what's wrong with the existing means for style sheets?

[01:06:00.0000] <nessy>
I mean: to associate style sheets with WebSRT files?

[01:06:01.0000] <nessy>
not sure if that was the plan though

[01:06:02.0000] <nessy>
/me has some catching-up reading to do

[01:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
why would they be associated with WebSRT files? isn't it the <video> files that you'd want to style?

[01:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
s/<video> files/<video> elements/

[01:07:02.0000] <nessy>
what if I want the styling in a non-web-browser?

[01:08:00.0000] <nessy>
video file + websrt file + style sheet for the cues

[01:08:01.0000] <nessy>
no

[01:08:02.0000] <nessy>
ups: no?

[01:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
how is the subtitle file being linked to the video file?

[01:09:01.0000] <nessy>
usually  the video player just loads it as an external file

[01:09:02.0000] <nessy>
e.g. vlc: you load the video then you load the srt file

[01:10:00.0000] <nessy>
it's your knowledge that links the two ;)

[01:10:01.0000] <nessy>
or often file names

[01:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
well if they want to support CSS i guess they can just load the style sheet that way too :-)

[01:10:03.0000] <nessy>
hehe!

[01:10:04.0000] <nessy>
are there embedded styles?

[01:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the use case?

[01:11:01.0000] <nessy>
well, all other richer caption formats allow to provide styling inside the caption file, so I wondered if websrt did that too

[01:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't have a proposal to do that so far

[01:12:01.0000] <nessy>
things like background colour on cues

[01:12:02.0000] <nessy>
ok

[01:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
i considered inline formatting to be a feature to avoid when i was looking at formats though

[01:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
if there's a use case for it then i should restudy the formats :-)

[01:13:00.0000] <nessy>
not sure

[01:13:01.0000] <nessy>
it's different to how it is now, but then you could argue that it's nicer this way

[01:13:02.0000] <nessy>
at least you can pick your preferred style sheet and apply it to all captions that you receive

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
personally i don't see why we'd want the authors to style the captions at all

[01:14:01.0000] <nessy>
and it's called websrt for a reason ;)

[01:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i'm willing to compromise with allowing the authors to put styling hints in CSS

[01:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
so long as i can turn it off

[01:15:00.0000] <nessy>
fair enough

[01:16:00.0000] <nessy>
the semantic markup, however, is what the author knows best, such as speaker names, what is emphasised, etc

[01:16:01.0000] <nessy>
but how that is styled is indeed a different matter

[01:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
voices, emphasis, etc, we should support, sure

[01:17:00.0000] <nessy>
am impressed by your progress, btw

[01:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
well once we'd figured out the use cases, the spec writing is just spec writing

[01:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's the easy part

[01:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
the hard part is working out what the requirements are and coming up with an idea to address them

[01:19:00.0000] <nessy>
and that was good work, too

[01:19:01.0000] <nessy>
anyway - gotta go shopping -  l8r

[01:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
later

[02:08:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie,  do you have any familiarity and/or biases for/against the sctp protocol?

[02:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
mcarter: nope

[02:11:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, its a low-level transport-level protocol that lets you start multiple separate channels within a single session. those channels can either be reliable streams or unreliable/message-oriented

[02:12:00.0000] <mcarter>
Hixie, I'm looking into existing implementations to see how complicated they are; I think it could be a good choice for the post-handshake PeerConnection protocol

[02:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[02:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm hoping i can not be involved at all with that level of the peer-to-peer stuff

[02:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[03:22:00.0000] <boblet>
hey all

[03:23:00.0000] <boblet>
a bunch of Moz bugs being closed with “Fixed: HTML5 parser” — anyone know when it’s slated for release? 3.6.4?

[03:23:01.0000] <boblet>
/me crosses fingers

[03:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
boblet: i think certainly not 3.6.x

[03:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>
boblet: 3.7 or later

[03:25:00.0000] <boblet>
zcorpan: aaw

[03:25:01.0000] <boblet>
do you have a rough timeline?

[03:25:02.0000] <zcorpan>
ask hsivonen

(I was led to believe it would not be soon tho)

[03:26:00.0000] <boblet>
hsivonen: yt?

[03:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
boblet: It either is on by default or has been temporarily backed out due to broken testcases. All being well I think it is expected to ship in firefox.next

[03:29:00.0000] <boblet>
jgraham: I was under the impression it was off by default atm due to said breakage. I would love to be wrong about this in the near future (was under the impression default-HTML5-parser Firefox.next was mid-term, not near-)

[03:30:00.0000] <boblet>
heh

[03:30:01.0000] <boblet>
adactio: hsivonen is afk, so it’s all rumor and hearsay atm ;-)

[03:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
boblet: It was turned on by default for a while but caused some problems with (unrelated aiui) tests

[03:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
boblet, it was apparently turned back off due to this bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=562333

[03:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
mentioned in commit message http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/ccb50d524490

[03:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
boblet: I'm here

[03:32:01.0000] <boblet>
Lachy: thanks. woah, didn’t realise it was that recent

[03:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: BTW, regarding solubility of washing power, the answer is "any chemistry textbook"

[03:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
boblet: I don't comment on Firefox release schedule. Not my call.

[03:32:04.0000] <boblet>
hsivonen: we’re rumor-milling about the block-level link bug being closed with Fixed: HTML5 parser…

[03:32:05.0000] <boblet>
hehehe

[03:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, let's not bring that silly discussion-list discussion about washing machines/powders out of the discussion list.

[03:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: and it has been turned back on again on Monday

[03:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this time without tweets in case it is turned back off again

[03:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: It is way more annoying on the discussion list which I typically assosciate with vaugely-work-related discussion :)

[03:34:02.0000] <boblet>
hsivonen: that’s great news!

[03:34:03.0000] <zcorpan>
let's tweet!

[03:34:04.0000] <boblet>
already did :P

[03:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: (often the emphasis is on "vaugely")

[03:35:01.0000] <boblet>
great to hear HTML5 parser is back on in trunk tho

[03:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me still has about 200 old bugs to check in case they got FIXED

[03:36:01.0000] <boblet>
ouchies

[03:36:02.0000] <boblet>
sorry for my dupes!

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
boblet: while I don't comment on the timeline or the number of the major release after 3.6, I can say with good confidence that the HTML5 parser won't be on by default in 3.6.4.

[03:53:00.0000] <boblet>
hsivonen: thanks :)

[07:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
my head explodes when trying to follow the algorithms for unloading documents

[07:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Mine normally just implodes. I guess we cancel each other out.

[07:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so if i navigate away from a document that has an open websocket, should it "discard the document"?

[08:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Maybe we should remove all UI for navigating away from documents, force all new documents to be in their own tab and make closing old tabs impossible without closing the browser

[08:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
It would make our lives easier anyway

[08:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I suggest removing the UI for opening documents, too

[08:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
That would make your lives trivial

[08:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: Yes

[08:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
I think it should discard the document

[08:07:02.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[08:07:03.0000] <zcorpan>
now i wonder how to test it

[08:07:04.0000] <zcorpan>
assuming pageshow is not supported

[08:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
(recycle is false except in the document.open case and salvagable is false if a websocket had to be closed)

[08:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Why does pageshow make a difference?

[08:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
pageshow exposes whether the document was discarded

[08:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh I see

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you can't find a way to test it, doesn't that mean it's not observable behaviour and therefore does not need to be implemented how the spec says?

[08:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think i found a way to test it

[08:19:01.0000] <zcorpan>
it's observable in various ways

[08:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
scripts run again if it was discarded

[08:20:01.0000] <zcorpan>
timeouts are still active if it was not

[08:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i just need to store a value in sessionStorage to tell whether the script is running the first time or the second time

[08:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
would be nice to have a list of things that cause a document to be discarded when navigated

[08:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and how to prevent it from being discarded

[08:38:01.0000] <zcorpan>
in the case of websockets, i assume you'd close() the websockets in the pagehide event

[08:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan: It is almost a case of looking through the spec of things that set the salbageable state to false, no?

[08:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
*salvageable

[08:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
You can't really give a complete list because "Other specifications can define more."

[08:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: yeah, but i don't think browsers match the spec exactly

[08:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
what i meant was it'd be nice to compile the real list by reverse engineering browsers

[11:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
XBL2 doesn't require XHTML, does it?  It'll work fine with HTML, if I'm understanding things correctly.

[11:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
in what sense?

[11:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
XBL2 is serialised as XML, so any vocabularies used in its definitions have to be expressed as XML

[11:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But the document using the binding can be HTML?

[11:57:00.0000] <sicking>
TabAtkins: yes

[12:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Can shadow dom elements be parents of normal dom elements, after XBL2 rearranging?

[12:15:00.0000] <smaug>
TabAtkins: well, anonymous elements can be "binding parents" of normal dom elements

[12:16:00.0000] <smaug>
/me doesn't remember what terminology XBL2 spec uses

[12:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, say you have a binding assigned to #foo.  then you do #foo.appendChild(#bar) (pretend this is all valid syntax).  Is that valid?

[12:16:02.0000] <smaug>
er

[12:16:03.0000] <smaug>
not binding parents, but insertion parents

[12:17:00.0000] <smaug>
TabAtkins: #foo is still just a DOM element

[12:18:00.0000] <smaug>
so it has appendChild works just like it works without xbl

[12:18:01.0000] <smaug>
I mean, appendChild does the same thing in DOM

[12:18:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And so the #bar then moves to wherever it's supposed to in the shadow dom?

[12:18:03.0000] <smaug>
yeah

[12:18:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk, thought so.

[13:02:00.0000] <variable>
1) Can anyone provide screenshots/images of what the progress and meter elements are supposed to be rendered as unstyled? I'm looking specifically for pictures that accentuate the difference between the two.

[13:02:01.0000] <variable>
2) Who is in charge of the wiki?

[13:03:00.0000] <variable>
* I mean admin and such - not content

[13:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/applehiguidelines/XHIGControls/XHIGControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359-TPXREF106

[13:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
see also Level Indicators further down that page

[13:06:01.0000] <variable>
Lachy: thanks - I found that link in a slightly different form on the mailing list but it kept redirecting me to the home page of that site 

[13:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, Apple have moved the documents around, so the links in the mailing list are likely broken

[13:08:00.0000] <variable>
Is http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/applehiguidelines/art/ct_asynchprogindsizes.jpg a valid indeterminate progress element?

[13:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
Not really, because usually something like that has no way of indicating a determinate state. It's just a throbber that only indicates 2 states: in progress or not in progress

[13:10:00.0000] <variable>
Is there anything in the spec that would indicate something like that?

[13:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
variable, I'm probably the person to go to for wiki administration.

[13:12:00.0000] <variable>
AryehGregor: can I PM you ?

[13:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
variable, okay, although I have to run soon.

[13:12:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I didn't notice you asked about the wiki.

[13:12:03.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor and I both administer the wiki

[13:12:04.0000] <variable>
Ah ok

[13:13:00.0000] <variable>
so I'll talk to you instead ;)

[13:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, Lachy does too, and I ask him or Hixie if I'm unsure about whether we want to do something.  But I'm a MediaWiki developer, so I can do crazier stuff.  \o/

[13:13:02.0000] <variable>
AryehGregor: I don't that much crazy stuff ;)

[13:13:03.0000] <variable>
Lachy: is a PM ok ?

[13:14:00.0000] <variable>
3) Is there anything in the spec that would indicate something like the throbber?

[13:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
sure, PM is generally fine with anyone in here

[13:15:00.0000] <variable>
still, netiquette ;) 

[13:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
but if you don't want to ask public, then join #whatwg-cabal

[13:17:00.0000] <variable>
I'm in -cabal now

[13:22:00.0000] <variable>
3) Is there anything in the spec that would indicate something like the throbber?

[13:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
krijnh needs to start logging #whatwg-cabal

[13:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, there's not much point. No-one hangs out there

[13:23:01.0000] <variable>
Dashiva: cute ;)

[13:23:02.0000] <Lachy>
except me :-)

[13:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's where I go when I want to be alone for a while

[13:24:01.0000] <variable>
I've always used /dev/null for that

[13:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's all we need, rumours of a secret irc channel when we don't even have one :-P

[13:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
#whatwg-secret-treehouse-no-patents-allowed never really took off

[13:43:00.0000] <variable>
Hixie: rumors? I havn't heard any rumors of such a channel

[13:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
I just meant Lachy's fooling around :-P

[13:45:00.0000] <variable>
heh

[13:45:01.0000] <variable>
3) Is there anything in the spec that would indicate something like the throbber?

[13:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
<img src="throbber.gif" alt="In Progress...">

[13:46:01.0000] <variable>
I see 

[13:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
or <progress></progress>

[13:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
(with no progress)

[13:47:02.0000] <variable>
I see

[13:48:00.0000] <variable>
Hixie: feel free to announce the existence of the rationale page in the wiki - I don't like to see wiki pages edited by just one person ;)

[13:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
you should do that :-)

[13:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
if an indeterminate progress bar could be represented by a throbber, then I suppose you could style it with: progress { content: url(throbber.gif); }

[13:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's your page

[13:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[13:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
you can post a blog post about it, if you like

[13:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
blog.whatwg.org

[13:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
(ask me or lachy to give you editor rights once it's written so you can post it)

[13:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
variable, if you post to the blog, let me know so I can moderate your post and give you editor rights

[13:51:02.0000] <variable>
Lachy: kk

[13:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
or you can twitter it, using the form on the front of the whatwg.org site -- PM me for the password

[13:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
or link to it from the whatwg.org front page

[13:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
or post about it to the list

[13:51:06.0000] <Hixie>
pretty much anything you want to do :-)

[13:51:07.0000] <variable>
Hixie: can you have a million dollars in cash mailed to me?

[13:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[13:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
hey, there's a problem with the mailing... i need, uh, money for the stamp

[13:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
could you... mail me a cheque first

[13:52:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
the stamp costs a million dollars.

[13:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
no no

[13:52:05.0000] <Hixie>
only like 10,000

[13:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
dollars

[13:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
for now

[13:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
1000?

[13:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
you know, however much you feel like sending really

[13:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
can't send you the million until then though

[13:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, wow, your postage stamps are cheap. I'd need 1000 minimum, just for the deposit to get one. After that, I'd need monthly payments of $10,000

[13:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie, can we say that <img> and other replaced elements are display:inline-block instead of inline?  That's what they actually act like.

[13:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
they act like display:inline replaced elements

[13:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you make them display:inline-block, they break when the alt text is showing instead

[13:55:01.0000] <variable>
Hixie: I'll gladly send you a million in my prefered currency: http://tinyurl.com/248jalg

[13:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure, but that's not a notion you can express in CSS.  Whereas inline-block *is*, and acts identically.

[13:55:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Not in all browsers.  In fact, I think everyone but Firefox treats them like an inline-block when alt is showing.

[13:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: yeah, that's a bug

[13:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: you can already express images in CSS... as display:inline. CSS handles it all already.

[13:57:00.0000] <variable>
4) Is there a preferred way of marking http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/applehiguidelines/art/ct_levelrating.gif up ??

[13:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
variable, <meter>

[13:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
ah, depends.

[13:57:03.0000] <variable>
ok

[13:57:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
variable: That's either <img src=3stars.jpg alt="3/5"> or <meter>.

[13:57:05.0000] <Lachy>
are they interactive?

[13:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
<meter>, yeah

[13:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
could also be <input type=range>

[13:58:02.0000] <variable>
Lachy: what if yes? what if no?

[13:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
what lachy said

[13:58:04.0000] <variable>
ah, I see

[13:58:05.0000] <variable>
ok

[13:58:06.0000] <Hixie>
clearly i am superfluous here :-P

[13:58:07.0000] <variable>
meter is the result - input is the vote

[13:58:08.0000] <Hixie>
/me goes back to editing the spec :-)

[13:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
however, styling for <input type=range> would depend on the availability of XBL. I don't think there is a pure-CSS way of doing that (yet)

[13:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
There isn't.

[13:59:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And I wouldn't want to *try* speccing up something for it in the absence of XBL.

[13:59:03.0000] <Lachy>
maybe we could have a new 'appearance' value, like appearance: stars;

[14:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
In CSS?

[14:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[14:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I doubt that would come close to what people want for it.

[14:00:03.0000] <variable>
TabAtkins: appearance: url(...) would help with the rest

[14:00:04.0000] <variable>
think about the current <li> images

[14:00:05.0000] <variable>
Lachy: +1 in the appearance attribute. I'm surprised that such things don't exist yet

[14:00:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
appearance is a property in the CSSUI spec, variable.

[14:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's for things like "appearance:button" to get the default platform button appearance.

[14:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
the other alternative for styling it, which would give more control, although perhaps more complex, is to provide a range of pseudo-elements that are specific to the range control

[14:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
like those that were recently discussed for the meter and progress elements

[14:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The problem is that the typical appearance of <input type=range>, and thus the default pseudoelems to be exposed, are geared towards a single grabber than moves around on top of the range control.

[14:04:01.0000] <variable>
lachy - I must have missed the pseudo elements for meter/progress - can you provide any links?

[14:04:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Whereas the stars-rating concept is typically a set of gray stars, and you click somewhere to make all the star-area to the left of that yellow.

[14:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, it would certainly be complicated to get it right, especially since the range control can differ so much on different platforms

[14:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
variable, somewhere in the IRC logs

[14:05:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Essentially the standard start-rating appearance is that of a meter.

[14:05:03.0000] <variable>
IMHO the opera implementation of range is ugly - but that is coming from a non UI/X developer ;)

[14:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, the Opera implementation is close to the old Windows UI

[14:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
It's looks crap on any other platform

[14:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
but the ugliness of our form controls are well known, both internally and externally

[14:06:03.0000] <variable>
http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/applehiguidelines/art/ct_relevanceindicatorspec.jpg --> meter -- correct?

[14:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html#websrt start of the websrt syntax spec

[14:07:01.0000] <variable>
Lachy: your an opera developer?

[14:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
Core QA and specs, actually

[14:07:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
variable: Yes, <meter>.  Also yes, Lachy is.

[14:08:00.0000] <variable>
Lachy: ah ok.

[14:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, that's one possibility. Though, I would expect the default to be more like this http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/applehiguidelines/art/ct_leveldiscrete.gif

[14:13:00.0000] <variable>
kk

[14:13:01.0000] <Steve^>
Does Opera 10.5 Linux not support the new HTML5 elements?

[14:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
Steve^, no new HTML5 element support has been added beyond what we already had in 10.10

[14:14:01.0000] <Steve^>
then, does 10.10 not support them?

[14:14:02.0000] <Steve^>
I thought it did, but I had to add display: block for them to display properly

[14:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think the only element support we've got is the new form controls

[14:15:01.0000] <variable>
Lachy: jw - why was that style chosen for type="range" ?

[14:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, yeah, the elements will be parsed and added to the DOM

[14:15:03.0000] <Lachy>
so you can style them as display block

[14:15:04.0000] <variable>
is windows 9x commonly used by opera users?

[14:15:05.0000] <Steve^>
why no proper support yet?

[14:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
because that is dependant on numberous other issues, which have to be implemented first

[14:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
most importantly, proper HTML5 parsing

[14:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
I cannot say when that will happen, though

[14:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
s/numberous/numerous/

[14:17:01.0000] <Steve^>
It could always add display: block by itself. But then maybe there is no point, as that style is needed for other browsers anyway

[14:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
There is a lot to do for the new elements, beyond just styling issues.

[14:19:00.0000] <variable>
any comments on http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Rationale#Meter_and_Progress_.28are_not_the_same_thing.29

[14:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
We need to support the Outline Algorithm, adjust the default styling for h1 based on section levels, correctly report the heading level to assistive technology, impelement new Element interfaces in the DOM, etc.

[14:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, fix it so that the images are in their own paragraph

[14:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
also, for <progress>, show the normal progress bar image in addition to the throbber

[14:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
why do you need to support the outline algorithm?

[14:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
i thought i'd removed any need for UAs to do that unless they wanted to expose the outline

[14:22:04.0000] <variable>
Lachy: http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/applehiguidelines/art/ct_indetermprogexample.jpg ?

[14:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, don't the browsers expose the heading level to assistive technology?

[14:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
and also, I think we would need it for Opera's heading navigation keyboard shortcuts

[14:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, re "why was that [windows 9x] style chosen for type="range" ?", probably because our desktop team focus a significant amount of effort on windows UI, and at least in the past, not so much on other platforms

[14:27:00.0000] <Steve^>
I didn't realise a h1 would actually be styled differently by the browser depending on section level

[14:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
but that stuff was done before I started at Opera

[14:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
Steve^, yeah, I expect many web develoeprs don't realise that

[14:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm also expecting it to cause some pain when browsers do implement it, now that there are early adopters of the sectioning elements out there

[14:28:01.0000] <Steve^>
so when Opera starts doing that, any existing HTML 5 websites will start to look funky

[14:29:00.0000] <Steve^>
that kind goes against everyone saying that you can HTML 5 now

[14:29:01.0000] <Steve^>
(like Bruce, for instance)

[14:29:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: That'll only happen if people are currently relying on <h1>s always looking huge at all times, which they almost certainly aren't.

[14:30:00.0000] <variable>
Lachy: I can't find a decent default progress element pic - any suggestions ?

[14:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
People style their headings, *particularly* if they're using <h1> everywhere with sectioning elements, and so they wont' be affected by new default styles.

[14:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/applehiguidelines/art/ct_determprogsizes.jpg

[14:31:01.0000] <Steve^>
When I do h1 { font-size: 110%; }, is that percentage purely in relation to the font-size of the parent element?

[14:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[14:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It obviously has to be, or else you'd be circular.  ^_^

[14:32:01.0000] <variable>
ah, I was looking for one that had the percentage in the middle ;)

[14:32:02.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, it's possible that there are some sites out there that keep the default sizes for headings.

[14:32:03.0000] <Steve^>
then I guess that's ok then

[14:32:04.0000] <Steve^>
So what is the value of styling a nested h1 as a h2?

[14:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: It's possible, sure.  I just find it very unlikely.

[14:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
I know most sites do specify custom sizes, to fix the really bad defaults, but there's no guarantee

[14:33:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: The value is that it then looks like a second-level heading, which it is.

[14:33:03.0000] <Steve^>
but if everyone styles it explicitly anyway?

[14:33:04.0000] <Steve^>
and they'll need to

[14:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't often style the sizes of my headings (though I'll adjust other things).  I just don't use purely <h1> yet, either.

[14:34:01.0000] <Steve^>
A nested h2 then comes a h3, what does a nested h6 become?

[14:34:02.0000] <variable>
Lachy: comments on the updated version?

[14:34:03.0000] <Lachy>
I'm sure it won't cause too much pain, regardless. If it does affect any sites, then the easy fix is for the author to specify a size

[14:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: <h2-6> don't adjust their sizes based on heading.

[14:35:01.0000] <Steve^>
oh

[14:35:02.0000] <Lachy>
variable, you should probably not link to those images directly in case Apple moves them again.

[14:35:03.0000] <variable>
I would find it hilarious and sad at the same time if Hixie decided to be backward compatible with old "new" code and changed the spec to make thework

[14:35:04.0000] <Lachy>
Upload copies to the wiki

[14:35:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because it's too complex, and anyway if you're relying on sectioning elements you should just use <h1> everywhere.

[14:36:00.0000] <variable>
Lachy: I will - this is just for getting comment

[14:36:01.0000] <Steve^>
so if I have a nested <h1><h2> in my article, they'll start to look the same

[14:36:02.0000] <variable>
*comments

[14:36:03.0000] <Steve^>
that's a little weird

[14:36:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: Possbly, yeah.

[14:36:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you're using sectioning elements, just use <h1>.

[14:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Steve^, yes, it will be a little weird, especially when you have a situation where the <h1> represents a 3rd level heading and the h2 is its subheading.

[14:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
In that case, the h1 would default to being smaller than the h2

[14:37:02.0000] <Steve^>
what's the advantage of that?

[14:37:03.0000] <Lachy>
so, the solution is to always specify font sizes for headings

[14:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's just the way it works, because there are no style changes for h2s based on section level

[14:38:01.0000] <Steve^>
you've decided it will work like that though

[14:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: The advantage is that if you use <h1> and sectioning elements, it works.  If you use <h1-6> and no sectioning elements, it works.

[14:38:03.0000] <Steve^>
You've create a problem, why?

[14:38:04.0000] <variable>
Lachy: other than the image uploading thing - any other comments

[14:38:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
You just can't combine them and rely on defaults working well.

[14:38:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
So if you combine them, you just set your sizes explicitly, which is common to do anyway.

[14:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, I'll just make some quick edits

[14:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: oh, you're right, it's needed for ARIA support. my bad.

[14:39:02.0000] <Steve^>
TabAtkins, so basically I can't make a blog's template with sections and have the content without sections

[14:39:03.0000] <variable>
Lachy: good - I hate being the only one editing a wiki page

[14:39:04.0000] <Steve^>
that's a huge flaw in my opinion

[14:40:00.0000] <Steve^>
I don't want content editors having to use the section element

[14:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: Um, no.  You just have to specify the sizes of the headings rather than relying on the defaults if you do that.

[14:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
variable, no need to use <p> markup in the wiki pages. Those are automatic. Just leave a blank line between paragraphs

[14:40:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which is common in any case, so it's not a burden.

[14:40:04.0000] <Steve^>
and we're back to having dodgy defaults so that everyone needs to do explicit styling

[14:40:05.0000] <variable>
Lachy: kk - useful to know

[14:40:06.0000] <Steve^>
that's isn't an improvement

[14:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: Sigh.  Sure, whatever.  If you ignore everything else I've said this whole time, then you're right.

[14:41:01.0000] <variable>
Lachy: File uploads are disabled.

[14:44:00.0000] <Steve^>
TabAtkins, unfortunately if I'm wrong, you haven't said it in the right way to convince me otherwise

[14:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There are 3 cases.  1) Traditional HTML4 document, with <h1-6> and no sectioning elements.  This works fine with the defaults.  2) New HTML5 document, with <h1> and sectioning elements.  This works fine with the defaults.  3) New HTML5 document, with <h1-6> and sectioning elements.  This doesn't work great with the defaults.

[14:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But in case 3, you're very likely to be styling the page anyway, and explicitly styling and sizing heading elements is very common, so it's not any extra burden on authors to "fix" that case.

[14:47:00.0000] <variable>
gnight all

[14:51:00.0000] <Steve^>
If I create my article in a way that it could be distributed, via RSS or on another website or something (which I believe is the point of article), does this not compromise the styling of it?

[14:51:01.0000] <Steve^>
I could not know if the site hosting my content was using sections or not

[14:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
Steve^, it would not be possible to adjust the styling of h2 to h6 elements in a reasonable way that would allow for their use as sub headings, while also retaining their backwards compatibility uses

[14:51:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Onlyi if it's being displayed in an unstyled page within sectioned content.

[14:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, it might be possible, but it would be very difficult to get right, if it is

[14:52:01.0000] <Steve^>
So its farfetched, but possible

[14:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure.  It's just not a case I care about.

[14:53:00.0000] <Steve^>
An article would be very difficult to share in this way, as the hoster could have multiple sources, each using a different level of hx as the article heading

[14:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
actually, now that we have hgroup, coming up with better defaults for h2 to h6 might be easier than it was before we had that

[14:53:02.0000] <Steve^>
but maybe articles would never really be used in this way, so its not really important

[14:53:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: That situation is equally difficult in purely HTML4 default styling.

[14:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
since subheadings will always be wrapped in hgroup, adjusting the defaults so that h2 to h6 are styled based on level in that context might work

[14:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: You run out of font-size to use a few heading-levels in, though.  When your headings are smaller than the default text size you've gone too far.

[14:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, yes. there are certainly limits, and h5 and h6 already go beyond those limits

[14:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I never use beyond <h3>, so I didn't realize that.  ^_^

[14:56:01.0000] <Steve^>
I think what I find uncomfortable is that the default styling and the outline don't exactly go hand in hand

[14:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Unrelated, but I just realized that XBL2 only allows a handful of pseudoelems to be defined.  These don't appear to be sufficient for implementing bindings on, say, <input type=date>.

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
we can change xbl2

[14:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, you would just use a <template> to replace the control completely

[15:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Ah, true.  And just embed the styling in the <xbl>, right?

[15:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[15:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That seems fine.

[15:00:03.0000] <Lachy>
IIRC, the pseudo-elements just allow the page styles to affect certain aspects of the XBL template

[15:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
but it's been so long since I've looked at XBL, I don't remember all the details.

[15:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
but Jonas told me he'll be working on it soon, so I might finally get a chance to play around with it

[15:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Right, they're just for easy access to some of the shadow elements from page CSS.

[15:04:00.0000] <Steve^>
I don't mean to drag on, but I'm interesting - who is the default styling targeted towards?

[15:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, according to the XBL draft, pseudos defined in future CSS specs can also be used in XBL. So if CSS does define new date control speciic pseudos, then the XBL template can include those and auhors can then style the shadow tree using their page styles

[15:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: People who use just <h1> and sectioning elements.

[15:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, has there been any thought about supporting annotations on videos, like those supported on YouTube?

[15:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Ah, right.  I skipped over that line in 2.8, and was just looking at 4.7.4

[15:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
None of the kinds supported by track seemed appropriate for that use case

[15:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: natively? or via JS?

[15:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
natively

[15:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: sure, just use SMIL/SVG

[15:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
linked to with a <track> element?

[15:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
no, as the main content of the <video> element

[15:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
or as an overlaid <video> element, once we do synchronised video playback

[15:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
ah, ok. So <video src="whatever.smil">, where the SMIL links to the the SVG and video content?

[15:08:03.0000] <Steve^>
or I can use sectioning as long as the h1 is my site header and my articles start at h2

[15:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[15:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
(@lachy)

[15:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: Sure, that works too.

[15:10:00.0000] <Steve^>
I assume screen readers have some way of translating the level of a heading?

[15:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The idea is that browsers will expose the correct heading level automatically (Lachy mentioned this earlier as something Opera has to do).

[15:10:02.0000] <Lachy>
Steve^, the default styling is really intended to help authors, especially when working on unstyled pages, to understand the structure of their documents

[15:11:00.0000] <Steve^>
TabAtkins, based solely on the outline?

[15:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[15:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, if SMIL can handle the annotation case, couldn't it also handle subtitles and captions too?  Why then are we adding <track>?  Is that just to make it easier for authors?

[15:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: Yes.

[15:18:00.0000] <Steve^>
head, header, heading.. I think we're just missing headline

[15:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: subtitles and captions don't require as much complexity as annotations, so we can handle them with far less authoring burden


2010-05-06
[18:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, can you update the link for the 4th change proposal on ISSUE-88 on the issue-status page? It looks like the page has been moved in the wiki

[18:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I will update ISSUE-88 on the status page sometime this evening (can't right now)

[18:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, do you remember the original reason why Content-Langauge was made conforming?

[18:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
iirc, i18n asked us to, but i have no evidence to support this claim

[18:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
that variable's problem now :-)

[18:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
yay variable

[18:04:02.0000] <Lachy>
haha

[18:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
If he's going to document the rationale for everything, then I should get him to make a separate rationale page for each feature and using wiki categories, rather than having one long rationale page

[18:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i recommend waiting until the page is too long

[18:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
prematurely fixing such problems just creates busywork :-)

[18:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah.

[18:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's why I didn't bother mentioning it before. I wasn't sure how much rationale he planned to write

[18:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[18:08:03.0000] <Hixie>
hopefully he'll get help

[18:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm sure he'll get help if he asks for it

[18:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I'm not sure many people will be able to dedicate much time to the project

[18:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, this is why you added it http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2008Aug/0300.html

[18:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah, there we go

[18:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
good archeological-fu you have there

[18:21:02.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: why is the WebSRT specification inside the HTML5 spec? It's a separate document format, so should be outside IMHO.

[18:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
same reason websockets is in the html5 spec

[18:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
so, given that reason for adding it, since it was being used analogolously to lang="", I think that argues against extending it to multiple langauges and potentially against making it non-conforming

[18:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: it's part of the web platform and i think we should have everything in one spec

[18:22:02.0000] <nessy>
so are we also adding SRT in the traditional form?

[18:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: ?

[18:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i certainly agree that we shouldn't make it support multiple languages

[18:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i could go either way with respect to whether content-language is conforming or not

[18:23:02.0000] <nessy>
it has a different mime type text/srt , so is a different file format and we want to support that, too, no?

[18:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: text/srt is already registered?

[18:23:04.0000] <nessy>
no, but it is widely used

[18:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh let's just use that then

[18:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'll update the tspec

[18:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
s/ts/s/

[18:25:00.0000] <nessy>
hmm … you're going to just absorb all existing srt and make it part of websrt?

[18:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
not the X1: Y1: stuff

[18:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
and not <u>

[18:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
and not <font...>

[18:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
but othewise yes

[18:25:05.0000] <nessy>
you think that's the right way of dealing with the fansubbers?

[18:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[18:26:01.0000] <nessy>
well, if I had an authoring tool that created srt files with those formats and I distributed them under text/srt and suddently text/srt would mean something else and my files are wrong, I would be pretty pissed off

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
text/srt currently means nothing and there's no spec for SRT, so I don't see how adding a spec that can just be ignored would make any difference to someone who's happy with the current situation

[18:28:01.0000] <nessy>
I increasingly think no matter how we spin this, websrt is a different format to srt, even though it is very related and will be compatible most of the time

[18:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's different in the same way HTML5 is different from HTML4, sure

[18:29:00.0000] <nessy>
hmmm

[18:30:00.0000] <nessy>
I thought html5 was fully backwards compatible

[18:31:00.0000] <nessy>
websrt certainly wouldn't be fully backwards compatible with srt

[18:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure it will

[18:31:02.0000] <nessy>
not the X1: Y1: stuff

[18:31:03.0000] <nessy>
and not <u>

[18:31:04.0000] <nessy>
and not <font...>

[18:32:00.0000] <nessy>
as you said

[18:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
nobody implements X1 Y1 anyway from what i understand

[18:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
the <u> and <font...> stuff will become voices, which you can then style as you wish

[18:32:03.0000] <nessy>
it's a small difference, true, but it is a difference

[18:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's compatible

[18:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
you can get the same pixels in the end

[18:33:00.0000] <nessy>
on a compatibility scale, very close to

[18:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's as compatible as HTML5 is to HTML4

[18:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. HTML5 drops profile="" entirely

[18:33:03.0000] <nessy>
if it was fully compatible, no existing authoring software would need to be changed - but that's not the case

[18:34:00.0000] <nessy>
but yeah, small changes

[18:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
no existing authoring software will need to be changed to output files that work with <video>.

[18:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
SubRip's X1: Y1: output will be ignored, as it is in all existing players as far as I'm aware.

[18:35:00.0000] <nessy>
would <u> and <font> be interpreted?

[18:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
the <u> and <font...> stuff will become voices, which you can then style as you wish

[18:36:00.0000] <nessy>
but unless the <u> and <font> markup are actually interpreted by a WebSRT supporting player, they don't support all srt features

[18:36:01.0000] <nessy>
anyway - I'd prefer we call the new format text/websrt and leave what exists alone - that's all I'm saying

[18:37:00.0000] <doublec>
I doubt that all srt players support <u> and <font> either

[18:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[18:37:02.0000] <doublec>
since there's no spec

[18:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i thought you just argued the opposite

[18:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
frankly if compatibility with existing authoring tools and players is a serious concern, then we need to do reverse-engineering

[18:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
so far i've not seen anyone rushing to do that, so i assume it's not a serious concern

[18:38:01.0000] <annevk>
I'd prefer re-using text/srt as that will make it way easier for people to migrate

[18:38:02.0000] <nessy>
really?

[18:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
personally i think it's fine if we're compatible with what's out there on a broad basis, but i don't have any reason to believe it's critical that we be compatible with the edge-case features like <font> or <u> or X1:

[18:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
that we support <font> at all is just a bonus, imho

[18:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
i originally wasn't going to make it work at all

[18:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
so that there's a way to do fake it is just a bonus

[18:39:02.0000] <nessy>
if you created a srt file in an existing authoring tool and published it as text/srt and it didn't include <u> or <font>, then you could immediately also publish it as text/websrt

[18:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
(we might not want to be able to fake it, as it inteferes a bit with forwards-compat)

[18:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
let's be honest about this: nobody in reality cares about MIME types

[18:39:05.0000] <nessy>
are you suggesting we actually interpret <font> and <u> ?

[18:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
we'll be lucky if we see text/srt, let alone a new type

[18:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
most of it is gonna be text/plain or text/html

[18:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i really see no benefit to making up a new type

[18:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i'm suggesting we interpret <font...> and <u> as voice declarations

[18:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: like <narrator> or <1>

[18:40:05.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: see the bnf

[18:40:06.0000] <nessy>
in the browsers or as part of the spec?

[18:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the difference?

[18:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm suggesting we change this:

[18:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
   voice     := "<" [ number | "sound" | "comment" | "credit" ] ">"

[18:41:03.0000] <nessy>
well, one is supporting compatibility on the spec level and the other is expecting browsers to just take care of it

[18:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
to just match "<" [ anything but i | b | ruby | time | lt | amp | text ] ">"

[18:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
the browsers do what the spec says

[18:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
so i don't see the difference

[18:43:00.0000] <nessy>
ah, so the bnf supports parsing <font> and <u> to a voice?

[18:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
not currently, but i'm arguing we should consider doing that

[18:44:01.0000] <nessy>
ah ok, yes, I think that would be good

[18:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
the question is, do we care enough about existing authoring tools, interpreters, and content

[18:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
if we do, we should actually look at them

[18:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
nobody seems to be rushing to do that

[18:45:01.0000] <nessy>
wasn't the whole idea of using srt as the baseline for websrt to care about existing tools?

[18:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
well, there's caring enough that things will work well, and caring enough that things will work perfecetly

[18:45:03.0000] <nessy>
everyone is right now watching what is happing in the spec and evaluating it - nobody is rushing to do anything before the spec is somewhat stable

[18:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
the former doesn't require much research

[18:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
once the spec is stable i ain't gonna want to change it again :-)

[18:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
so waiting until after the spec is done is an especially bad thing to do if the direction the spec is in is wrong :-)

[18:46:02.0000] <nessy>
what I meant was that the first draft is ready - I assume you will be open to input after that still

[18:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes, but input along the lines of "actually i think we used the wrong design principles" is not especially fun

[18:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's why i like to figure out the requirements first :-)

[18:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
wow, I really like it when bad change proposals include useful, self-refuting evidence that can be used against them. :-) It really makes the process a lot easier.

[18:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: hah

[18:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me hopes that wasn't his :-P

[18:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, the two proposals arguing for multiple languages in Content-Language

[18:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
good good

[18:48:02.0000] <nessy>
well, there are a few things I disagree with but they are not fundamentally wrong design principles

[18:48:03.0000] <Lachy>
I haven't read yours in detail yet. Doing that next. So we will see...

[18:49:00.0000] <nessy>
I was waiting with feedback until the first draft is complete (no sections missing) so I could see the full picture and evaluate feedback then

[18:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: how far we should go in terms of being compatible with legacy software and content is something we should decide now

[18:49:02.0000] <nessy>
no use in giving feedback on things that are still inconsistent because incomplete

[18:50:00.0000] <nessy>
ok, well my feedback is: as much as possible

[18:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[18:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
then let's start doign the research

[18:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
we need a list of authoring tools, a list of interpreters, and a list of sample files on the web

[18:51:00.0000] <nessy>
the alternative is to wait till somebody screams and then fix it

[18:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
no, the alternative is to not worry about it and to reject feedback saying we should worry about it :-)

[18:51:02.0000] <nessy>
but yeah - I'll see if I can dig out some stats about authoring tools :)

[18:52:00.0000] <nessy>
and ignore the outcry of the community?

[18:52:01.0000] <nessy>
(if it happens)

[18:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/SRT_research

[18:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
"the community" is busy complaining that we're not using substation alpha

[18:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i honestly don't think they'll care that much about whether we natively honour <font color> or not

[18:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
but if all their software honours it, maybe i'm wrong

[18:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
so let's find out

[18:54:02.0000] <nessy>
yeah, at least sw

[18:54:03.0000] <nessy>
analysing srt files is a lot more difficult

[18:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
nobody said writing web specs was easy :-)

[18:55:01.0000] <nessy>
hehe, you said it was once the requirements were together ;)

[18:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
this is requirements work

[18:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
we need a video with a coordinate grid and a timer, ideally

[18:57:00.0000] <nessy>
also, while we're in the process of giving feedback on design decisions - I think the <track> element should not have an empty content model

[18:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
so that we can record what implementations do as videos to compare

[18:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh?

[18:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[18:57:04.0000] <nessy>
I think that <track> should be open to be used for media resources, too

[18:58:00.0000] <nessy>
an audio description or a sign language video

[18:58:01.0000] <nessy>
they are as tightly linked to the main video as the external text tracks

[18:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see how that would work with text timed tracks

[18:58:03.0000] <nessy>
and they are as much "virtual tracks" as the text tracks - compared to actual tracks inside a multiplexed file

[18:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
it seems like a completely different problem

[18:58:05.0000] <nessy>
what doesn't work?

[18:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
you'd want an actual second <video> element to do e.g. sign language video

[18:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
doing it via <track> seems like a massive level of extra complexiy

[18:59:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, nice. Your change proposal made note of one of the self-refuting arguments. Namely that allowing multiple language tags has no purpose since it would be defined to be ignored.

[18:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really see how you would do it, to be honest

[18:59:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, I can make people exempt from captchas for adding external links under any criteria we like.  We could just allow all logged-in users to skip the URL captchas.

[18:59:05.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: heh

[18:59:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll do that right now.

[18:59:07.0000] <nessy>
you could reference a dependent audio or video resource through track

[18:59:08.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, that would defeat the purpose

[19:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, no, because you still need to do a captcha to create an account.

[19:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you can beat that one, you can probably beat the others too.

[19:00:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but even if a spammer creates an account, they can then use bots to post links using those accounts

[19:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: but the processing model would be completely different

[19:00:04.0000] <Lachy>
I'd rather have some way of adding users to some kind of trusted group

[19:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, that can be done too.  Or they can automatically be exempt after a certain time period and/or number of edits.

[19:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or we can add other measures, like SpamBlacklist to just prohibit a list of domain names from being linked to at all.  So if someone spams, add the domain to the list and they can't spam the same site again.

[19:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or any combination of the above.

[19:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
it depends how pro-active we are with removing spam. I haven't checked the spam rate for a while, and I don't know if spammers have been getting deleted

[19:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, tell me what you'd like.

[19:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, trying to think of something that isn't too complex...

[19:03:01.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: something like

[19:03:02.0000] <nessy>
<video src="video.ogv">

[19:03:03.0000] <nessy>
 <track src="video_cc.srt" type="text/srt" srclang="en" kind="caption"></track>

[19:03:04.0000] <nessy>
 <track src="video_ad.oga" type="audio/ogg" srclang="en" kind="audiodescription"></track>

[19:03:05.0000] <nessy>
</video>

[19:04:00.0000] <nessy>
there wouldn't be cues on that track

[19:04:01.0000] <nessy>
but otherwise it would be identical to a external text track

[19:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, I installed Cite.

[19:04:03.0000] <Lachy>
cool

[19:04:04.0000] <nessy>
and it would be temporally dependent on the main video - which is not the case for an independent <video> element

[19:05:00.0000] <annevk>
seems like overloading the <track> element way too much

[19:05:01.0000] <annevk>
linking two <video> elements somehow seems saner

[19:05:02.0000] <Lachy>
what time period would you recommend before whitelisting users?

[19:05:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
BTW, yes, making people bots will mess things up, like their changes won't appear on Recent Changes by default.

[19:05:04.0000] <Lachy>
1 month?

[19:05:05.0000] <nessy>
annevk: how?

[19:06:00.0000] <nessy>
annevk: there would need to be a means to describe the dependency between the media resources

[19:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, if we're worried about spammers gaming the system, they could always just leave the accounts alone for whatever the period is.  But in practice, spammers usually have inflexible scripts that will create an account, immediately make some edits, and then not bother remembering the login info.  At least in my experience.

[19:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which is why I think we may as well just disable the check for logged-in users and see how it goes.

[19:07:01.0000] <nessy>
annevk: also, this just replicates what comes out of a media resource anyway

[19:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, are we using FancyCaptcha or SimpleCaptcha here?

[19:07:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me checks

[19:07:04.0000] <Lachy>
ConfirmEdit

[19:07:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
SimpleCaptcha, that's trivial for bots to break.

[19:07:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, but it has multiple mode.s

[19:07:07.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i'm all for supporting videos for captions, but we need a <video> element to do that, not <track>

[19:07:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
modes.

[19:07:09.0000] <AryehGregor>
The default is text-based, IIRC, pretty easy for bots to crack.

[19:08:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: captions? they are text, they are not the problem ...

[19:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually I just had a spammer create ~1500 accounts on my own wiki, circumventing the weak captcha in place.

[19:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, can you check if we've had many spam accounts created recently/

[19:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
We could move to using FancyCaptcha instead.

[19:08:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I can't tell if an account is a spam account by looking at it . . .

[19:08:05.0000] <Lachy>
what advantages does FancyCaptcha have over ConfirmEdit?

[19:08:06.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: how do you deal with an audio description track inside a media resource then?

[19:08:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
But all recentish edits look legit.

[19:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
FancyCaptcha is part of ConfirmEdit.  Basically, I'd have to generate a bunch of images to use, that's all.

[19:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&days=30&limit=500

[19:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: you have a separate <audio> file and you link it to the <video> element using some as-yet-undefined API or markup

[19:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So spam doesn't actually seem like a big problem right now.

[19:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: but you keep it far away from the <track> mechanism (possibly with the exception of letting the UA know that it's a description track for the purposes of UI)

[19:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: sign-language captions

[19:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: is what i meant by video captions

[19:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The current captcha is some basic arithmetic written out in ASCII, any specially-designed bot could trivially beat it.  FancyCaptcha uses images.

[19:11:02.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: the problem with separate <audio> or <video> files is that they are resources in their own way

[19:12:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: the thing about audio descriptions or sign language is that they are dependent resources on the main resource

[19:12:01.0000] <nessy>
also, we would want the same api to apply to the main <video> element no matter whether it refers to a media resource that has these tracks multiplexed inside it or whether they are referenced

[19:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
I would prefer to not use images for this captcha, if the current text based one seems effective

[19:13:01.0000] <nessy>
so, we need a similar mechanism to the <track> mechanism

[19:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
we have at least a couple of blind users in the HTMLWG, and I have no idea how many ever edit the wiki

[19:13:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Fair enough.

[19:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, so let's go with disabling it for logged in users

[19:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: the problem with audio descriptions or sign language videos is that they are resources in their own right, that's why they need their own <video>/<audio>

[19:14:02.0000] <Lachy>
and I don't think we have anonymous edits enabled.

[19:14:03.0000] <Lachy>
So then the captcha is just a one off sign up

[19:14:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, you don't.  Very anti-wiki of you.

[19:14:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's also used for failed logins.

[19:14:06.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[19:14:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you mistype your password, so as to discourage brute-force attacks.

[19:14:08.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: an audio description inside a media resource is not a media resource in its own right

[19:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
fair enough

[19:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: from the point of view of the implementation it is

[19:15:02.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: yes, you can mark it up in its own right - that already works - but that's not the problem I'm referring to

[19:15:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, by the way, we can whitelist URLs so that they don't trigger captchas.

[19:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: playing a video or audio -- whether it's a dependent resource or not -- has a massive amount of baggage -- buffering, seeking, networking, all kinds of crap that <video> currently handles

[19:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: not leveraging that to play back multiple videos at once, whether they're supposed to be related videos or not, is not going to fly

[19:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
We did have anonymous edits enabled initally, but given that we don't have a highly active community like wikipedia does, constantly monitoring it for spam, it's more practical to disallow anonymous edits

[19:16:02.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: all I am saying is that we need it inside the <video> element, not separate - overloading <track> was just one approach that was discussed before and seemed feasible

[19:17:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: there are additional requirements on a dependent audio or video resource

[19:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, on my wiki I use an extension that uses Project Honeypot to deny edits from anonymous users who seem to have spammers' IP addresses.  It works pretty well, we get almost no vandalism.

[19:18:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: e.g. anything beyond the timeline of the main resource doesn't exist

[19:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
doesn't that catch legitimate users out too, if they happen to have the same IP address that a spammer had before them?

[19:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: sure, the related <video> or <audio> would be inside the outer <video>

[19:19:02.0000] <Lachy>
that can happen on ISPs that use DHCP and reassign IP addresses to different people

[19:19:03.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: maybe it's not a good idea to overload <track> - so my initial point is void - but we need to come up with a workable solution

[19:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, well, they're not any worse off than if anonymous edits were totally disabled, now, are they?

[19:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's true :-)

[19:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
alright, I'm happy to give that a trial

[19:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
so logged in users will never get accidentally blocked by the IP blacklist?

[19:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i agree we should support it; i don't think agree that it's even remotely close to a high priority the way text timed tracks are

[19:24:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: only if we design something now that stops us from solving this later in a good fashion

[19:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, no, this will only hit editing by anons, it won't even hit account registration.

[19:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me likes how Gmail offers to translate, from Hebrew to English, the message *that he just sent from Gmail*

[19:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i don't think timed tracks would have anything to do with the way to solve the bound media resources problem

[19:24:04.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: I was concerned that the content model of <track> should be open to allow to add this functionality later through <source> elements inside <track> - that's why I asked

[19:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
I didn't know you could write Hebrew

[19:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyone with a yeshiva education knows a decent amount of Hebrew.

[19:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, if that's your only knowledge of Hebrew, you'll sound like someone from 2000 years ago, but hey, it works.

[19:26:02.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: if we only use <track> for text, then we should indeed consider renaming it

[19:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems like Project Honeypot is currently down, so maybe I'll leave CommentSpammer for another day.

[19:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You really do get a lot more edits if you allow anonymous editing, and a considerable majority are good.

[19:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(but it does require some more review, it's true)

[19:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
have you made the changes to the captcha settings yet?

[19:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I set it so all registered users skip captchas.

[19:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok.

[19:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(except for failed-login captchas, it seems from the source code that nobody gets to skip those)

[19:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: i'm open to better names if there are any

[19:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me thinks this post is an excellent explanation for the need to support invalid markup: <http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2010/05/05/html5-and-same-markup-second-ie9-platform-preview-available-for-developers.aspx#10008061>

[19:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i made a video so we can test SRT

[19:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://hixie.ch/resources/videos/test-640x360.m4v

[19:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
some test cases are here: http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/srt/

[19:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, can you make an Ogg Theora version too?

[19:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
iMovie doesn't seem to export to Ogg Theora

[19:39:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll convert that one for you

[19:42:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: install XiphQT and iMovie will export to Ogg Theora

[19:42:01.0000] <nessy>
you could also just upload it to tinyvid.tv ;)

[19:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
please feel free to do whatever with that video file, it took all of 10 seconds to make :-)

[19:43:00.0000] <nessy>
could you add a ticking time to that video maybe?

[19:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
not easily, but if someone else can that'd be great

[19:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
the 10 second beats was enough of a pain as it is

[19:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I have this, if you want a count down style video http://lachy.id.au/dev/markup/tests/html5/support/video/pass-countdown.mp4

[19:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[19:47:01.0000] <nessy>
the count-up could be used from http://www.w3.org/2008/12/dfxp-testsuite/web-framework/START.html

[19:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
I can probably make up something similar if you like

[19:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
wow that's awesome, takes me back to my 16mm days

[19:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's a truly accurate leader

[19:47:05.0000] <nessy>
hehe

[19:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually i think that's a 35mm leader

[19:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
that leader came from the Adobe Premier content. I just inserted it before my green PASS video

[19:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
but same idea

[19:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[19:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
well the video i made is good enough for my purposes

[19:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
but if this is as important as is suggested, i'm sure i won't be the only one writing test cases

[19:50:01.0000] <nessy>
are your squares of a particular size?

[19:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
and whoever writes other test cases will surely have different needs

[19:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: it's http://junkyard.damowmow.com/432

[19:51:00.0000] <nessy>
I see

[19:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
generated from the script you get by clicking download on http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/canvas/

[19:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
(at least until someone hits upload and overwrites it)

[19:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
ffmpeg2theora seems to be having some bugs. When I play the converted Ogg Theora file in VLC, it can't seek properly

[19:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
although, no surprising. My past experience with getting ffmpeg to work on Mac has not been entirely successful.

[19:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
I will try again tomorrow. Bed time now.

[20:01:00.0000] <annevk>
nessy, at least the way <track> is designed now it is not some kind of generic container

[20:01:01.0000] <annevk>
nessy, and from experience with other generic mechanisms it seems better the way it is now

[20:01:02.0000] <annevk>
nessy, but maybe we ought to call it <texttrack> instead

[20:01:03.0000] <nessy>
annevk, yup, <track> is coming along nicely

[20:02:00.0000] <nessy>
the SMIL guys would certainly appreciate it if we called it <textstream>

[20:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: <texttrack> would be misleading for audio descriptions, chapters, and metadata tracks

[20:02:02.0000] <annevk>
(I was trying to answer your question as to why I don't think it should be used for embedding video.)

[20:02:03.0000] <annevk>
By the way, how is streaming text handled?

[20:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
are we expecting that audio descriptions shipped as text would use <track>, but not ones shipped as audio?

[20:03:01.0000] <annevk>
isn't that all some kind of text?

[20:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: right

[20:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: streaming text tracks aren't supported as designed, though you could easily stream text in (using XHR, EventSource, WebSocket, or whatnot) and manually shove it into the track API which would work equally well

[20:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: actually the only thing that prevents streaming text tracks from working right now is the that if they were enabled when the video was started, they'd pause the video until the streaming ended

[20:05:01.0000] <annevk>
it seems the track API requires some in-out time

[20:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: other than that i guess they'd work

[20:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
per-cue, right

[20:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
what kind of streaming did you have in mind if that doesn't make sense?

[20:05:05.0000] <annevk>
when subtitles come in as soon as they are ready

[20:06:00.0000] <annevk>
e.g. international broadcast of some sports event

[20:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[20:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
why wouldn't that work with the api?

[20:06:03.0000] <annevk>
I suppose you could do some currentTime trickery

[20:06:04.0000] <annevk>
but I'm not sure that makes sense

[20:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
why currentTime?

[20:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
you know what time it is relative to the broadcast start

[20:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
just use that

[20:07:03.0000] <annevk>
then it might not show up at all, if there's a two-second delay

[20:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
?

[20:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
the same people sending the text are sending the video

[20:08:01.0000] <annevk>
and what would you use as endtime?

[20:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
they can easily make sure that their text and their video are using the same time

[20:08:03.0000] <annevk>
I should probably study the API some more first though and in particular when cues are activated and how, etc.

[20:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
end time would be whenever you think the title has been long enough, maybe 4 seconds or whatever the default delay is

[20:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i gotta go briefly, but i've written a bunch of test cases and linked to them from the wiki

[20:09:01.0000] <annevk>
I think the text streaming and video broadcasting could easily end up being separate

[20:09:02.0000] <annevk>
with text being slightly delayed, but I guess it can be made to work

[20:10:00.0000] <annevk>
and if not we can always change things then...

[20:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: if you think this SRT compatibility is important, now is the time to update http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/SRT_research with links to UAs and files, so that it can all be tested

[20:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: I'm not convinced that it's important, so if nobody else does the research I'm just going to default back to what I was doing before

[20:10:03.0000] <nessy>
working on it… also trying to make a video with that time ticker :)

[20:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
k :-)

[20:10:05.0000] <Hixie>
update the wiki regularly, so we don't stomp over each other's changes

[20:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab

[20:13:00.0000] <nessy>
not touching the wiki yet

[20:13:01.0000] <nessy>
also have a day job to actually attend to … in a minute ...

[20:18:00.0000] <annevk>
"Some of the patterns, like SMIL animations, are inconsistent with other parts of HTML5, like CSS3 animations, and need to be reconciled." -- Microsoft joins the party of calling CSS HTML5

[20:18:01.0000] <annevk>
In fact, that sentence seems to imply SMIL is HTML5

[20:19:00.0000] <annevk>
SMIL guys would love that :)

[20:20:00.0000] <nessy>
bah, iMovie just died on me

[20:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I hope they come to the conclusion soon that canvas is part of HTML5

[20:21:01.0000] <annevk>
heh, yeah

[20:24:00.0000] <nessy>
clear sign that I should work for money now for a bit...

[22:00:00.0000] <karlcow>
http://www.la-grange.net/2010/05/05/html4-html5

[22:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
so does anyone have any lists of SRT implementations we can add to the wiki?

[22:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
right now the list is a little bare

[22:02:00.0000] <annevk>
karlcow, I don't get it

[22:02:01.0000] <annevk>
karlcow, I feel like some kind of more specific context than just HTML5 is missing 

[22:02:02.0000] <karlcow>
It just made me smile when I saw it.

[22:03:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, it's not your graphic?

[22:03:01.0000] <karlcow>
a photo

[22:03:02.0000] <karlcow>
in the streets of tokyo

[22:03:03.0000] <karlcow>
rainy day

[22:03:04.0000] <annevk>
aaah

[22:04:00.0000] <annevk>
my screen is not too good

[22:04:01.0000] <annevk>
thought it was some kind of graphic

[22:04:02.0000] <annevk>
also, I'm spying on MikeSmith

[22:05:00.0000] <karlcow>
it was numbers on a parking lot 

[22:05:01.0000] <karlcow>
hehe

[22:06:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, VLC?

[22:06:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, "Movie Player" on Ubuntu

[22:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries VLC

[22:45:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I can prolly do a test run for Movie Player

[22:45:01.0000] <annevk>
trying to catch up with email still at the moment :/

[22:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[22:59:00.0000] <annevk>
aah, it does not support this format

[22:59:01.0000] <annevk>
and the application/x-subrip plugin cannot be found

[23:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
well that solves that problem

[23:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
so far I just tested VLC and it's actually even more flexible in its parsing than I expected

[23:03:00.0000] <annevk>
though when I change the 1 to a 0 I do not get that message but nothing is shown either

[23:03:01.0000] <nessy>
mplayer does srt

[23:03:02.0000] <annevk>
nessy, I thought so too, but it does not seem to work?

[23:04:00.0000] <nessy>
oh!?

[23:04:01.0000] <nessy>
will get to the wiki later today, Hixie - sorry, but I have a deadline to work against for work now :(

[23:06:00.0000] <annevk>
it works with a srt file from Castle in the Sky

[23:06:01.0000] <annevk>
meh

[23:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
upload the file somewhere?

[23:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what's different about it

[23:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
given the results I've had with VLC, I'm going to continue editing the spec pretty much as I was before, I think

[23:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
but if new data comes to light I'll take it into account, naturally

[23:09:00.0000] <annevk>
I can't see much difference between the files apart from the Castle in the Sky starting from 0

[23:09:01.0000] <annevk>
but changing your file to match that doesn't help

[23:10:00.0000] <annevk>
even copying the first line of that file into your file doesn't work

[23:12:00.0000] <annevk>
and if I remove everything from that file apart from the first cue it doesn't work either

[23:12:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe it requires some kind of minimal size to work

[23:12:02.0000] <annevk>
o_O

[23:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
CRLF issues maybe?

[23:16:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, maybe my editor normalizes things

[23:16:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[23:18:00.0000] <annevk>
no, doesn't seem to be it

[23:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe the last cue is lost?

[23:22:00.0000] <annevk>
I think it needs at least 3 cues

[23:22:01.0000] <annevk>
nothing is lost

[23:22:02.0000] <annevk>
when I have 3 cues it works, whenever it's less it doesn't work

[23:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[23:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
well most of the important tests have more than 3 cues

[23:23:00.0000] <annevk>
this is not MPlayer by the way but the Totem Movie Player

[23:23:01.0000] <annevk>
anyway, gotta go for some time, will check the other files later and update some stuff

[23:24:00.0000] <annevk>
(Totem Movie Player is what Ubuntu ships by default and calls Movie Player in its Applications menu)

[00:30:00.0000] <foolip>
what's the X1: Y1: stuff in SRT?

[00:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: pixel-based positioning?

[00:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"Second line is the start and stop time, it can optionally include subtitle coordinates in pixels as a bounding box (X1:left X2:right Y1:top Y2:bottom)." - http://www.visualsubsync.org/help/srt

[00:34:01.0000] <zcorpan>
"Note that VisualSubsync doesn't support subtitle coordinates."

[00:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know of anyone who does

[00:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
SubRip supposedly outputs it

[00:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: you should allow a BOM

[00:44:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: isn't the cue identifier required in srt impls?

[00:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
not the only one i tested

[00:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: it's confusing that ...AsHTML returns a DocumentFragment and not an HTML string

[00:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
although maybe that has sailed with xhr responseXML

[00:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
happy to have better names

[00:50:01.0000] <zcorpan>
which apis are there that return a document or document fragment?

[00:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
other than createDocument and createDocumentFragment?

[00:51:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[00:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
don't know of any

[00:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me knows of responseXML

[01:01:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, for 009 you wrote non-chronological titles strangely skipped

[01:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok?

[01:02:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm I guess it makes sense after all

[01:02:02.0000] <annevk>
Totem does the same

[01:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
really?

[01:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
vlc only skips the 1--- and -2-- but shows --3- and ---4

[01:04:00.0000] <annevk>
Totem only shows 4

[01:04:01.0000] <annevk>
and the initial ----

[01:08:00.0000] <annevk>
with the default font bold doesn't work

[01:08:01.0000] <annevk>
seems that SRT interop is not too great

[01:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it would be good to be as compatible as possible, so that valid websrt files are playable in most or all srt impls

[01:12:00.0000] <annevk>
would be nice to migrate away from useless IDs though

[01:13:00.0000] <foolip>
annevk: how did you get totem working? mine complains that it doesn't have a decoder to application/x-subrip

[01:13:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: sure, but authors won't be happy if it comes at the cost of not being playable in half the impls

[01:14:00.0000] <annevk>
foolip, you need an SRT file with at least 3 cues

[01:14:01.0000] <foolip>
annevk: right, I've had that problem before :)

[01:15:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I think that part should be non-normative or maybe just in authoring guidelines as in 10 years it won't be relevant

[01:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: my plan is to make the syntax allow files that are backwards-compatible, and to make the parser handle files that work reliably today.

[01:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: beyond that, i am not convinced we need to worry

[01:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
especially given the results of this research

[01:15:04.0000] <annevk>
/me agrees with that

[01:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: we could update the spec when it's not relevant

[01:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
but ok

[01:19:00.0000] <foolip>
http://senduit.com/057437 <- test-640x360.ogv with extra time stamps

[01:20:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: feel free to copy it to http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/srt/

[01:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, which software do you use to convert to Ogg Theora?

[01:24:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: gst-lauch :)

[01:25:00.0000] <foolip>
gst-launch filesrc location=test-640x360.m4v ! decodebin2 ! timeoverlay ! theoraenc quality=24 ! oggmux ! filesink location=test-640x360.ogv

[01:25:01.0000] <foolip>
odd, subtitles break in MPlayer when using the Theora file but not MPEG-4

[01:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
theora has eated the subtitles

[01:27:00.0000] <annevk>
foolip, just wondering, you think this WebSRT thing is a good idea too, right?

[01:27:01.0000] <annevk>
more curious than wondering, I guess :)

[01:27:02.0000] <annevk>
the wiki is slow

[01:28:00.0000] <foolip>
annevk: well, I would maybe like inline styling, but not by importing lots of HTML syntax into SRT

[01:29:00.0000] <annevk>
what kind of styling?

[01:29:01.0000] <foolip>
stuff to annoy Hixie, like marking a single word red or in an unreadable font

[01:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
<font>!

[01:30:01.0000] <annevk>
you can do it via the ::cue stuff

[01:30:02.0000] <annevk>
but it wouldn't be portable

[01:30:03.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, appears no player supports that so far

[01:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: you tried VisualSubsync?

[01:31:01.0000] <foolip>
annevk: would that be for all text in that cue, or down to any level?

[01:31:02.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.visualsubsync.org/help/srt seems to say <font> is supported

[01:31:03.0000] <zcorpan>
or at least <font color>

[01:31:04.0000] <foolip>
haven't looked at the CSS stuff much yet

[01:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or maybe that's just an editor

[01:32:01.0000] <foolip>
anyway, I think the generl direction is good, something which is mostly backwards compatible with SRT but forces UTF-8

[01:32:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie tried VLC, I tried the media player Ubuntu ships by default

[01:32:03.0000] <annevk>
seems foolip is trying MPlayer

[01:32:04.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, see http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/SRT_research

[01:33:00.0000] <foolip>
annevk: I was going to test my darling (GStreamer, i.e. Totem), but you stole it

[01:35:00.0000] <annevk>
heh

[01:35:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe that section should mention GStreamer

[01:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
should we introduce <body oncontentloaded> for DOMContentLoaded?

[01:37:00.0000] <annevk>
if anything it should read ondomcontentloaded prolly

[01:37:01.0000] <annevk>
but why?

[01:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it's simpler than addEventListener

[01:38:01.0000] <annevk>
has anyone complained?

[01:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i am now :)

[01:39:01.0000] <annevk>
browser QA ought to be excluded from such questions :)

[01:39:02.0000] <zcorpan>
:(

[01:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hey that includes you too

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me mumbles about DOMContentLoaded having upper-case letters

[01:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me notes that <svg onload> listens for 'SVGLoad'

[01:44:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan, I meant answering, not asking :p

[01:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ah

[01:45:01.0000] <annevk>
would be great for everyone if we just nuked SVGLoad

[01:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: does anyone actually fire an "SVGLoad" event? (as opposed to "load")

[01:45:03.0000] <annevk>
imo

[01:45:04.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: dunno

[01:46:00.0000] <annevk>
MPlayer doesn't even support basic formatting? wild

[01:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. In Gecko, that event has different identity compared to the usual load event

[01:47:01.0000] <zcorpan>
data:text/xml,<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' onload='alert(event.type)'/>

[01:47:02.0000] <zcorpan>
opera says SVGLoad

[01:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Gecko doesn't alert

[01:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
indeed

[01:48:02.0000] <zcorpan>
it alerts for data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' onload='alert(1)'>x</svg>

[01:49:00.0000] <annevk>
o_O

[01:49:01.0000] <foolip>
mplayer testing done, better than expected

[01:49:02.0000] <annevk>
that media types are significant in Gecko is silly

[01:49:03.0000] <annevk>
foolip, yeah, seems really quite sane

[01:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><script>document.documentElement.addEventListener('SVGLoad',function(){alert(1)},false)</script></svg>

[01:50:01.0000] <zcorpan>
gecko fires SVGLoad

[01:50:02.0000] <foolip>
so it looks like appending stuff to the timing line isn't that bad

[01:50:03.0000] <zcorpan>
webkit fires 'load' instead

[01:51:00.0000] <annevk>
foolip, so MPlayer does not display <1> or <00:00> ?

[01:51:01.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: image/svg+xml didn't make a difference in this case

[01:51:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: the problem was that 'event' wasn't defined in onload=''

[01:51:03.0000] <annevk>
just evt or something?

[01:52:00.0000] <annevk>
I remember something weird about that

[01:52:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, yeah evt is defined

[01:52:02.0000] <zcorpan>
weird

[01:52:03.0000] <hsivonen>
interop FTW

[01:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
opera also has evt

[01:53:01.0000] <zcorpan>
and webkit

[01:53:02.0000] <zcorpan>
does svg define it?

[01:53:03.0000] <annevk>
I think so

[01:53:04.0000] <annevk>
strangely incompatible with HTML

[01:53:05.0000] <foolip>
annevk: nope, it strips <1> and <00:00>

[01:53:06.0000] <hsivonen>
not really surprising given the history of SVG

[01:54:00.0000] <foolip>
annevk: but it does keep surrounding whitespace it seems

[01:54:01.0000] <annevk>
foolip, other than that I guess parsing of <b <i> is somewhat interesting to know

[01:54:02.0000] <foolip>
annevk: upload test cases :)

[01:54:03.0000] <annevk>
foolip, that is part of testcase 13

[01:54:04.0000] <annevk>
whitespace preservation prolly deserves a separate test

[01:57:00.0000] <foolip>
annevk: both lines render as "b with lt-i attribute..."

[01:58:00.0000] <annevk>
interesting

[01:58:01.0000] <annevk>
that's how we parse HTML too :)

[02:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
not <b<i>

[02:04:00.0000] <annevk>
but there's a space in the source

[02:05:00.0000] <annevk>
though Totem and VLC handle it differently

[02:05:01.0000] <annevk>
but then you shouldn't rely on such things anyway

[02:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
we didn't have interop in browsers for that case before anyway

[02:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
What's with all the bugspam?

[02:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
apparently the set of components was just changed

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's going to be a lot more bugspam

[02:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
we disabled the two main accounts

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
so it should only spam you on bugs you're cc'ed on

[02:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
which is apparently quite a lot in my case

[02:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
wtf? My settings should have been to not CC me on bugs I filed

[02:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's about 1700 in my case, so... :-P

[02:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
Well on the plus side I don't seem to be CC'd on many bugs

[02:42:03.0000] <annevk>
dinner time, see you guys tomorrow/later

[02:42:04.0000] <jgraham>
On the downside I am still dying od spam

[02:42:05.0000] <annevk>
no spam here btw

[02:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks for the srt help

[02:43:02.0000] <annevk>
aah, it was fun

[02:43:03.0000] <annevk>
haven't debugged something broken in a while

[02:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have apparently commented on a lot of bugs

[02:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I seem to be getting 4 copies of each message :-/

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm starting to get the feeling that i'm getting timeout errors but that the backend is still actually doing it

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
so that my sending the request again with the next "batch" of bugs is just causing there to be two processes at once

[02:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think that happened to me before

[02:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the time I spammed public-html with hundreds of bugmails

[03:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
could we change this? http://www.w3.org/mid/3b09f922ce41a5a55a71ebe12592b5da441fa1dd@localhost

[03:27:00.0000] <annevk>
everything can be changed

[03:27:01.0000] <annevk>
though people might complain

[03:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is redispatching an event a good thing?

[03:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: I think it seems like a neat thing to be able to do, for making table rows or <canvas> clickable

[03:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you can always clone the event

[03:41:02.0000] <zcorpan>
is there a cloneEvent?

[03:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
re-dispatching it is weird, since the even tracks its target, so you mess up the rest of the dispatch

[03:41:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I meant by hand

[03:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[03:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
webkit allows redispatching though

[03:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
probably not on purpose

[03:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe what i want is a cloneEvent

[03:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok there's been a component reorg for the specs i work on

[03:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
everything should be working again

[03:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
the reviewer tool tries to guess the right component

[03:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
and now actually uses complete.html in the URL it logs in the bug if it thinkgs the HTML5 spec itself doesn't contain that section

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
would be nice to turn off bugmail when doing a reorg

[03:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
we did

[03:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
for the two main accounts, anyway

[04:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
not much we can do for individual accounts as i understand it

[04:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I see

[04:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me still has 103 bugs to evaluate for HTML5-fixedness in the b.m.o HTML: Parser component

[04:09:00.0000] <Rik`>
is there a reason to have a kind attribute on <track> instead of a type attribute (as in <input>)

[04:10:00.0000] <annevk>
I think the idea was that type on <track> would mean media type, but maybe that plan sailed

[04:17:00.0000] <annevk>
I saw some complaints about it too

[04:17:01.0000] <annevk>
but type= is heavily overloaded already, would that really be better?

[04:18:00.0000] <Rik`>
it's similar in behaviour to input and button in my mind

[04:18:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, but not similar to <object>, <link>, <style>, <script>, etc.

[04:18:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hsivonen: I couldn't figure out any way to easily turn off bugmail for all users temporarily

[04:19:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>

[07:47:00.0000] <annevk>
assuming you're referring to Map and Endlessly, because everything else is just business as usual

[07:52:00.0000] <annevk>
feedback appreciated, btw

[08:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
Do videos stop playing if you remove them from the tree?</lazyirc>

[08:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jgraham: "When a media element is removed from a Document, if the media element's networkState attribute has a value other than NETWORK_EMPTY then the user agent must act as if the pause() method had been invoked."

[08:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
so you can unpause it?

[08:09:02.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[08:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
And it will keep playing sound?

[08:10:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[08:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
So you have to be careful not to GC it

[08:10:03.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[08:10:04.0000] <jgraham>
Nice

[08:10:05.0000] <annevk>
and drawImage() should presumably also still work

[08:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think this is an area that needs more testing

[08:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah :)

[08:17:00.0000] <foolip>
I'm pretty sure it'll work in Opera, I was very careful not to GC it

[08:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: does drawImage() work?

[08:19:00.0000] <foolip>
I would strongly suspect so, since we've made no optimizations whatsoever based on visibility, etc

[08:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: Even with 0 remaining references to the video except the event handlers?

[08:20:00.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: you can only draw it if you have a reference

[08:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: I can get a reference from withing an event handler attached to the video, no?

[08:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
*within

[08:21:02.0000] <foolip>
jgraham: the event handler itself is a reference

[08:21:03.0000] <foolip>
in some way

[08:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: OK. It's not obvious that is true :)

[08:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
(we seem to have at least one bug related to this kind of thing)

[08:23:00.0000] <foolip>
yes, it's quite edge-casey isn't it

[08:23:01.0000] <zcorpan>
source.onerror = function(e) { setTimeout(function() { ctx.drawImage(e.target.parentNode) }, 1000) }; source = null; video = null; 

[08:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed. If you made it work correctly for video I'm quite impressed :)

[08:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>
consider that to be a video with two <source>s where the first one fails but the second one loads

[08:24:02.0000] <zcorpan>
does that work?

[08:25:00.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan: I haven't tried, but I strongly suspect it works

[08:26:00.0000] <foolip>
mainly because I once tried very hard for event handlers to *not* be a reference, but couldn't find a way, including setting the variables to null

[08:26:01.0000] <zcorpan>
foolip: in my case the <video> itself has no event handlers

[08:26:02.0000] <foolip>
oh right

[08:27:00.0000] <foolip>
I don't know if parentNode counts as a reference

[08:27:01.0000] <foolip>
guess you don't need video to test that though

[08:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think parentNode counts as a reference, but would be nice to have a test that does the above anyway

[08:28:01.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan: please write it next time you're assigned to to <video> QA :)

[08:29:00.0000] <annevk>

[14:49:00.0000] <hober>

Ah, k.  Easy conjugation mistake to make.

[14:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what ocean is HTML5 trying to boil?

[14:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
No idea. 

[14:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
Parsing maybe?

[15:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
It would fit with his earlier article suggesting there is something magical in the transition between undefined parsing and defined parsing that means we are suddenly trying to create a "Networked-Object-Model"

[15:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
(or something, I think we concluded at the time that that bit of the earlier article made no sense)

[15:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure what the bottom line of his new article is

[15:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
interesting ideas, I'm not sure I can fully agree with a native app being a Web app

[15:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think to be considered a Web app, you have to not just use URIs but be URI addressable

[15:05:00.0000] <hober>
which was ben's point

[15:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed. 

[15:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
I suppose the cynical interpretation is "I'm supposed to be promoting android now  so I have to say that native apps are good and not anti-web". But I have no real reason to believe that the cynical reason is the corect one

[15:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Ben's point was stronger - not only does your app need to be URI-addressable, but at least some places inside it should be URI-addressable

[15:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
which would exclude most Flash on the Web

[15:08:00.0000] <workmad3>
a web app should be in the web, not merely on the web?

[15:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that was Ben Ward's argument

[15:08:02.0000] <workmad3>
it's also the classic argument for RDF :)

[15:08:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Tim's position seems to be that a web app doesn't even have to be on the Web, it just needs to link to the web

[15:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Arguably he is allow allowing for the possibility of creating or modifying resources

[15:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
But yeah, I wouldn't consider something that can read or modify the web to necessarily be a part of the web

[15:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"A large proportion of the native applications on iPhone, and on Android, and on Windows, and on Mac, and on Linux, are Web applications. They depend in a fundamental way on being able to recognize and make intelligent use of hyperlinks and traverse the great big wonderful Web."

[15:10:02.0000] <roc>
I think Tim's reasoning would make a Web browser a Web app

[15:10:03.0000] <othermaciej>
a web browser certainly does a lot of that stuff

[15:10:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
There's no "thinking" about it.  His argument is 100%  a webapp by his argument.

[15:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
err...

[15:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/His argument is/Browsers are/

[15:11:02.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Too much recusion

[15:11:03.0000] <jgraham>
*recursion

[15:11:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Out of stack space?

[15:11:05.0000] <roc>
which means he is clearly using "Web app" in a different way to most people

[15:11:06.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Nah, I have tail call optimisation

[15:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't think tc0 helps you when you omit your base case.

[15:18:00.0000] <dglazkov>

http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/ suggests yes

[16:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
theoros: No. But if it has one then it will be used as the title of that section

[16:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
A sensible UA would infer a title like, say, "Navigation" in the absence of an explicit title

[16:02:01.0000] <theoros>
but erring on the side of ~Nice Semantics~, it would be "good" to include a heading (and then perhaps hide it with css)?

[16:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Has anyone looked into how well TTML is supported in e.g. Flash?

[16:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me is thinking of the iPlayer one where it doesn't even render the different speaker colours specified in the TTML files

[16:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
(but I don't know if that's using native Flash support)

[16:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
theoros: Sure

[17:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Huh, must have missed 89 in all the flurry.  Yeah, I'll write up that one.  I'll also, reluctantly, write up a counter to 92, since Shelley's hell-bent on smuggling in @summary for no reason.

[17:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: Shelley did leave the group, but she did not withdraw her Change Proposals

[17:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Kk.  The deadline for 89 is the 20th, and 92 is, what, the 16th?

[17:15:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, browser extensions are not a use case

[17:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: if we add an API for this (which we'd like to), it would be nice to use the same one that will be part of the standard WEb platform

[17:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: so it would be good to have a name etc

[17:16:02.0000] <annevk>
it seems the API they have would work differently

[17:17:00.0000] <annevk>
as I don't think Amazon uses the right response headers

[17:17:01.0000] <annevk>
having said that, I haven't changed much because I've been thinking about whether we can still simplify things

[17:17:02.0000] <annevk>
header names, withCredentials, etc.

[17:18:00.0000] <annevk>
but maybe changing details around is not worth it and we should let SPDY do the header name compression

[17:24:00.0000] <annevk>
aah, WebSRT comments on public-html

[17:25:00.0000] <annevk>
hadn't noticed them until now

[17:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and in bugzilla!

[17:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
"the correspondence isn't perfect;  it's probably close enough that a CSS based implementation could pass the TTML test suite." ... "interoperability is also important for TTML, which is why there is a fairly comprehensive test suite" - presumably not comprehensive enough if a rough CSS mapping would pass it

[17:35:00.0000] <annevk>
"I find it far from ideal:  it isn’t XML" oh god

[17:39:00.0000] <hober>
annevk: indeed

[17:42:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, IETF is meeting in the Netherlands in July

[17:45:00.0000] <annevk>
Maastricht is somewhat out of the way, but it is certainly not Anaheim

[17:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
worse than Anaheim for me...

[17:48:00.0000] <roc>
nothing's worse than Anaheim

[18:02:00.0000] <annevk>
so there's certainly ways to simplify the headers

[18:03:00.0000] <annevk>
e.g. we could have (simplified) CORS-Preflight: Method SP [ field-name SP ] +

[18:04:00.0000] <annevk>
and CORS: "credentials"? origin max-age?

[18:04:01.0000] <annevk>
and CORS-Methods and CORS-Headers

[18:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me chuckles at "nothing's worse than Anaheim"

[18:27:00.0000] <annevk>
my idea for http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/track/issues/90 is either Acces-Control-Expose-Headers or CORS-Expose-Headers in case anyone is wondering

[18:28:00.0000] <annevk>
seemed worthwhile to keep that out of the debate for now

[18:29:00.0000] <annevk>
Tim Bray seems to share the IETF understanding of Web application

[20:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hamaji: if Roland is around at the office today, can you ask him if we are on for lunch at 13:00?

[20:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anne and I are planning to head over there around that time

[20:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hamaji: Roland replied to e-mail anne sent him about it yesterday, just wanted to make sure

[20:48:00.0000] <annevk>
emailed some cors updates to public-webapps

[20:48:01.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if by re-raising dropping withCredentials I can actually get it through this time :)

[20:49:00.0000] <annevk>
it's so super awkward

[21:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: about http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9517

[21:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
proposing link/@rel=script

[21:15:00.0000] <annevk>
that's been tried for like a decade

[21:15:01.0000] <annevk>
everyone looking at HTML prolly thinks of that

[21:15:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would like to move that back to resolved=wontfix and suggest to dude that if he wants to escalate it, he can ask for it to be raised as a Tracker issue

[21:16:00.0000] <annevk>
but understand it's a bad idea unfortunately takes way more time

[21:16:01.0000] <annevk>
understanding*

[21:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yep

[21:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: unless you have something more to say about it that you haven't already said

[23:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
man there's been some weird posts to whatwg today

[00:11:00.0000] <nessy>
whatwg? what about public-html? ;)

[00:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
public-html has been all puppies and sunshine as usual

[00:20:00.0000] <annevk>
except they're not cute

[00:22:00.0000] <nessy>
oohhh

[00:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: public-html's posts seem par for the course

[00:45:00.0000] <nessy>
well, it's obviously like a cuckoo's egg has been placed in their nest - so it's somewhat a fair reaction - putting the spec past them for input before including in the spec would have been a fairer approach, I guess

[00:46:00.0000] <nessy>
but progress is indeed necessary

[00:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would have been good to at least email an outline of the proposal, even if it is still in the process of being written up, and even if it is going right in the draft

[00:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
otoh I think people are focusing a bit too much on turf issues and not enough on technical issues

[00:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
on the third hand, John Foliot filed a bug, which is a good thing to do

[00:51:00.0000] <annevk>
wasn't there an announcement of some sorts?

[00:51:01.0000] <annevk>
and didn't people request Hixie look into this by filing bugs?

[00:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think there was an announcement that he was looking into the area and gathering requirements / use cases / samples

[00:52:01.0000] <annevk>
and the approach has never been to review then commit....

[00:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think this issue has been somewhat fraught even within the accessibility TF

[00:53:01.0000] <annevk>
also, after three years of <video> there hasn't been a concrete proposal; I'm pretty happy Hixie stepped forward and did something

[00:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
i just sent a mail to public-html on this topic

[00:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
there were some proposals actually, submitted by Silvia, though it's true there is no "official" task force proposal

[00:55:00.0000] <nessy>
annevk: I forwarded two proposals from the a11y TF - it's a little unfair to say there were no concrete proposals - they were incomplete, yes, but they exist

[00:56:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah, othermaciej - the TF is now happy with the JS API, but the markup is still highly disputed, particularly by SMIL people

[00:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: thanks for posting

[00:56:02.0000] <annevk>
nessy, true and it seems most of those proposals has been taken into account

[00:56:03.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: if the TF likes the way the JS API ended up in the HTML5 draft, then it would be nice to have some acknowledgement of that, so the frame of discussion isn't all about the negative

[00:57:00.0000] <nessy>
yes, I am happy with progress personally

[00:57:01.0000] <nessy>
I don't think it's perfect yet, but I'm sure there is time for reviewing

[00:57:02.0000] <annevk>
nessy, the format part seemed to lack browser backing and maybe also some amount of research (at least the research on the WHATWG wiki came to the conclusion that TTML didn't address all requirements (i.e. <ruby>) and was much too complex

[00:58:00.0000] <annevk>
/me is not a fan of "perfect"

[00:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think some people in the TF feel that reviewing a proposal in spec form and pointing out problems / suggesting changes may be in some way worse than starting with a blank slate

[00:58:02.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: it seems the TF has taken a step back to actually gather requirements and be able to address SMIL issues - I don't think it's a bad thing, but it will certainly delay things

[00:58:03.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: a requirements document will be extremely useful input

[00:59:00.0000] <nessy>
annevk: "perfect" in the context of HTML ;)

[00:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the "perfect" ship has sailed, and HTML was not aboard

[00:59:02.0000] <nessy>
byebye - "perfect" has never ruled the world

[00:59:03.0000] <annevk>
"perfect" is also very personal

[01:00:00.0000] <nessy>
(incidentally, I am having a Friday evening beer, so take my comments with some humour)

[01:00:01.0000] <annevk>
like some people love namespace porn, others find it disgusting

[01:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
HTML is captain of The Mediocre, a leaky but very large cruise ship

[01:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
mmm, bear

[01:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I thought HTML got posted to a new berth on H.M.S. Good Enough

[01:01:02.0000] <annevk>
nessy, I'm two hours away from that

[01:01:03.0000] <annevk>
:)

[01:01:04.0000] <nessy>
hacks rule the world

[01:02:00.0000] <annevk>
there's also "perfect is the enemy of the good"

[01:02:01.0000] <nessy>
I hear twitter is a bad hack only, too

[01:02:02.0000] <nessy>
yeah, tell that to a researcher (speaking as an ex-researcher)

[01:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
the HMS "good enough" or the HMS "ah, screw it, ship this anyway"?

[01:02:04.0000] <annevk>
in the sense that perfect takes care of everything and will never be done (trying to profile TTML) whereas the good (WebSRT) will work in half a year from now

[01:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
HMS It

[01:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Her Majesty's Ship It

[01:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
haha

[01:07:00.0000] <nessy>
lol

[01:10:00.0000] <nessy>
just read that email, Hixie - I wasn't aware of the process, so was good to understand actually - well spoken!

[01:17:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.osnews.com/story/23258/MPEG-LA-owned_Patent_Troll_Sues_Smartphone_Makers is pretty interesting

[01:19:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah - nobody should think they are safe from MPEG-LA! ;)

[01:24:00.0000] <annevk>
markp should post something again on the WHATWG blog

[01:24:01.0000] <annevk>
missing that

[01:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: http://html5.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/spec-splitter/spec-splitter.py

[02:07:00.0000] <ment>
"Nobody expects the Span^H^H^H^Hlawyers from MPEG-LA!"

[02:12:00.0000] <annevk>
http://html5.org/complete/ -- complete.html splitted up

[02:13:00.0000] <annevk>
would be nice if someone could patch up spec-splitter.py for saner splitting though

[02:13:01.0000] <annevk>
it's a bit of a mess currently

[02:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: just treat the filenames as opaque identifiers

[02:13:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and/or pretend you don't speak English

[02:13:04.0000] <annevk>
you're not helping

[02:13:05.0000] <annevk>
:)

[02:15:00.0000] <annevk>
currently websockets is lumped together with cross-doc messaging and some other communication stuff

[02:16:00.0000] <annevk>
it's better than loading the full spec, but not as great as it would be to have websockets in one section

[02:16:01.0000] <annevk>
s/section/file/

[02:16:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk++

[02:16:03.0000] <annevk>
(both API and protcol)

[02:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: if you have a web service i can invoke that returns a tarball or zip file with the files i need to put the file online, i'm happy to integrate it with the script i have and host that multipage complete on the whatwg site -- let me know

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
biggest problem with the spec splitter is it breaks the <dfn> backlinks

[02:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
i use those all the fricking time

[02:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
I really have no idea why Julian is obsessed with the price of devices

[02:19:03.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, I'm not really sure why he expects a different answer this time

[02:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: especially given that there'll be open source code that does what he is asking for :-)

[02:19:05.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, it was just an aside, after all

[02:19:06.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: not to mention that the styling part, which i presume is what he's saying is expensive, is completely optional

[02:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
It seems like a bizzare argument

[02:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
If I wasn't determined to treat responding to any and all timed-text threads as potentially toxic I might call him on it

[02:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
(just because the potential for it becoming a huge timesink seems enormous)

[02:22:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, happy to host it, MikeSmith makes sure it updates by invoking some script

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[02:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
(the only reason i can think of to host it on the whatwg site is to make the review tool work)

[02:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: FWIW I would mildly prefer it on whatwg.org, otherwise I will forget where it is

[02:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Really I would like whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/complete and whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/complete/multipage

[02:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
or something

[02:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: if you did want it hosted (also) on the whatwg site, all it would take for me is for you to do a GET to a secret URL, which would then run a script that does a GET on a secret URL on your side which is a tarball that I just expand locally

[02:24:03.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: quick q re: ruby text. Korean “ruby” usage is phonetic pronunciation in hangul, followed by kanji (hanji) in brackets. Coming from a Japanese perspective I figured hangul should be <rt>, but “or other annotations” makes me think the hanji can be <rt>. any comments

[02:24:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
could also just use mod_rewrite to rewrite URLs to make the review tool work

[02:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
So that I can guess the URIs

[02:25:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: would appreciate your feedback on that one too

[02:25:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, so I would need to zip the files and give them back to you?

[02:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: 90% of those words were greek to me, but in general whatever the small text above the normal in-flow text is, is what you would put in the <rt>

[02:26:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: hehe. in Korean’s case the text isn’t above, it’s inline

[02:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: basically :-)

[02:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: oh then i wouldn't use <ruby> at all, just use inline text :-)

[02:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean you could use ruby, but it sounds like extra markup for no good reason :-)

[02:27:01.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: wouldn’t that also mean that bopomofo (Chinese) ruby shouldn’t be ruby either?

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
does it get rendered in little letters above or (in vertical text) to the side of the main letters?

[02:28:01.0000] <boblet>
also that line of argument puts ruby in the presentational HTML camp, whereas I perceive it more like abbr

[02:28:02.0000] <zcorpan>
annevk: thanks!

[02:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: it's not presentational because it does make sense in other media (e.g. speech), but like <h1>, there is a clear expected presentational effect in the visual media

[02:30:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: that expected presentation only works in Japanese furigana and Chinese pinyin, but not Chinese bopomofo or Korean

[02:31:00.0000] <boblet>
here’s an image of bopomofo — small characters but vertically to the right (not above) of the kanji: http://oli.jp/img/ruby/bopomofo.png

[02:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: there's certainly a lot of $200 boxes that are powerful enough to browse the web

[02:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
e.g. Nintendo Wii or iPod touch

[02:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there's also the iPhone 3G which can browse the Web for $99

[02:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: yeah that's another case that makes sense for ruby

[02:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: i'm just saying there's no point encouraging people to use it for inline formatting, because then they don't benefit from it in any real way

[02:39:01.0000] <boblet>
I understand

[02:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: it's like how <q> is often not really useful

[02:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
since you can just put quote marks in yourself

[02:40:00.0000] <boblet>
I guess that having the <rt> in parentheses directly after is implicit association

[02:41:00.0000] <boblet>
however, as someone who has battled with understanding squiggles I do see benefit in adding <ruby> even for inline cases

[02:41:01.0000] <boblet>
when you can’t even read the stronger the association the better ;-)

[02:46:00.0000] <kennyluck>
Hey boblet, the "ㄧ" in http://oli.jp/img/ruby/bopomofo.png should be displayed like what's in http://oli-studio.com/temp/bopomofo.png

[02:47:00.0000] <kennyluck>
This is a very weird thing about the bopomofo charter "一"

[02:47:01.0000] <boblet>
aah crap, it snuck back in again

[02:47:02.0000] <kennyluck>
Some UA will render it vertical, some horizontal, it seems.

[02:47:03.0000] <boblet>
yeah

[02:48:00.0000] <boblet>
 i need to file some bugs

[02:48:01.0000] <kennyluck>
This is very shitty.

[02:49:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, someone needs to teach me the zip shellscript stuff

[02:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: I myself have no insight or authoring usage advice to suggest on non-Japanese use cases for ruby annotations

[02:50:01.0000] <annevk>
basically I want to zip the current directory to a file called complete.zip excluding the subversion folder and several other files

[02:50:02.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: heh. ok :)

[02:50:03.0000] <annevk>
once I have that I can add a wget to hixie's thing

[02:51:00.0000] <annevk>
for now I'll just keep this as is

[02:51:01.0000] <annevk>
with Mike's update script

[02:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
bbl

[02:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's interesting that in the whole thread whinging about WebSRT, there is very little technical feedback explaining why it may be an inappropriate format.

[02:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
It just seems to be more complaints about the process

[03:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
I particularly like the comments that go "SRT doesn't do enough for all usecases so we reject WebSRT"

[03:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
Indicating that there has been no attempt to understand the differences between SRT and WebSRT and the additional use cases this allows it to cover

[03:04:00.0000] <annevk>
I don't really get the reply I get from Steven

[03:04:01.0000] <annevk>
I say it is unclear in the spec why I wouldn't omit alt

[03:04:02.0000] <annevk>
he explains, but then doesn't change the spec to point it out

[03:04:03.0000] <annevk>
was it non-obvious that it was non-obvious in the spec?

[03:04:04.0000] <othermaciej>
file a bug if you want him to change the spec

[03:04:05.0000] <annevk>
that's what he said

[03:05:00.0000] <annevk>
:/

[03:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if you think his reasoning is sound, the bug can just say that it's non-obvious

[03:05:02.0000] <annevk>
i don't really care tbh

[03:05:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that's also what Hixie tells me when I ask him to change the spec

[03:05:04.0000] <annevk>
i was just wondering about something

[03:05:05.0000] <othermaciej>
though I guess the non-Hixie drafts don't have inline comments

[03:05:06.0000] <annevk>
hixie would update the spec in reply to an email

[03:06:00.0000] <annevk>
IRC drive-by comments are different

[03:06:01.0000] <annevk>
then you've to get lucky

[03:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
a public-html email? maybe, maybe not

[03:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if I care, I use bugzilla

[03:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if I don't care, I don't care

[03:17:00.0000] <annevk>
not my experience

[03:26:00.0000] <annevk>
seems Steven reads the logs in real time

[03:26:01.0000] <annevk>
good times :)

[03:27:00.0000] <annevk>
meanwhile I'm not satisfied with spec-splitter.py

[03:27:01.0000] <annevk>
could it be that it chokes on the newly added <div> elements?

[03:27:02.0000] <annevk>
it doesn't split on all <h2> elements it seems

[03:27:03.0000] <annevk>
Philip` can you debug that?

[03:45:00.0000] <annevk>
blagh

[03:45:01.0000] <annevk>
debugging that script is somewhat frustrating

[03:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh anne left

[04:58:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, yeah, not really around

[04:59:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, prolly by Sunday I should be somewhat on European time, but not sure if I'm able to patch things up then

[04:59:01.0000] <annevk>
jetlag and general weekend lazyness

[04:59:02.0000] <annevk>
but who n

[04:59:03.0000] <annevk>
knows

[04:59:04.0000] <annevk>
i might get bored :)

[05:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Oh well I have forgotten whatever I concluded from reading the script

[05:00:01.0000] <annevk>
next time write it down

[05:00:02.0000] <annevk>
logs are not just for our adversaries 

[05:00:03.0000] <jgraham>
It was something like it expects <body>[<div><h2>]*

[05:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
(in some made-up notation)

[05:01:01.0000] <annevk>
as in <h2> nested inside <div>?

[05:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, that's not quite right

[05:02:01.0000] <annevk>
I played around with just going through the <div> children regardless of class name

[05:02:02.0000] <annevk>
but that seems to always fail

[05:02:03.0000] <annevk>
I should have a somewhat more in dept look at it later

[05:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So I killed pulseaudio, it respawned auto-magically, but now picks up no hardware to output sound with :\

[05:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
haha. I like how Julian uses the layer violation argument, while at the same time arguing for the http-equiv attribute in the markup to be left for servers only. Nice irony.

[05:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Did anyone ever specify which CMS it is that uses the content-language info for something useful?

[05:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't recall any

[05:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
but CMSs should should store and use that information outside of the HTML templates, if they need it

[05:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I agree, but as long as a CMS using it is claimed to exist, it should be possible to specify which one

[05:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
by extension, it it's not specified which it is, we can assume it doesn't exist

[06:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: i think we should look at existing authoring tools, interpreters, and content

[06:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: unfortunately i don't have the bandwidth to do it myself currently

[06:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, who claimed there was such a CMS in existence?

[06:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Roy

[06:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
This seems to be the closest he ever came to providing details: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Mar/0286.html

[06:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: Does MediaWiki have the capability of varying the HTML it sends out depending on UA string or capability previously sniffed in JavaScript and stored e.g. in a cookie?

[06:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: that is, would it be feasible to run Wikipedia's math content through itex2mml and serve math as MathML-in-text/html to new browsers and as images to legacy browsers?

[06:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: That sounds like a pain for the caching. There already is a user pref for math presentation, though.

[06:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: oh. I was unaware of the pref

[06:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a quite confusing pref too, so I guess we can't put much hope in it :)

[06:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: I get bitmaps with the pref set

[06:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes Wikimedia had https working with the same hostname and path as http

[06:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or at least Wikipedia

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I think it used to split on <h2>s that were direct children of <body>, but then it had to be modified to work with <div class=impl>s and I forget how it works now

[07:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It also looks for <h2>s that are children of <div class=impl>. Which seems like a reasonable way to cover that case...

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, yes, it looks like it splits on children of body that are either h2 or are div class=impl with an h2 as the first child

[07:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
(so it'll never split a div into two parts)

[07:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
(That would require it to search every element in the document and maintain a stack and clone the current stack when it reaches a splitting point, which would require a bit more effort)

[07:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and it takes less effort to ask Hixie to only put one section inside each div)

[09:05:00.0000] <jgraham>

[09:40:00.0000] <foolip>
"Microsoft prefers standardization to happen earlier in this process so developers don't have to worry about coding different versions of the same pages to accommodate different browsers."

[09:41:00.0000] <foolip>
funny, must be a mistake by the article author

[09:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
i support shipping more often isn't an acceptable alternative to them

[09:43:00.0000] <foolip>
perhaps

[09:43:01.0000] <foolip>
if they just want to implement things that other browsers already have and is standardized, that's fine by me

[09:44:00.0000] <foolip>
I just doubt it's true, they'll surely "make shit up" too

[10:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Why is "making the spec smaller" never an appropriate justification when someone wants to keep something useless?  It's apparently valid when trying to remove useful things.

[10:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
"making the spec smaller" is never an appropriate justification

[10:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure, I know that.  I'm just confused that it's only used as a club against useful things, but never brought up as an argument when dealing with useless things like Content-Language.

[10:03:01.0000] <JoePeck>
also it would ruin the market for the inevitable "HTML5 the Good Parts"

[10:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And by confused I mean "I completely understand it, and think that people are inconsistent and bad arguers".

[10:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: because the people arguing for removing content-language aren't the same people arguing for removing the "useful" things, and different people have different beliefs about what is valid

[10:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hasn't Julian tried to use "smaller spec" before?

[10:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
JoePeck: actually we drop stuff all the time (e.g. <datagrid>, for a high-profile example), just not for the reason of making the spec smaller :-)

[10:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: oh, julian.

[10:05:01.0000] <JoePeck>
heh, I know =)

[10:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: i've given up trying to understand what logic he uses

[10:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: i gave up roughly when he decided that the ASCII reference was such an important issue it should be escalated

[10:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: which is so ridiculous as to leave one wondering what can lead to one's priorities being so out of wack

[10:06:01.0000] <theMadness>
The parallels for the "smaller government" outcry are also pretty amusing.

[10:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Smaller government for all the things *you* care about, and larger for all the ones where it could benefit *me*?

[10:09:00.0000] <theMadness>
I left it hanging on purpose. :P

[10:09:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm.  I just realized that I don't specify what happens when you do a linear-gradient(black) (ie, with only one color).

[10:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or, for that matter, linear-gradient().  How silly of me.

[10:09:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me goes to check what FF does.

[10:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Syntax error it is, then.

[10:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm amazed at how people in public-html are arguing about whether we should be using CSS or XSL:FO for these subtitles, when it seems pretty obvious to me that either solution is orders of magnitude more complicated than necessary

[10:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm just arguing that we shouldn't use both.

[10:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, sure, we can define a mapping to CSS or XSL:FO or whatever, and it'd be nice to allow CSS to be used in browsers to style the titles in general, but they're just captions, it's not like styling them is critical

[10:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
we can get way beyond the 80/20 line by just having simple rules like "make sure the text is visible", let alone even dealing with positioning or whatnot, which can still be far simpler than CSS or XSL:FO

[10:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me rants

[10:54:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But how will I get my text-shadow then?  THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

[10:57:00.0000] <dglazkov>
good morning, Whatwg

[10:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, fuck it, I really need to stop responding to random shit Andrew throws out and just focus on what the thread is talking about.

[10:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, MathML support is something that would be nice to have for <math>, definitely.  The current code to sanitize the LaTeX (strip out stuff like \def to avoid DoS) is written in OCaml, though, and nobody seems really interested in messing with it.  There's theoretically some MathML support already, but I have no idea how or if it works.

[10:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can see the preference to use MathML, but it doesn't seem to work, and I have no idea why.

[11:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: it should just default to having text shadow

[11:02:00.0000] <dglazkov>
JohnResig: ping

[11:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
itex2mml doesn't seem to support actual LaTeX, either, so that sounds like it would be incompatible.

[11:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unless you do extra preprocessing.

[11:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although it looks like itex2mml doesn't support anything scary like \def, so it might have bounded running time to begin with and not need sanitization.  That would be nice.

[11:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Except we'd have to make sure that texvc's whitelist matches up exactly, which I doubt.

[11:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Practically, we'd probably have to modify texvc to: 1) Check against its own whitelist and reject on failure.  2) Check against itex2mml's whitelist, and if it passes that too, mangle it and pass it through itex2mml.  3) If it doesn't pass itex2mml's whitelist, render to PNG.

[11:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Likely enabled only as a preference, at least on Wikimedia sites, for caching reasons.

[11:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unless the switch is done with JavaScript.

[11:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or we can otherwise do graceful fallback.

[11:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
My impression is that the graceful fallback for <math>-in-text/html isn't great.

[11:07:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But fixing up texvc so it will work well is the key thing, that's what will take most of the work.

[11:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
There was a GSoC proposal to rewrite texvc in Python so we could actually understand it, but I don't think that was accepted . . .

[11:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nope.  Oh well.

[11:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It'd probably be fairly easy to add a mode that just uses itex2mml and skips texvc unconditionally, but it would be kind of broken.

[11:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, maybe you could just pass it to both texvc and itex2mml separately, return an error if texvc fails, and use the itex2mml stuff with PNG fallback if both succeed?

[11:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's a thought.

[11:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Might not be too hard.

[11:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
People sure are willing to put in tons of effort when it comes to preventing other people from doing work

[11:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
fortunately, they aren't very good at it :-)

[11:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Imagine if all the deletionists instead put in some effort on CSSOM...

[11:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
They'd just delete it, surely?

[14:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"When the user views a 'my accounts' page in his browser, she sees what information the site is storing about her."  https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave/Identity/Account_Manager/Spec/Latest

[14:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's gender-neutrality taken to an extreme, there.

[14:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
People just need to accept that singular "they" is valid.  Freaking *Shakespeare* used it.

[14:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So does the Bible.

[14:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which has the even worse problem that all nouns, adjectives, and verbs are gendered, let alone pronouns.  (At least the Hebrew and Aramaic parts.)

[14:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's hopeless to even think about trying "he or she"-type constructions in that setting.

[14:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wait, are you talking about the bible in hebrew, or in one of the english translations?

[14:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, in Hebrew, but I assume the translations follow suit.

[14:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Let me see.

[14:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Deuteronomy 17:5: "Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die."

[14:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's KJV.  NIV paraphrases, as usual.

[14:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I avoid NIV like the plague for that reason (when I'm using a Christian translation for whatever reason).

[14:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nice and readable, because they translate it to mean whatever they happen to think it should mean.

[14:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some really egregious cases there.  Of course, the same is somewhat true for any translation, but NIV is way worse than more word-for-word translations like KJV in that regard.

[14:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . I'm really curious to know if people have examples of real-world (malicious, not proof-of-concept) MITM attacks on the web.

[14:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe they've been averted by the fact that even incompetent banks/e-commerce sites/whatever tend to use HTTPS.

[14:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So they get the little padlock, or to comply with some industry certification or law or something, I don't know.

[14:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think that basically *everyone* uses https who needs it.

[14:49:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Pretty sure it's law, in the case of banks and similar.

[14:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So it might be hard to find actual examples, simply because the ecosystem is so defensive against it in the first place.

[14:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
We do have federal wiretapping in the US.  That's passive MITM as far as we know, no changes being done to the stream, but it's a definite example of the scenario.

[14:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And in terms of personal attacks, Hixie commits MITM attacks against people using his network on occasion.  Just when they're abusing it, and nothing bad, but again, that's an attack scenario.

[14:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess.

[14:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anyone using a wifi connection they don't own is subject to the owner doing things like that.

[14:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also: http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html

[14:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, very similar.

[14:56:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
None of this is malicious, though, or something web developers have to worry about in practice.

[14:56:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Most web developers, I mean.

[14:56:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Authoritarian governments doing wiretapping is something that a web author interested in privacy has to worry about.

[14:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's not the average author, but still.

[14:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you can't do anything in that case.

[14:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because one, they can probably forge an SSL certificate.

[14:57:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, true.

[14:57:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
As long as they have at least one root CA in their country.

[14:57:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
And two, they can still tell what IP address you're connecting to, so unless it's a big shared host or you're using something else like TOR, they can still tell where you're going.

[14:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which is enough for them to jail you already, if they felt like it.

[14:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but that's a separate security issue entirely.

[14:58:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Encryption can't help with that at all.

[14:58:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, you need some form of indirection as well.  It's still a MITM attack, though.

[14:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And worth pointing out.  If you're trying to hide your activities from the government, and they can get enough info to arrest you or search your computer anyway, then the technology isn't helping.

[14:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
What, peeping your IP?  Not necessarily.  Everyone in the chain knows your IP.

[14:59:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yes.  Everyone in the chain (if by that you mean the path between client and server) is a MITM.

[14:59:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
If they bother.

[15:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, yeah, you're right.

[15:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, against repressive governments you've pretty much lost from the start.  You need social solutions to that, not technical.

[15:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, even if you used TOR, they could throw you in jail or ransack your house or whatever just for that.

[15:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Modern, well-organized governments are essentially invincible to any kind of internal revolt, other than a military coup.

[15:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
True.

[15:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess you can pressure them in some ways, but technology isn't going to much help you to hide from them.  It does help make it harder for them to control information, though.

[15:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . anyway.  Whatever the case may be, any security scenario where you're trying to defend against a government or comparably powerful organization needs to be treated as an entirely separate category.

[15:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It shouldn't even be brought up in general, if it's just a general web security discussion.

[15:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So we're back to (a) open wifi means that the owner can snoop and alter your traffic easily and (b) anyone in the normal chain of routers between you and the target can do the same.

[15:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But right now, SSL's security against MITM and general ubiquity in cases where MITM would be a profitable exploit means that actual example of MITM are necessarily going to be few and far between.

[15:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yep.  I'd still like to see one real-world (malicious, non-government) case, though.  :)

[15:04:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd have to poke around, and I don't feel like doing that.

[17:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, dashiva.  You know very well that it's to avoid interminable arguments with crackpots who claim that what they're saying is *clearly* true.

[17:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
In this case it's about refusing to remove an obviously false statement because one source made an incorrect claim

[18:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: which case?

[19:18:00.0000] <cardona507>
can anyone recommend a good wordpress plugin to dynamically show my latest blog post on my homepage in a sidebar?

[19:19:00.0000] <cardona507>
oops - meant for web

[19:19:01.0000] <cardona507>
:)

[00:57:00.0000] <nessy>
quiet day!

[07:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: I believe scriptless fallback to bitmap is possible for MathML-in-text/html:

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
1) emit each text node inside MathML as a CDATA section (ridiculously verbose)

[07:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
2) put a fallback <img> inside <annotation-xml>

[07:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
3) in HTML5 browsers, hide the annotation-xml node using a selector that requires the node to be in the http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML namespace

[07:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Pros: No browsers sniffing, no script, fully cacheable

[07:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Cons: ridiculously verbose, fails in browsers that implement MathML-in-text/html parsing but fail to implement the MathML features used in the markup

[07:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but if Wikipedia deploys presentational MathML-in-text/html, non-Gecko browsers have a reason to get their MathML act together

[09:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me finds it amusing that "It isn't XML" is considered a failing of WebSRT

[09:43:00.0000] <jps>
hello Hixie how are you?

[09:44:00.0000] <jps>
it is great to see the HTML5 work on device

[11:33:00.0000] <annevk>
anyone figured out the zip commands yet in my absense?

[11:33:01.0000] <annevk>
absence*

[11:33:02.0000] <annevk>
or tar

[11:48:00.0000] <annevk>
not a whole lot of logs again

[11:48:01.0000] <annevk>
last minute mother day preparations? :)


2010-05-09
[19:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, could you just do something like: @namespace math url(http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML); math { display: none } math|math { display: block } math|math + img { display: none }

[19:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That has poor fallback if CSS is disabled, of course.  Alternatively, could just use JavaScript.

[20:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej_, I don't think pharming is a man-in-the-middle attack.  MITM suggests to me that the attacker is intercepting network traffic not directed to him, rather than redirecting traffic to him.  It's a network-level phenomenon.  DNS poisoning seems like a different type of attack to me.

[20:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although I guess if you take a more abstract view, you could view it as an implementation detail that it happens to work at the DNS layer instead of the IP layer.

[20:28:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
AryehGregor: man-in-the-middle means each intended party to the transaction thinks it is talking directly to its corresponding party, but is really talking to someone else

[20:29:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
with pharming, the hostile server doesn't have to ever talk to the real server if it doesn't want to, but it could

[20:29:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
point being, it's a real attack that would completely defeat the proposed hashing measure

[20:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, so is the "corresponding party" a physical server, or an IP address?  Would you view phishing as a MITM attack too, because the user thinks he's interacting with a different site than he is?

[20:30:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
at first I thought the salted hash thing might be safe against passive attackers at least, but it seems to be vulnerable to replay attacks as well

[20:30:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
phishing is a social engineering attack

[20:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . also, is pharming really that common?

[20:31:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
on open wireless networks, yes

[20:31:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, interesting.

[20:31:03.0000] <othermaciej_>
or with malware-installed hosts file hacks

[20:31:04.0000] <othermaciej_>
or at least, common enough to scare the hell out of financial institutions

[20:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, anything that can alter hosts files can subvert the browser too.

[20:32:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
Strict Transport Security (STS) was invented in part to protect against pharming attacks on SSL sites

[20:32:02.0000] <othermaciej_>
since you wouldn't be able to use a fake cert or a non-SSL site on your pharming redirect

[20:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you can also do more conventional MITM attacks if you set up a free wireless network somewhere.

[20:33:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
sure, but subverting DNS is easier than subverting IP traffic on the fly

[20:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Makes sense.

[20:33:03.0000] <othermaciej_>
DNS cache poisoning can even let you do it without physical access to the victim network link

[20:33:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Now, hopefully when STS is widely deployed, browsers can be convinced to not have horribly misleading error pages for SSL failures.  :)

[20:35:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
"horribly misleading" in what way?

[20:36:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
browsers are certainly leaning more towards making self-signed or expired certs look more like hard errors than click-through warnings

[20:36:01.0000] <othermaciej_>
STS of course requires the hard error for sites that opt in

[20:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Horribly misleading" in that they imply that the user is in some danger if they proceed, when with ~100% certainty it's not actually a malicious site.  Since, you know, operators of malicious sites usually are smart enough not to trigger browser warnings.

[20:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
This paper says that practically no actually harmful sites use SSL at all, and the ones that do have valid certs: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cormac/papers/2009/solongandnothanks.pdf

[20:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So while it might make sense to display some warning, the wording is very unrealistically harsh in all browsers I've seen.

[20:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Especially lately.

[20:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Good night.

[20:58:00.0000] <a-ja>
any particular reason opgroup isn't allow in a datalist?

[20:58:01.0000] <a-ja>
err....optgroup

[00:01:00.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: do you know anything of who wrote the websocket client library for chrome / chromium?

[00:02:00.0000] <micheil>
I'm noticing some odd behaviour with that specific implementation dropping the first packet after it's written

[00:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
micheil: file a bug - http://bugs.webkit.org/

[00:02:02.0000] <micheil>
no, I'm not sure if it's a bug or not

[00:02:03.0000] <micheil>
because the server I'm sending from is one I'm writing

[00:03:00.0000] <micheil>
I'm just doing another test, one sec.

[00:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
ah

[00:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway - you might be able to find people who know about the implementation in #webkit - most of it is in WebKit

[00:04:01.0000] <micheil>
hmm.. 

[00:04:02.0000] <micheil>
I've found the c++ source code, so I've been reading through that

[00:04:03.0000] <micheil>
it's a bit of an odd error that I'm seeing

[00:05:00.0000] <micheil>
after the first packet is sent, my server immediately echoes it back

[00:05:01.0000] <micheil>
rather, after a packet is sent

[00:05:02.0000] <micheil>
however, the first time I send it never reaches chrome

[00:11:00.0000] <micheil>
yeah. I think it's definitely a bug with chrome / chromium now

[00:12:00.0000] <micheil>
I've got the server logging each time it writes, and I'm writing out timestamps

[00:12:01.0000] <micheil>
down to the milisecond

[00:12:02.0000] <franksalim>
micheil, have you checked in wireshark?

[00:12:03.0000] <micheil>
actually. I haven't

[00:12:04.0000] <micheil>
I shall though.

[00:12:05.0000] <micheil>
thanks for reminding me

[00:14:00.0000] <micheil>
although, I'm pretty sure the data is leaving the server

[00:14:01.0000] <micheil>
because otherwise I wouldn't get the logging of it, nor would I be able to handshake

[00:14:02.0000] <annevk>
not sure if it matters, but I believe they implement some older version of the protocol

[00:15:00.0000] <micheil>
they do

[00:15:01.0000] <micheil>
and my server is currently only compliant with it

[00:15:02.0000] <micheil>
(I've have code in place for the next version of the protocol)

[00:15:03.0000] <micheil>
it just seems really odd this

[01:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Murakami++

[01:59:00.0000] <annevk>
argh, due to a recent upgrade of Ubuntu 10.04 my wireless drivers are borked

[01:59:01.0000] <annevk>
my laptop is now cabled

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, yeah, he's great

[02:15:00.0000] <annevk>
"It is not expected as I said that many authors will be hand crafting caption files." is this format even in use?

[02:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
which - TTML?

[02:16:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[02:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think there is some amount of it in the wild

[02:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
don't really know how much

[02:16:04.0000] <annevk>
I also wonder if that guy is advocating the IE Team's position on the matter or some other product inside Microsoft...

[02:16:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I do not know of a tool to author it

[02:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
he is one of the co-authors of TTML

[02:17:01.0000] <annevk>
I encounter SRT files all the time

[02:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I imagine this informs his views

[02:17:03.0000] <annevk>
aah

[02:17:04.0000] <othermaciej>
am I right that what he's saying about XSL-FO and CSS is crazy?

[02:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
like I don't think his reply to me answered my questions at all

[02:23:00.0000] <annevk>
in theory the CSS and XSL:FO have some relation but in practice they are quite different

[02:24:00.0000] <annevk>
and if I remember correctly CSS vertical layout will not match XSL:FO (but I could be wrong as I do not pay close attention to those discussions usually)

[02:30:00.0000] <micheil>
okay. bug no more, I changed nothing and chrome decided to like me.

[02:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I figure that since XSL-FO and CSS both have their own normative definitions of layout and both have been changing independently, it would be a remarkable coincidence if their definitions matched exactly

[02:43:00.0000] <annevk>
Even if all the rhetoric was true the format would still be too complex, imo, and completely different from existing practices

[02:44:00.0000] <annevk>
An XML-based subtitling format has apparently been tried in the past, and rejected by the subtitling community

[02:44:01.0000] <annevk>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Subtitle_Format

[02:45:00.0000] <annevk>
"The format has come under criticism, especially from the fansub community [1], because compared to the format it aims to replace, Advanced Substation Alpha (which is based on comma-separated values), it is more verbose and far harder for software to read, write and manipulate."

[02:45:01.0000] <annevk>
"It is also much harder to edit "by hand" in text editors such as notepad. For these reasons, as well as the lack of a generic cross-platform parsing/rasterizing library and mature editing programs that natively support it, the format has not gained wide acceptance."

[02:45:02.0000] <annevk>
I haven't seen anything that suggests why it would go down differently with TTML

[02:47:00.0000] <annevk>
Looking at the XML of USF it looks scarily similar to TTML: http://blog.aegisub.org/2008/07/universal-subtitle-format-post-mortem.html

[02:47:01.0000] <annevk>
e.g. <text style="NarratorSpeaking"> and having <styles> and <style>

[02:48:00.0000] <annevk>
Maybe I'll dig into this more

[02:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it can't possibly have as many namespaces as TTML

[02:52:00.0000] <annevk>
W3C Process ensures those were added I guess

[02:52:01.0000] <annevk>
USF was implemented without XML parsers and without much of its features: http://itdp.fh-biergarten.de/mplayer-dev-eng/2003-12/bin00005.bin

[02:53:00.0000] <annevk>
Its original specification has died :/

[02:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: yes, that would work, too, if the + selector works in all legacy browsers that Wikipedia cares about

[02:55:01.0000] <annevk>
USF is not to be confused with http://universalsubtitles.org/

[03:29:00.0000] <annevk>
Seems nigh-on impossible to find a lot of information about USF

[03:30:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh sweet

[03:30:01.0000] <annevk>
the French and Spanish versions of the Wikipedia USF entry have way more info: http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Subtitle_Format

[03:35:00.0000] <annevk>
looks pretty close to http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/ except with less namespaces...

[04:01:00.0000] <karlcow>
hmmm not sure, there is little demand for 縦組, maybe it is just not visible because in Japanese community. cf roc message http://www.w3.org/mid/p2y11e306601005072153z36897033zb795cf5735f0efaf⊙mgc

[04:12:00.0000] <annevk>
Japanese designers I talked weren't that interested in it

[04:12:01.0000] <annevk>
but maybe there will be interest if it is available, who knows

[04:44:00.0000] <doublec>
annevk, this post lists some dfxp authoring tools: http://blogs.adobe.com/accessibility/2007/04/captioning_in_flash_cs3.html

[04:44:01.0000] <doublec>
I think most of the dfxp/ttml love is coming from commercial usage

[04:44:02.0000] <doublec>
vs srt coming from fan comminities

[04:44:03.0000] <doublec>
communities I mean

[05:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: if you're around, I wanted to ask about http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=438

[05:57:00.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: For Web design, indeed I haven't seen a lot of interests. But with the rise of epub (which will be converted to html5 in a pragmatic fashion), I think japanese books will create a strong demand.

[05:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
true that

[05:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
karlcow: you talking about vertical text support?

[05:58:00.0000] <karlcow>
yes

[06:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
given that most Japanese prose books use vertical text, to reproduce the same kind of reading experience in an e-book would seem to need vertical text support 

[06:13:00.0000] <karlcow>
MikeSmith: exactly

[06:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://twitter.com/richardhoppes/status/13647484566

[07:24:00.0000] <annevk>
karlcow, yeah, with the exception of programmer books :p

[07:25:00.0000] <karlcow>
hehe

[07:25:01.0000] <karlcow>
novels :)

[07:26:00.0000] <annevk>
it's unfortunate I can't read it and have to wait to 4Q11 for 1Q84

[09:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, pretty sure no one's implementing MathML-in-text/html who hasn't already implemented the sibling selector.  :)

[10:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, the example of a quadratic formula from Wikipedia's MathML article renders notably worse in MathML than in LaTeX, in Firefox 3.7.  The radical is too small.

[10:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems the part that hangs down on the left doesn't go down far enough, like the contents have zero height.

[10:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/demo/roots.xhtml looks buggy (in different ways) in both Firefox and Opera.

[10:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(would still be great to get this working, though, to encourage everyone to improve)

[10:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(working on Wikipedia, I mean)

[11:56:00.0000] <dbaron>
AryehGregor, hrm, yeah, that doesn't look very good

[11:57:00.0000] <dbaron>
AryehGregor, I wonder if it depends on font availability, though...

[11:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dunno.

[11:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Can only report what I see.

[11:58:02.0000] <dbaron>
I certainly remember it looking better in the past

[12:00:00.0000] <dbaron>
AryehGregor, it does

[12:00:01.0000] <dbaron>
AryehGregor, 'sudo apt-get install otf-stix' makes a huge difference for me

[12:00:02.0000] <dbaron>
AryehGregor, (i.e., installing the STIX fonts)

[12:00:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[12:01:00.0000] <dbaron>
AryehGregor, Downloadable fonts may be quite helpful for mathml

[12:01:01.0000] <dbaron>
Though I wonder if we should think about shipping math fonts (now that we have downloadable font support)

[12:02:00.0000] <dbaron>
I wonder if wikipedia could serve the STIX fonts via @font-face

[12:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, much better with those fonts, although still not quite as nice as LaTeX.

[12:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
We could, but that would be undesirable from our perspective.  Surely if this is necessary for good math rendering, and Firefox aims to support good math rendering, it should ship the fonts?  That seems a lot more efficient than every website that uses math being forced to distribute the fonts to all viewers.

[12:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although I realize you have concerns about download size, etc.

[12:04:00.0000] <dbaron>
and potentially license compatibility

[12:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The SIL Open Font License is very permissive, and should be compatible with the GPL since you aren't linking the fonts.

[12:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess it's technically not GPL-compatible, but as long as it's used only for fonts, that's not a practical issue.

[12:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, your call.  It would be nice if I could get MathML-in-text/html working in Wikipedia at some point; we'll decide after that when we want to make it default for all browsers that support MathML-in-text/html.

[12:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which will be more likely the better the support is, I guess.

[12:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me shrugs

[12:07:02.0000] <dbaron>
Well, MathML tends not to be a big priority given the lack of support in other browsers

[12:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm told support in WebKit is underway, and Opera already supports it in XML.  So hopefully soon it will be everyone but IE, as usual.  :)

[12:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But no, not a big deal, as you say.

[12:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Especially as long as actual LaTeX looks better anyway -- which it still seems to, for whatever reason.

[12:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Better MathML support is hardly my top priority either, but it would be kind of nice.

[12:22:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I figured out the zip command and can now generate a zip file of complete.html splitted

[12:22:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I generate a special copy without --absolute enabled

[12:23:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, if you need --absolute let me know and also let me know the other details :)

[12:23:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, having said all that, I might have fallen asleep by the time you get this

[14:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Opera doesn't really support MathML, just some subset that can be implemented with CSS layout. So I guess it won't ever look too pretty

[14:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, interesting.

[14:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
(there is even a spec for that subset somewhere)

[14:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
Of course if there was any atual content, it might encourage us to spend time getting good support

[14:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, that's my thought.

[14:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I hope to fix that at some point by letting Wikipedia emit MathML, it's on my to-do list: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Simetrical

[14:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
MathML has a bad fallback story on that subset too

[14:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The OpenGL docs that use MathML for [x, y] range expressions become [x]

[14:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why would you use MathML for [x, y] ranges?

[14:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Why wouldn't you use it when you're already using mathml?

[14:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is the output even distinguishable from HTML?

[14:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, if it works.

[14:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
mathml fences are fancy

[14:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The height and alignment and such

[14:28:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I suppose there are entities you can use, but then you have to wrangle those instead of a simple element name

[14:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
$[x, y]$ in LaTeX gets typeset pretty much identically to [<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>] in HTML.

[17:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
DOCTYPE Decoration: When web designers add a proper DOCTYPE declaration at the beginning of an HTML document, but then don’t bother to write valid markup for the rest of it.

[23:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: umm, right. I got my thinking about the + selector mixed up.

[00:14:00.0000] <JoePeck>
"style sheet" or "stylesheet" or is each appropriate for different situations?

[00:18:00.0000] <annevk>
yup

[00:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JoePeck: as far as prose in specs, the CSS specs seem to use "style sheet" consistently

[00:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
..while the XSL specs use "stylesheet"

[00:24:01.0000] <JoePeck>
MikeSmith: yes, that was the first placed I looked and I noticed that

[00:24:02.0000] <JoePeck>
interesting. Do you find yourself leaning to one side or the other?

[00:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JoePeck: I suppose being consistent with the CSS specs is best

[00:28:00.0000] <JoePeck>
MikeSmith: thanks for your thoughts!

[00:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the HTML5 spec also seems to use "style sheet" in prose, except for one exception (which I guess could be considered an editorial bug)

[00:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I'm looking at http://bugzilla.validator.nu/show_bug.cgi?id=438 (about style@scoped needing to be allowed in flow content)

[00:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I noticed your comment in common.rnc:

[00:32:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
        common.inner.flow =

[00:32:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
                ( text & common.elem.flow* ) # REVISIT <style scoped>

[00:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so... trying to figure if it's possible to express in the schema or not

[00:36:00.0000] <annevk>
good times http://www.w3.org/2010/05/07-hcg-minutes.html (W3C Member-only)

[00:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: or if it instead needs to be handled with a new Checker class or something

[00:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: It seems to me this should be expressible in a schema

[00:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the error messages will suck, though

[00:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[00:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll mess around with it and see what I can come up with

[00:52:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if anyone actually has plans for implementing <style scoped> in a browser

[00:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me would really like to know the answer to that too

[00:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. JF's email to public-html makes it look like consulting captioning experts were sufficient.

[00:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wants two things: a git interface in PHP, and a ARM toolchain including X.

[00:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I find it unbelievable that any consultation with browser developers could have lead to using XSL-FO as the layout basis

[00:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
seems like a failure to consult with a notable stake holder group!

[01:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: HTML5 back on by default in Minefield?

[01:08:00.0000] <nessy>
it almost seems like that first 10 or so years of W3C work in this century was done mostly without consulting with browser developers…

[09:00:00.0000] <annevk>
foolip, aah good point

[09:00:01.0000] <annevk>
foolip, I think language-per-cue can be done, e.g. <narrator lang=en> or some such

[09:01:00.0000] <annevk>
good points*

[09:01:01.0000] <annevk>
I meant more the general picture is pretty good, not necessarily WebSRT specifics

[09:01:02.0000] <annevk>
(though those are pretty good too, imo)

[09:07:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
if it's per-cue, then maybe it should be a "cue setting"

[09:10:00.0000] <annevk>
oh right

[09:10:01.0000] <annevk>
we could even have a generic <span>

[09:11:00.0000] <annevk>
though someone might call bloat

[09:11:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
i think multilanguage subtitles are on the maybe wrong side of the 80% rule

[09:13:00.0000] <foolip>
annevk: do we want attributes in WebSRT elements?

[09:14:00.0000] <foolip>
so far it's only "voices", the element name that is parsed, right?

[09:15:00.0000] <annevk>
I think that BNF is no longer entirely accurate and that Hixie found some reason to make that part generic

[09:21:00.0000] <foolip>
I also need to add a use case for multiple voices. In karaoke duets singer A, B and A+B can be 3 different colors

[09:29:00.0000] <annevk>
foolip, how is that not covered by <a> <b> <ab> at the start of a line?

[09:43:00.0000] <foolip>
annevk: oh, maybe it is that simple

[09:44:00.0000] <foolip>
I'm quite keen to see how the HTML-like stuff is going to turn out

[09:46:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm guessing that instead of a DOM they'll just generate CSS boxes directly

[10:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I'm not convinced that a special-purpose tokenizer and a special-purpose css frame constuctor are nice to have

[10:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
special-purpose css frame constructor?

[10:04:00.0000] <mhausenblas>
hey lazyIRC, which browsers support CORS, ATM?

[10:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: for rendering timed text using the css formatter without a DOM

[10:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh

[10:06:01.0000] <mhausenblas>
any overview/implementation report on CORS available?

[10:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
seems easier to make a fake DOM, if you already have an existing css layout engine

[10:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
mhausenblas: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, partial support in IE via XDomainRequest

[10:06:04.0000] <mhausenblas>
thanks, othermaciej

Lachy: around?

[10:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, yo

[10:29:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, you already have the latter for <canvas>

[10:29:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, and we have lots of tokenizers too and this one would be a lot simpler than the HTML one, which would be a benefit for non-HTML impls

[10:29:02.0000] <variable>
Lachy: I sent a blog post for review --> could you look at it and let me know if it is good?

[10:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, will do shortly

[10:30:01.0000] <variable>
kk

[10:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://glazman.org/JSCSSP/ hmm if that were MIT licensed I could port it to python and use it to implement proper CSS sanitization in html5lib

[10:35:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Mornin'

[10:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although I guess it was ported from Gecko iun the first place so the license is rather fixed

[10:36:01.0000] <variable>
Lachy == Lachlan Hunt -- right?

[10:37:00.0000] <variable>
jgraham: isn't gecko tri-licensed  

[10:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
variable: Yeah

[10:37:02.0000] <variable>
IIRC it is mozilla+gpl+????

[10:37:03.0000] <jgraham>
+ LGPL

[10:37:04.0000] <variable>
?

[10:37:05.0000] <variable>
jgraham: isn't gecko tri-licensed ?

[10:37:06.0000] <variable>
sorry bad copy/paste

[10:37:07.0000] <variable>
can't you use it under one of the other licenses?

[10:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
I could _use_ it under LGPL, sure

[10:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
But derivatives would have to be LGPL also, I guess

[10:38:02.0000] <variable>
true

[10:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
so I couldn't incoroprate the whole thing into an MIT licensed project and keep the MIT license

[10:40:00.0000] <variable>
jgraham: ah I see - damn gpl

[10:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well I don't really have anything aginst the LGPL. It just doesn't work for me in this case

[10:42:01.0000] <variable>
jgraham: in general I don't like the gpl for exactly this reason ;)

[10:42:02.0000] <variable>
I thought for a moment that one of  the licenses was MIT/BSD - thats all

[11:09:00.0000] <Aleoss>
What is the compatibility of application/rss+xml VS application/atom+xml VS text/xml for a feed?

[11:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, published

[11:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
variable, you've been upgraded to Author. You can now publish without moderation

[11:16:00.0000] <Aleoss>
Should it be text/xml or application/xml? They are both valid MIME types under RFC3023 but which is the technically correct method?

[11:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Aleoss: text/xml apparently has weird charset requirements, so application/xml is likely to be less confusing and/or less wrong

[11:22:00.0000] <Aleoss>
Thanks.

[11:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
(...though if you're using it for e.g. XHTML then you should probably use application/xhtml+xml instead because that's more conventional)

[11:42:00.0000] <oal>
Is this the html5 channel?

[11:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
oal: Yes

[11:43:00.0000] <oal>
I'm trying to make use of the Canvas element for massive amounts of text

[11:43:01.0000] <oal>
And I want to color certain words as I type

[11:43:02.0000] <oal>
Do I have to redraw the whole canvas to avoid getting double letters?

[11:44:00.0000] <oal>
And are there any good, in depth docs on the canvas element yet?

[11:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you want to dynamically update a small region of the canvas, you could do a clearRect and then set a clipping rectangle and then draw the next text into that area

[11:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
(though it's hard to know precisely what rectangle to update since you don't know the precise font metrics)

[11:50:01.0000] <oal>
Hmm, if I use say a monospaced font in a given size at all times?

[11:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
(but it should be possible to make a reasonable overestimate)

[11:51:00.0000] <oal>
Philip`, if I do use clearRect etc, will that area be the only space redrawn, leaving the rest untouched?

[11:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
/me reads about using two iPads to multitask. Loses faith in humanity.

[11:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me assumes that you really need canvas and that you wouln't be better off doing the text with some retained mode feature like er, well HTML, or SVG

[11:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Now that is a business model

[11:52:02.0000] <oal>
I'd like to use canvas to learn something new, other than that, I don't have to ;)

[11:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
oal: If you do clearRect(x,y,w,h); save(); rect(x,y,w,h); clip(); /* draw stuff */; restore(); then it will only draw into the given rectangle and won't affect anything outside there

[11:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe the next version of the OS will allow you to wirelessly copy + paste between multiple iPads :)

[11:53:02.0000] <oal>
Philip`, which will then be a lot faster? :)

[11:53:03.0000] <oal>
with massive amounts of text

[11:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Someone should make an app that displays the clipboard as one of those funny pixel grid things, so an app on the other iPad can use a camera to pick up the data and move it into its own clipboard

[11:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
That would be awesome

[11:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
oal: It probably wouldn't be much faster if you're redrawing all the text, but you can write some high-level code to only redraw the lines that you want

[11:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
so you're not trying to draw massive amounts of text each time

[11:56:00.0000] <oal>
But wouldn't your example above only redraw the region specified?

[11:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you draw some text which is outside the clipping region, the browser would still have to process all the characters and turn them into glyph shapes and see if they're inside the clipping region

[11:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
so you only save the cost of converting the glyph shapes into pixels

[11:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
(probably)

[11:58:03.0000] <Philip`>
so it's faster if you don't attempt to draw the text at all

[11:58:04.0000] <oal>
Ok, I see

[11:59:00.0000] <oal>
Say I wanted to erase some text again, could I use clearRect then, where the characters I want to remove are?

[12:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes, if you know where they are

[12:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
You have to be careful about stuff like other characters extending into the space used by the characters you want to delete

[12:00:02.0000] <oal>
Thanks, Philip`. I'll go get my hands dirty with some coding ;)

[12:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
or vice versa

[12:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
so you probably need to clear some larger region around the text to delete, and then redraw the text you don't want to delete (clipped to that region) to fill in any bits that got cut off

[12:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
Using HTML for all of this is much easier, of course ;-)

[12:02:00.0000] <oal>
Hmm, it probably is. Maybe I should do most of it in traditional html and some of the fancy parts with canvas?

[12:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Depends on what you're doing

[12:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
and whether the benefit of using the most appropriate technologies for each part of your system is greater than the pain of integrating multiple technologies

[12:05:00.0000] <oal>
I'll do some prototyping with both, and see what's easiest and most efficient

[12:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also don't forget SVG

[12:06:01.0000] <oal>
Haven't been working with svg  other than with InkScape

[12:06:02.0000] <oal>
What are the advantages of using SVG?

[12:06:03.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like an opportunity to learn something new :-)

[12:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
The advantages depend on what you're doing :-p

[12:07:01.0000] <oal>
Yes, of course. I'll definitely look into it. :)

[12:07:02.0000] <oal>
Summer is coming and lots of spare time, so it's good to have some plans

[12:07:03.0000] <Philip`>
It's more graphical than HTML and less procedural than canvas

[12:07:04.0000] <Philip`>
so it might be good if that's what you want

[12:08:00.0000] <oal>
Can you for example give names to boxes and control them later, rather than having to redraw the whole canvas to move one object?

[12:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[12:08:02.0000] <oal>
That's convenient

[12:08:03.0000] <Philip`>
Indeed

[12:10:00.0000] <oal>
Any websites with SVG examples? I found this for canvas http://www.canvasdemos.com/

[12:49:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So now that HTML5 allows embed again, should we be using it for flash?

[12:50:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Or should flash stay in <object>?

[12:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
You shouldn't be using Flash

[12:55:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Philip`, I know.

[13:11:00.0000] <Aleoss>
Philip: That is a niave thing to say. Think of websites like YouTube and NewGrounds and IllWillPress and HomeStarRunner and what not? Those sites people go to knowing that it is flash/shockwave content on.

[13:18:00.0000] <Aleoss>
Fact: Javascript executes faster than HTML5 Canvas drawing does.

[13:19:00.0000] <Aleoss>
The odd thing about it: HTML5 Canvas uses Javascript to do it's functions.

[13:20:00.0000] <Aleoss>
Proof: http://webroo.org/2010/01/17/html-5-canvas-vs-flash/

[13:20:01.0000] <Aleoss>
Correction: That is the flash one.

[13:20:02.0000] <Aleoss>
Flash does execute faster as well.

[13:21:00.0000] <Aleoss>
But to draw a line via JS is faster than drawing a line on a <canvas> element.

[13:29:00.0000] <annevk>
You do know YouTube is planning on switching to using <video> right?

[17:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The page shoots itself in the foot by having "attacks" that require the attacker to be able to create on* attributes already

[17:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sounds like "When we add new attributes, people who were blacklisting attributes are screwed".

[17:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
<video poster> sounds like a sneaky one, though, you'd expect someone might fall for that.  Does javascript: work for <img src>?

[17:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Don't think so. Don't see why it should work for poster either.

[17:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Looks like it's just a bug in Opera

[17:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
All the other cases require that the attacker already can write arbitrary markup, so I guess that's 0 new attacks

[17:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
As usual.

[21:22:00.0000] <wirepair>
besides the sandbox attribute, does anyone see/know of anything in html5 that will help increase security/make it easier for developers to create secure apps?

[21:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
wirepair: security features are baked in from the ground up, so it's hard to point to them

[22:18:00.0000] <wirepair>
hixie yeah

[22:19:00.0000] <wirepair>
just wondered if something additional like sandbox would provide developers with the ability to secure their web apps

[22:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
wirepair: there's things like the Origin header

[22:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
wirepair: might be some other features here and there

[22:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
wirepair: generally the idea is to make it automatic that things be secure, though

burning CPU cycles for the glory of computing :p

[00:23:00.0000] <annevk>
What's also interesting about this CORS thing is that e.g. WebSocket has exactly the same semantics...

[00:41:00.0000] <franksalim>
annevk, a consistent security models is good

[00:41:01.0000] <franksalim>
*model

[00:42:00.0000] <annevk>
Indeed, but people argue against CORS but not against WebSocket

[00:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
lots of people arguing against websocket for other reasons

[00:42:02.0000] <franksalim>
they don't argue against websocket?

[00:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
we already have enough arguments thanks :-)

[00:43:00.0000] <franksalim>
hmm yes

[00:43:01.0000] <annevk>
would be a nice way to get them off my lawn :p

[00:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll send you some of mine!

[00:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
mutually assured destruction!

[00:46:00.0000] <annevk>
heh

[00:46:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, you have some time for the complete.html thingy now?

[00:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure, now's a good time

[00:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
'sup

[00:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hello Hixie

[00:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
hey othermaciej 

[00:47:02.0000] <annevk>
I guess you want to have the copy without the absolute URLs

[00:47:03.0000] <annevk>
and I'm generating the zip file already

[00:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
so long as it works, i don't mind if they're absolute or not

[00:48:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess I just need to give you a URL and you need to give one to me

[00:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess ping /specs/web-apps/current-work/do-multipage-complete-update

[00:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
what should i fetch?

[00:49:01.0000] <annevk>
http://html5.org/complete/whatwg.org/complete.zip

[00:50:00.0000] <annevk>
just doing a wget on that URL works I suppose?

[00:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[00:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
or will, once i've written the script

[00:56:00.0000] <annevk>
I pm'ed the generate URL

[00:56:01.0000] <annevk>
pm'd even

[00:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[00:57:01.0000] <annevk>
I guess once that is all set up MikeSmith can remove the mailing list hook

[00:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yep

[00:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
just lemme know when to flip the switch

[02:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders if Richard Clark is on IRC

[02:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me gets his script all confused

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, hah, http://library.gnome.org/users/palimpsest/stable/advanced.html.en is brilliant

[02:44:00.0000] <annevk>
http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2010/05/11/fennec-meta-viewport.html -- '<meta name="viewport"> is a good example of browsers innovating exactly how Sachin Agarwal thinks they should.'

[02:44:01.0000] <annevk>
it's also pretty ugly

[02:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
and a layering violation

[02:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: supported by 3 of the top 4 engines. time to bite the bullet and spec it.

[02:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's anne's problem

[02:50:00.0000] <annevk>
not really, someone can write a standalone spec for it and add it to the metaextensions wiki

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, finally got the multipage scripts figured out

[02:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
man i caused a lot of damage while doing that

[02:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/opera-mobile-10-for-nokia-n900-n800-n810-maemo-standards-support says Opera on desktop support SQL database

[02:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
didn't we know that?

[02:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I didn't.

[02:55:03.0000] <hsivonen>
does it use sqlite?

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
i assume so

[02:56:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
yes it does

[02:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[02:57:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://my.opera.com/core/blog/2010/03/03/persistent-client-side-storage-for-your-persistent-needs

[02:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
a bit odd not to have it on Maemo if you have it on desktop, considering WebKit's competitive position in the mobile space

[02:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so Maemo now has 3 of the top 4 browser engines available

[02:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess that's the broadest coverage for any mobile platform now that Gecko for Windows Mobile was discontinued

[03:27:00.0000] <roc>
I just read that Sachin Agarwal blog post and my head exploded

[03:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: the post has been pretty successful at getting attention

[03:34:01.0000] <roc>
sure

[03:36:00.0000] <roc>
outrageous posts get attention

[03:42:00.0000] <karlcow>
well I guess jetlag is at least good for data mining/archeology. 

[03:42:01.0000] <annevk>
finally figured out how to get more sensible pages out of spec splitter

[03:42:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, maybe you should rename the id crossDocumentMessaging as it is not a very nice or consistent page name

[03:43:00.0000] <karlcow>
the first mention of srt, I found on public-html is sept 2008 by Lachlan

[03:46:00.0000] <annevk>
isn't John Foliot effectively asking for addition there?

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk>
"then clear instruction and specifications on how to 'in-code' provide the out-band solution must also be provided"

[03:47:01.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: yep

[03:48:00.0000] <annevk>
fun stuff

[04:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so Opera on Maemo has about zero platform integration. not even low-hanging fruit like right icon in the right menu

[04:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but the responsiveness and graphics speed is really impressive

[04:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
on N800

[04:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: done

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk>
cool

[04:13:01.0000] <annevk>
btw, I now have enough understanding of spec-splitter.py that I can create whatever split people desire

[04:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[04:14:01.0000] <annevk>
for everyone who didn't know yet: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/

[04:14:02.0000] <annevk>
and when that copy is down: http://html5.org/complete/

[04:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like the reviewer script is dead on the whatwg copy there

[04:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
wonder what's up with that

[04:15:02.0000] <annevk>
hmm, maybe I should use absolute links after all?

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
aha, no

[04:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
problem with fixBrokenLink()

[04:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
aha, no link-fixup.js

[04:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
you have to include one of those in the zipfile, i think

[04:17:00.0000] <annevk>
can't you make the links absolute?

[04:17:01.0000] <annevk>
i mean like /path-to-script

[04:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
the scripts are absoute

[04:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
absolute

[04:17:04.0000] <karlcow>
/me had a very brief image of annevk dancing at the Bolchoi and doing a split

[04:17:05.0000] <Lachy>
oh, nice multipage complete version. That could be useful, though I'll stick with single page.

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
but you need to include a link-fixup.js specially designed for complete/'s structure

[04:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
equivalent to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/link-fixup.js

[04:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
which apparently uses http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/fragment-links.js

[04:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
both are provided by philip

[04:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
in his tarball

[04:19:00.0000] <annevk>
ah

[04:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem is that script is invokes before init()

[04:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
so if that script fails, init() never runs

[04:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
and the other scripts don't get loaded

[04:23:00.0000] <annevk>
thanks

[04:23:01.0000] <annevk>
hopefully fixed

[04:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[04:30:00.0000] <annevk>
removed the script on html5.org/complete as it doesn't work due to cross-origin issues

[04:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
some will work

[04:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
others not so much

[04:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
does dfn.js not worm in ff?

[04:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
or did i break it?

[04:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i broke it

[04:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
nm

[05:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the notion of whitespace is such a mess

[05:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems various places in Gecko agree that space, \t and \n are whitespace

[05:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
\r, \f and \v depend

[05:48:03.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh

[05:48:04.0000] <hsivonen>
and don't get me started about XML 1.1

[05:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: why does area coords parsing in HTML5 treat only space as a delimiter (not tab, newline, etc.)?

[05:55:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: iirc for ie compat, but i'm not 100% sure

[05:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: What do Opera and WebKit do?

[05:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Gecko accepts even \v!

[05:57:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: opera implements the spec, or possibly an earlier version of the spec where there was no special treatment for funny characters or something

[05:57:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: don't remember what webkit does

[05:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: ok

[05:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'll file this away, because these other whitespace bugs are distracting me from the whitespace bug I'm trying to fix

[05:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0079.html ?

[05:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Filed as https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=565031

[06:00:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i don't mind changing the spec wrt whitespace in coords

[06:39:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, isn't XML 1.1 dead?

[06:45:00.0000] <annevk>
I wonder why the chairs are so vocal about splitting... I guess there was some backchannel chatter

[06:51:00.0000] <nessy>
 annevk: I think it has a lot to do with keeping the choice of external text format independent of HTML5

[06:52:00.0000] <nessy>
png, jpeg, ogg, mpeg4 - none of these are specified as part of HTML5

[06:52:01.0000] <nessy>
and nor should they by - there may be better formats in the future that the video, audio and img elements will have to support!

[06:53:00.0000] <nessy>
it's really the same for external text associations for video and audio and a format definition should not be inside the spec

[06:54:00.0000] <annevk>
text/cache-manifest is in HTML5

[06:54:01.0000] <annevk>
as are text/ping, text/html-sandboxed, application/microdata+json

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Has anyone argued that it *should* be defined in the HTML5 document? (rather than arguing that it doesn't matter where the text exists for now and it's a waste of effort to worry about it before we even know whether it's a good enough solution that it should continue to exist)

[06:55:01.0000] <annevk>
Ian has

[06:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[06:56:01.0000] <nessy>
annevk: are those supposed to be used outside the Web by other apps, too?

[06:57:00.0000] <annevk>
nessy, whether there will be better formats in the future is somewhat orthogonal to where formats are specified

[06:57:01.0000] <nessy>
not if the only format that is acceptable is the one inside the spec

[06:57:02.0000] <erlehmann>
nessy, at least where the consensus is clear — with the img element — it would be good to document it. after all, png, gif, jpeg ARE all supported in almost every browser.

[06:58:00.0000] <annevk>
if we want to make more formats acceptable we change the spec

[06:58:01.0000] <erlehmann>
without baseline formats you get compatibility nightmares

[06:58:02.0000] <erlehmann>
what annevk said.

[06:58:03.0000] <nessy>
you can call a format a baseline format without having it specified inside the spec

[06:58:04.0000] <nessy>
we wouldn't include the theora specification into html5, either, to make it a baseline format

[06:59:00.0000] <erlehmann>
nessy, how would an implementor know then if it isn't included ?

[06:59:01.0000] <nessy>
a mere sentence that this is the baseline format and a link to its specification would be completely sufficient

[07:00:00.0000] <nessy>
honestly, my mind boggles at the sheer idea that somebody implementing support for WebSRT in their desktop captioning application has to deal with the whole HTML5 spec!

[07:00:01.0000] <annevk>
why would they have to deal with the whole spec?

[07:01:00.0000] <nessy>
because as it's part of the HTML5 spec, how will they know there is nothing in the rest of the spec that is not relevant to their implementation

[07:01:01.0000] <annevk>
also these are not the reasons brought forward for splitting

[07:01:02.0000] <nessy>
they are my reasons

[07:01:03.0000] <annevk>
sure

[07:01:04.0000] <nessy>
and I have brought them forward

[07:02:00.0000] <annevk>
sure

[07:02:01.0000] <annevk>
but they are not what started this IRC thread :)

[07:02:02.0000] <nessy>
oh!

[07:02:03.0000] <annevk>
anyway, it seems that simply reading the WebSRT section should give them all the answers

[07:03:00.0000] <nessy>
seems I have to keep up with the spec reading!

[07:04:00.0000] <annevk>
e.g. text/cache-manifest might get separate tool support as well

[07:05:00.0000] <annevk>
it's pretty easy to just read the part on text/cache-manifest to figure out how to construct such files and how to read them (e.g. if you write some kind of optimization tool)

[07:05:01.0000] <annevk>
some definitions are reused but they are all clearly hyperlinked

[07:06:00.0000] <annevk>
I don't really see what all the fuss is about; it mostly seems a lot of hand waving without much clear scenarios

[07:08:00.0000] <nessy>
look at it this way: software is not written as one big main function either - stuff that is reused elsewhere is split into libraries - WebSRT is a "library" for me

[07:09:00.0000] <nessy>
and the spec is too long for its own good anyway - takes ages to load in any browser!

[07:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: Some aspects of XML 1.1 are undead, though

[07:10:00.0000] <nessy>
btw: does anyone know why the links in the ToC at http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html don't work?

[07:10:01.0000] <nessy>
I guess it's just the #websrt one that doesn't ...

[07:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
nessy: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/video.html#websrt loads faster

[07:12:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah, I know, but I wanted to check what's in the w3c's spec

[07:12:01.0000] <nessy>
I always use the whatwg link :)

[07:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oops, I got confused and forgot it was still in the HTML5 documents too

[07:12:03.0000] <nessy>
hmm… it seems it had to do with the page not being properly loaded by my browser - forget it :)

[07:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: that link probably doesn't work because that section is recently added and so the splitter has generated a new output file for it, and I've not yet committed that to cvs

[07:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll take a look noew

[07:21:02.0000] <nessy>
it worked after a reaload actually

[07:21:03.0000] <nessy>
nothing to worry about

[07:59:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, fwiw, treating CR as TAB without tab stops is not something I really understand

[08:27:00.0000] <webr3>
re spaces; here's a list of all the one I know:

[08:27:01.0000] <webr3>
\u0020 //SPACE | \u00A0 //NO-BREAK SPACE | \u1361 //ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE | \u1680 //OGHAM SPACE MARK | \u2002 //EN SPACE | \u2003 //EM SPACE | \u2004 //THREE-PER-EM SPACE | \u2005 //FOUR-PER-EM SPACE | \u2006 //SIX-PER-EM SPACE | \u2007 //FIGURE SPACE | \u2008 //PUNCTUATION SPACE | \u2009 //THIN SPACE | \u200A //HAIR SPACE | \u200B //ZERO WIDTH SPACE | \u202F //NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE | \u205F //MEDIUM MATHEMATICAL SPACE | \u2408 

[08:28:00.0000] <annevk>
oh hey webr3, didn't know you were on IRC

[08:28:01.0000] <webr3>
yeah i am

[08:29:00.0000] <webr3>
almost feel like saying sorry about the noise; but at the same time i see it as an issue, that probably can't be addressed! web's safe so it's cool

[08:29:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://simon.html5.org/dump/ecmascript-whitespace.txt

[08:29:02.0000] <webr3>
zcorpan_: cheers

[08:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the "opera" column is out of date

[08:30:01.0000] <annevk>
webr3, discussion is good

[08:30:02.0000] <webr3>
zcorpan_ maybe check for \u303F - is missing off that page

[08:30:03.0000] <webr3>
annevk: agreed

[08:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
webr3: i checked for all of BMP

[08:31:01.0000] <webr3>
:)

[08:31:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
in o10.5x i get:

[08:31:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
9 10 11 12 13 32 133 160 5760 6158 6159 8192 8193 8194 8195 8196 8197 8198 8199 8200 8201 8202 8203 8232 8233 8239 8287 12288 65279 65534

[08:31:04.0000] <webr3>
definitive list, I'll update my trim()'s!

[08:35:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
note that this is whitespace in ecmascript eval()

[08:36:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
whitespace in ecmascript source is hopefully the same

[08:36:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
but whitespace in other places is different

[08:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
"other places"?

[08:36:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
i mean like in html and css

[08:36:04.0000] <jgraham>
Ah

[08:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well yes, ECMAScript says "all other characters in unicode class Zs" or something

[08:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
HTML has a shor fixed list

[08:37:02.0000] <jgraham>
*short

[08:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
(ECMAScript also has a short list or doesn't-matter-what-unicode-says characters)

[08:38:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
the ecmascript definition is annoying because it doesn't say which version of unicode, just requires unicode 2.0 or later (or something)

[08:38:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
and it changes over time

[08:38:03.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed

[08:39:00.0000] <annevk>
pretty great that we are now at the point where we can argue over whitespace definitions rather than all the shit we had to emulate from IE6 :p

[08:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
Unicode 3.0

[08:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
(it says "must... Unicode 3.0 ... may ... later versions")

[08:40:01.0000] <annevk>
(of course, it's not quite like that, but it certainly has improved)

[08:40:02.0000] <jgraham>
(so even if characters are moved out of Zs in later versions, tehy still have to be recognised as whitespace)

[08:40:03.0000] <jgraham>
(which has happened a couple of times iirc)

[08:41:00.0000] <annevk>
wait what?

[08:41:01.0000] <annevk>
oh god

[08:42:00.0000] <annevk>
TC39...

[08:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: ?

[08:47:01.0000] <annevk>
you pointing out it's as inconsistent as hell

[08:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well not really

[08:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
It's slightly more consistent than just saying "whatever versuion of unicode you like"

[08:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
slightly less consistent than saying "just this set of characters"

[08:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Unicode versions are a pain no matter how you handle them...

[09:02:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, latest version would have been more consistent

[09:04:00.0000] <annevk>
relying on specifications not evolving is silly and codifying it is worse

[09:07:00.0000] <boblet>
dear cabal, I published some stuff on ruby

[09:07:01.0000] <boblet>
http://html5doctor.com/ruby-rt-rp-element/

[09:07:02.0000] <boblet>
and some supporting code snippets and notes here: http://oli.jp/example/ruby/

[09:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I like the Chinese examples

[09:11:01.0000] <boblet>
hehehe

[09:11:02.0000] <boblet>
naughty me

[09:12:00.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: do you understand Chinese, or are you just exceptionally clued on about Chinese internet memes?

[09:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: nice work

[09:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The latter

[09:13:01.0000] <boblet>
hey Mike! thanks man

[09:13:02.0000] <Dashiva>
By the way, ruby is used very creatively in Japanese

[09:13:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Translations, clarificatioins, all kinds of weird stuff

[09:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://dashiva.net/misc/baldr03.jpg

[09:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The ruby is ... Japanese transliterations of the English words for the translated Japanese

[09:16:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: you gonna be around next Tue-Thur? I’ll be in town. would be nice to catch up — maybe the W3 mixed rotenburo trip Naoko was talking about?

[09:16:02.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: it’s mainly just furigana and romaji for kanji pronunciation

[09:16:03.0000] <Dashiva>
http://dashiva.net/misc/baldr08.jpg

[09:16:04.0000] <Dashiva>
This one made me smile

[09:17:00.0000] <boblet>
hehe

[09:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: will be at home, yeah

[09:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me heads away for a bit

[11:31:00.0000] <shepazutoo>
hsivonen: I think there's a typo in your moz post "the more maintainable code base of the HTML5 compared to Gecko’s old HTML parser." -> "the more maintainable code base of the HTML5 parser compared to Gecko’s old HTML parser."

[11:33:00.0000] <shepazutoo>
hsivonen: also, "<DOCTYPE !html>" -> "<!DOCTYPE html>"

[11:34:00.0000] <annevk>
/me was just about to point that out :)

[11:36:00.0000] <shepazutoo>
but overall, a nice summary, thanks, hsivonen 

[11:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
shepazutoo: thanks. forwarded to blizzard

[11:51:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Ahoy!

[12:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
shepazutoo: fixed. thanks

[12:03:00.0000] <annevk>
http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/giving-voice-to-more-languages-on.html -- hmm eSpeak is GPL; I wonder what loophole is being used here

[12:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: They're not distributing compiled code that contains eSpeak, so the GPL obligations on releasing source code don't apply

[12:05:00.0000] <annevk>
Aah, so GPL can be "abused" by server applications?

[12:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[12:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
(if you consider it abuse)

[12:05:03.0000] <annevk>
The people who drafted it probably do

[12:05:04.0000] <Philip`>
The Affero GPL is designed to prevent that situation

[12:07:00.0000] <annevk>
Seems like quite the loophole given all the "cloud" thingies going on

[12:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder if you could sell something and include "You must forfeit your GPL-granted rights for this product" in the contract terms

[12:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can include anything you want in the contract terms

[12:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
People will probably happily agree to it too

[12:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But would it be legally solid?

[12:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
The GPL says "You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License." which sounds like you could argue it covers that situation

[12:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Sounds like it, yeah

[12:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange"

[12:18:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Like floppies!

[14:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is there any way to blur out an image from JavaScript?  Like you have some image at a URL, and you want to include that image, but blurred.  Is this something canvas can do somehow?

[14:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me knows nothing about image stuff

[14:45:00.0000] <miketaylr>
i've seen a js lib that does that i think

[14:45:01.0000] <miketaylr>
/me looks

[14:46:00.0000] <miketaylr>
aha. AryehGregor: http://www.pixastic.com/lib/docs/actions/blur/

[14:46:01.0000] <miketaylr>
http://www.pixastic.com/lib/docs/actions/blurfast/ is way more intense

[14:46:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah.

[14:46:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's what I'm looking for.

[14:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, MPL 1.1.

[14:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's not GPL-compatible, is it?

[14:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, probably no one's looking too hard.

[14:48:02.0000] <miketaylr>
/me has no idea

[14:48:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's probably fine if I keep it served in totally separate files, I guess.

[15:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
AryehGregor: you could use an svg filter

[15:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Seems like there's a library to do it, which already uses canvas+IE filters for IE.

[15:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Good enough for me.

[15:35:00.0000] <roc>
canvas???

[15:35:01.0000] <roc>
SVG filters would perform a lot better

[15:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
SVG isn't a cool new toy, though

[15:36:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
svg filters in text/html is a cool new toy

[15:37:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it doesn't even work in any shipping browser

[15:57:00.0000] <roc>
zcorpan_: svg filters in text/html works in Firefox 3.5 and later

[15:57:01.0000] <roc>
you just put the filter in an external SVG file

[17:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey, it's boaz

[17:16:00.0000] <boaz>
MikeSmith!

[17:16:01.0000] <boaz>
yo, I've been idling in here for a few weeks

[17:16:02.0000] <boaz>
:D

[17:18:00.0000] <boaz>
MikeSmith: how's tokyo?

[17:19:00.0000] <boaz>
hey, by the way: http://code.bocoup.com/audio-data-api/examples/ambient-extraction-mixer/

[17:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boaz: tokyo is feeling impoverished by the lack of annevk

[17:22:00.0000] <boaz>
bummer

[17:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk was visiting for a while but ended his visit a few days back

[17:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Ambient Audio Extraction looks relevant to some recent discussion about starting a W3C incubator group for audio-related API work

[17:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/2010/04/audio/audio-incubator-charter.html

[17:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boaz: oh, I see that page is actually one that Al MacDonald made

[17:26:01.0000] <boaz>
yah

[17:27:00.0000] <boaz>
it's his, I'm sitting right next to him

[17:28:00.0000] <llrcombs>
hey

[17:28:01.0000] <llrcombs>
I'm getting an SQL error when I try to INSERT

[17:28:02.0000] <llrcombs>
transaction.executeSql("INSERT INTO quotes (id, quote, name, life, response) VALUES (?,?,?,?,\"Type here to respond!\")",

[17:28:03.0000] <llrcombs>
SQL Error.  Error was "constraint failed" (Code 1)

[17:28:04.0000] <boaz>
mikesmith: we work together at bocoup, and we're all pretty pumped about the audio incubator!

[17:28:05.0000] <llrcombs>
(after the , comes the other arguments, i.e. the ? values)

[17:29:00.0000] <boaz>
mikesmith: Al just finished, so I thought I'd share.

[17:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boaz: cool, thanks.. and tell Al thanks too

[17:31:01.0000] <boaz>
yeah! definitely!

[17:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
boaz: I've not been following the audio XG plans so closely.. Doug Schepers is driving it

[17:32:00.0000] <llrcombs>
is it possible to get the text SQL query from a transaction after an executeSQL call?

[17:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I'm catching up on it now

[17:32:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
boaz: I was kind of away for a bit last month

[17:32:03.0000] <boaz>
right on, nice, yeah, doug is the man!

[17:32:04.0000] <boaz>
he was up here for the mozilla hack weekend a few weeks ago

[17:33:00.0000] <boaz>
also, welcome back!

[17:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
llrcombs: sounds like q sqllite error maybe? so checking the sqllite docs might be good, dunno

[17:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
boaz: yeah, Doug is a whirlwind of activity

[17:33:03.0000] <llrcombs>
it seems that HTML5 provides its own SQLite dialect

[17:34:00.0000] <llrcombs>
which is... pretty much 100% undocumented

[17:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
llrcombs: at this point it's not likely to ever get documented, because it's not actually in HTML5 any more

[17:35:01.0000] <llrcombs>
why not?

[17:35:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
client-side SQL DB is not going to be part of the Web platform cross-browser

[17:36:00.0000] <llrcombs>
Safari 4 implemented it...

[17:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, Opera has too, I think

[17:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but Mozilla and Microsoft IE have no plans to implement it

[17:42:00.0000] <llrcombs>
the localStorage API

[17:43:00.0000] <llrcombs>
does it support a table-ish method of doing this?

[17:46:00.0000] <karlcow>
http://john.jubjubs.net/2010/05/11/whats-next-for-me-but-not-yet/

[17:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
llrcombs: no, the localstorage api does not have an built-in support like that

[17:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
you can layer something on top of it in your code, though

[17:51:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
or there may already be some support for that in whatever JS libraries

[17:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
llrcombs: there is also active work going on around a different, non-SQL client-side DB mechanism

[17:53:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is there a document that helps developers decide which storage mechanism is the right one for them?

[18:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's no way to say something like "fire a script every time any <img> loads", is there?  Other than by actually adding an onload handler to every <img> in the HTML source?

[18:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or by putting a <script> right after every <img>, or whatever?

[18:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, so I don't have to alter the HTML markup.

[18:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Add a capturing event listener on the body

[18:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, cool.  Is that interoperably supported?

[18:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't see why it wouldn't be

[18:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
(ignoring IE)

[18:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
and at least it works in Opera

[18:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Too bad I have to deal with IE.  :)

[18:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
It should work in IE9 :-)

[18:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, I'll make a note on my calendar to start using it in 2020.

[18:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Maybe IE's event functions have similar features, but I have no idea about that)

[18:44:00.0000] <boblet>
morning all. anyone ever marked up musical scores?

[18:52:00.0000] <boblet>
hrm. I’ll check the logs in case anyone has the answer 

[18:52:01.0000] <boblet>
bbl

[20:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
this is super sexy: http://0xfe.blogspot.com/2010/05/music-notation-with-html5-canvas.html

[20:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
now I want to see the interactive version that lets you edit a score live

[20:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not a music expert, but the demo seems incorrect.  Aren't the little musical symbols supposed to mostly be on the lines, not scattered in random places overlapping each other?

[20:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
looks right to me

[20:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
By the way, for those who remember my doctype woes: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/66254

[20:08:02.0000] <doublec>
looks right to me too

[20:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
What browsers?  I'm on Chrome dev channel.

[20:08:04.0000] <roc>
I don't know it's right, but it looks cool

[20:08:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Safari 4.0.5 and WebKit trunk

[20:08:06.0000] <roc>
Firefox trunk

[20:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's definitely correct

[20:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I can read music

[20:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe they are supposed to be randomly floating around like that, then.

[20:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can't.  :)

[20:09:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I mean, correct is relative

[20:09:05.0000] <othermaciej>
some of the notes are supposed to be above or below the staff

[20:10:00.0000] <doublec>
I look forward to a tool like 'guitar pro' being available as a web app

[20:10:01.0000] <roc>
it would be slightly nicer if it output SVG, but whatever

[20:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so you could scale your score?

[20:11:01.0000] <roc>
yeah, and for printing

[20:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
some of the guitar tablature doesn't match the notes

[20:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
that is indeed correctly written music

[20:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
syntactically correct, that is

[20:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, almost

[20:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
would the TAB not matching the score count as a syntax error or a semantic error?

[20:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
the last measure of the first line is short and missing an end marker

[20:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
some of it does match, so I don't think the mismatch is deliberate

[20:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, it's just line wrapped half-way through a bar

[20:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
still, not at all bad for a demo

[20:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, it's quite nice

[20:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the note shapes look good

[22:10:00.0000] <boblet>
well that’s inconvenient. logs are down so if anyone gave me info about marking up musical scores I’d appreciate a repeat

[22:21:00.0000] <erlehmann>
boblet, lilypond ?

[22:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me ponders how to make timed tracks load

[22:24:00.0000] <boblet>
erlehmann: hmm, thanks. so this is a custom notation for use by Lilypond software, rather than a way to display music scores on web pages right? (if you know)

[22:25:00.0000] <erlehmann>
boblet, the lilypond authors have written a paper about musical notation. i recommend you read it, it explains why e.g. XML is unsuited for that purpose.

[22:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
the lilypond guys are basically the world leaders in music typography as far as i can tell

[22:29:01.0000] <boblet>
erlehmann: do you have a link? I see it can output SVG though, that’s good

[22:31:00.0000] <erlehmann>
boblet, http://lilypond.org/about/automated-engraving/

[22:32:00.0000] <erlehmann>
read everything, be enlightened

[22:32:01.0000] <erlehmann>
or, wait. start here: http://lilypond.org/about/automated-engraving/problem-statement

[22:32:02.0000] <boblet>
hehe, read about/intro, was reading about/faq…

[22:33:00.0000] <boblet>
thanks

[22:49:00.0000] <dannytran>
hi everyone ... question ... i'm writing a web socket server ... and for some reason google chrome's WebSocket connection is not sending 8 random bytes

[22:49:01.0000] <dannytran>
what am I doing wrong?

[22:49:02.0000] <dannytran>
it's not sending Sec-WebSocket-Key1 or Sec-WebSocket-Key2 either

[22:51:00.0000] <erlehmann>
dannytran, i do not know about websocket. why is this random byte thingy needed ?

[22:51:01.0000] <dannytran>
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-76#page-32

[22:52:00.0000] <dannytran>
html5?

[22:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
dannytran: chrome doesn't yet implement the new handshake

[22:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
dannytran: tis still very early days for websocket

[22:53:02.0000] <dannytran>
ahh

[22:54:00.0000] <dannytran>
so where would i find documentation on how chrome does handle web sockets

[22:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i recommend waiting a few weeks until they update to the new handshake

[22:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
but for the server the old handshake is basically the same as the new one, just without the key part

[22:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
and you can ignore the client's handshake

[22:56:02.0000] <dannytran>
Hixie:  very cool ... thank you

[22:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
np

[22:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me is waiting for chrome to update too

[23:03:00.0000] <nog_lorp>
The major httpd vendors should work together to ban old browsers from the internet

[23:03:01.0000] <ment>
like lynx and stuff

[23:03:02.0000] <nog_lorp>
Serve anyone with a browser older than 5 years old a sorry error

[23:04:00.0000] <nog_lorp>
yeah, and tell them a UA they can spoof to get by

[23:04:01.0000] <nog_lorp>
if they really want it

[23:04:02.0000] <nog_lorp>
since that is the bottom line of detection

[23:04:03.0000] <nog_lorp>
the point is to oust the entreched IE4 population

[23:06:00.0000] <nog_lorp>
And there are modern builds of lynx I think

[23:06:01.0000] <nog_lorp>
last stale build was 10 months ago

[23:06:02.0000] <nog_lorp>
stable*

[23:12:00.0000] <dannytran>
Hixie:  sorry to bother you again ... but which version of  the protocol should i expect google chrome to be using? http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-75#page-25

[23:15:00.0000] <nog_lorp>
I say screw security and give javascript access to raw sockets

[23:16:00.0000] <nog_lorp>
ooh maybe that'll be doable threw the device tag?

[23:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.pcworld.com/article/196023/facebook_privacy.html

[23:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
dude has an inspiring bio

[23:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
search in that page for "Author Dan Tynan"

[23:22:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: you could use that bio yourself!

[23:32:00.0000] <wirepair>
MikeSmith nice article, i love the blue graphs ;>

[01:03:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, heh, you're too kind :)

[01:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: hopefully you can get back for another visit sooner rather than later

[01:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm trying http://code.bocoup.com/audio-data-api/examples/ambient-extraction-mixer/ in latest Minefield but I don't get any sound at all when I try it

[01:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders if boaz is still around

[01:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK, I see I need a special build

[01:58:00.0000] <annevk>
is the IE blog just trying very hard to sound silly with their "same markup"?

[02:04:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
annevk: I guess they're just trying to coin a term and see if others start to pick it up

[02:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
of course it's not an accurate term

[02:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is that their buzzword attempt to stamp out IE-specific code paths?

[02:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[02:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems so

[02:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
silly buzzword, good motive

[02:07:00.0000] <annevk>
at some point in blogging history we used to have debates on "tag" vs "element"

[02:07:01.0000] <annevk>
it seems everyone has moved on from that or otherwise there'd be huge outcry over "same markup"

[02:10:00.0000] <ment>
what does "same markup" mean?

[02:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
people are ok with using "HTML5" to refer to anything cool you can do on the Web without plugins

[02:12:00.0000] <karlcow>
HTML5 is the new black for now, and will become the new hell in a few years from now (cf XHTML). Marketing/Branding Cycles.

[02:12:01.0000] <annevk>
ment, ask Microsoft

[02:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I dunno - "Web 2.0" and "AJAX" both still get plenty of pla, and they are years out of date

[02:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ment: I think it's supposed to mean "you don't need an IE-specific code path any more cause IE supports standards and stuff"

[02:15:00.0000] <karlcow>
othermaciej: I start to see/hear "Web 2.0" as a forbidden term in commercial propositions for websites. Or maybe my own working environment distortion field

[02:16:00.0000] <karlcow>
http://www.google.com/trends?q=html5%2C+xhtml%2C+web+2.0

[02:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.google.com/trends?q=html5%2C+xhtml%2C+web+2.0%2C+ajax&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=0

[02:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think most of the ajax hits are non-web

[02:18:00.0000] <karlcow>
ajax: cleaning product, football team, greek mythology, etc

[02:18:01.0000] <mut>
whoop

[02:18:02.0000] <karlcow>
very common indeed http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax

[02:18:03.0000] <mut>
I actually finished this sodding website.

[02:18:04.0000] <ment>
othermaciej: i assume that means something different than "we support standards"

[02:19:00.0000] <ment>
also as i'm reading the ie blog, what does GPU-powered HTML5 mean, other than running h.264 decoder in hw?

[02:19:01.0000] <ment>
s/in hw/on gpu/

[02:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe they mean that their browser engine will do drawing using GPU-accelerated APIs

[02:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
though of course most drawing is not HTML per se

[02:28:00.0000] <ment>
hmm, for a moment i was excited about the idea of microsoft's parallelizing javascript compiler

[02:29:00.0000] <Peter`>
ment: what changed your mind?

[02:33:00.0000] <ment>
Peter`: video cards ten to crash often when running CUDA code and i don't really want my os to be taken down by some compiled js script

[02:34:00.0000] <Peter`>
From what I understand they parallize compiling (while running the interpreter) on multiple CPU cores, not using the GPU/CUDA

[02:37:00.0000] <ment>
Peter`: i think that's different kind of parallelization than i have in mind - they probably just run multiple javascript states on multiple cores, not one javascript state on multiple cores concurrently

[02:38:00.0000] <Peter`>
I understand, but where exactly does CUDA come around? Do they actually compile (bits) of JS code to CUDA?

[02:40:00.0000] <ment>
i've imagined that ie would compile js with parallelizing compiler into cuda code and run on GPU when i heard about "GPU-accelerated HTML5", but that's a silly idea

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It's really more like GPU-accelerated SVG and CSS painting

[02:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but HTML5 is cooler than SVG or CSS

[02:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
as a marketing buzzword that is

[02:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"First, SVG is part of the HTML 5 family of technologies." -- http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/10/svg-at-google-and-in-internet-explorer.html

[02:45:01.0000] <Peter`>
With various companies claiming "HTML5" and "CSS3" support combined with a really small percentage of people who actually understand it's fairly hard to stop that

[02:45:02.0000] <Peter`>
It does put more weight behind development of the more prominent features however, so I recon it brings good things as well

[02:46:00.0000] <annevk>
back then still with a space

[02:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
OTOH: https://twitter.com/bradneuberg/status/13161144493

[02:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
SVG is lacking a cool number like 3 or 5

[02:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It's well-known that 1.1 and 2 are not cool numbers :-)

[02:49:01.0000] <ment>
if any, it definitely has to be an odd number, preferably prime

[02:49:02.0000] <karlcow>
Peter`: first people will be happy. HTML5 wiiiiz effect, then they will realize there are many holes, interoperability issues creating arguments with their clients, etc. and because there is only one word even if it's about a specific part, they will start to hate it.

[02:51:00.0000] <Peter`>
karlcow: Quite likely indeed, in the end we might even end up with a "good browser" being defined as "the browser who most advertised their HTML5 compliance"

[02:51:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
what's happened to the logs lately?

[02:51:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
krijnh?

[02:53:00.0000] <ment>
btw does html5 specify where are line-breaks allowed when layouting/rendering? (for example, where are line breaks allowed in "some text<b>in bold</b>the end"?)

[02:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ment: that belongs in the CSS land

[02:53:02.0000] <annevk>
oh hey, <track> is no longer in the W3C copy, saves some editing work in html5-diff I guess...

[02:54:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i thought the chairs only wanted websrt removed

[02:54:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, according to krijn we're still being logged but the server changed IP and DNS was not updated or something

[02:54:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[02:55:00.0000] <ment>
hsivonen: css is not particulary verbose about line breaks either (Note. CSS 2.1 does not fully define where line breaking opportunities occur.)

[02:55:01.0000] <krijn>
Ah, my IP changed, grmbl

[02:55:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
ment: maybe you need to reverse engineer browsers and write a spec

[02:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ment: it belongs in CSS but CSS hasn't quite drank the "well-defined" kool aid to the fullest yet

[02:56:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, thought so too, but it seems Hixie just took the whole thing out

[02:56:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
ment: i think unicode has some rules about line breaking opportunities also

[02:56:03.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if a html5-diff based on the WHATWG spec would be more useful

[02:56:04.0000] <hsivonen>
/me mumbles about hyphenation and idolizing performance

[02:57:00.0000] <annevk>
ment, there's Unicode TR #14 iirc

[02:57:01.0000] <annevk>
my memory is pretty good: http://unicode.org/reports/tr14/

[02:58:00.0000] <annevk>
but then I believe it's not very good and most vendors deviate from it intentionally

[02:58:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
so we need Line Breaking 5

[02:59:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, so far consensus is that line breaking is something to compete on

[02:59:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me is fine with thtat

[02:59:02.0000] <ment>
ah this, i'm not interested in hyphenation/word-breaks but rather html/css rules regarding breaking of inline boxes with decoration and stuff like that

[02:59:03.0000] <krijn>
DNS is being changed, logs will be up in no time! o/

[03:00:00.0000] <annevk>
ment, that should be defined in CSS

[03:00:01.0000] <karlcow>
I do not 

[03:00:02.0000] <karlcow>
         understand the hate 

[03:00:03.0000] <karlcow>
                             about line breaks.

[03:01:00.0000] <annevk>
that is

[03:01:01.0000] <annevk>
because you

[03:01:02.0000] <annevk>
are French

[03:01:03.0000] <karlcow>
;)

[03:02:00.0000] <annevk>
ment, and afaik is

[03:03:00.0000] <ment>
maybe i should read more between the lines then

[03:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
I hate Hixie

[03:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: that's a bit strong. what did Hixie do now?

[03:04:02.0000] <jgraham>
I have just come across some of his old test cases

[03:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
main identifying feature: astrophy

[03:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
They are... not pretty

[03:05:02.0000] <jgraham>
:)

[03:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: at least Hixie usually keeps his old test cases around, which is much nicer than finding the whole host name gone

[03:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Well yes. Hopefully these ones we imported internally (even Hixie's server goes down sometimes)

[03:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I haven't read the whole timed text thread yet

[03:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
is Sean Hayes articulating an IE-oriented position or a Microsoft media framework-oriented position?

[03:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I think Sean is not part of the IE product-dev team

[03:14:01.0000] <annevk>
nobody really knows, but he doesn't work for the IE Team that's for sure

[03:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
Seems to be more of a person-heavily-involved-in-defining-TTML oriented position

[03:14:03.0000] <roc>
yeah

[03:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Frank Olivier is part of the IE team

[03:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
thanks

[03:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
he is listed as one of the authors of TTML and says he is the co-chair of the Timed Text WG

[03:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I think the an IE-oriented view is much more relevant than a person-heavily-involved-in-defining-TTML view

[03:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know to what extent he is representing that position and how much the IE position

[03:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/the//

[03:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
A person-heavily-involved-in-defining-TTML view seems useful if you want to know details about TTML or about its history and design decisions

[03:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
though probably not so much if you want objective comparisons with other formats

[03:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
It seems less useful if they often say things that are contradicted by the text of the spec

[03:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
his claims about the relation to CSS and XSL-FO in context seem like puffery

[03:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in the legal sense

[03:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"Puffery as a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_term refers to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising and claims that express http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity rather than http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(journalism) views, such that no reasonable person would take them literally."

[03:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
damn you Colloquy for expanding links! sometimes I just wanna paste plain text

[03:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
instead of tacit knowledge, perhaps W3C spec editors should get an actual memo warning them about depending on XML Schema or XSL-FO in Web specs

[03:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it would be useful to find out what subset of TTML is supported in Flash

[03:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or xml:id or XML Events or XML 1.1

[03:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: and what the actual layout model is there

[03:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, that too

[03:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc asked about both, iirc

[03:24:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and got only a response about TTML support in Silverlight

[03:24:04.0000] <roc>
that's fair, in a sense

[03:25:00.0000] <roc>
obviously Larry Masinter should be the one to tell us about TTML in Flash

[03:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, it'd be great to have a response from somebody in the group who had specific product knowledge about Flash support 

[03:25:02.0000] <roc>
where's he gone, anyway?

[03:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be more great to have test cases to verify their claims

[03:26:01.0000] <annevk>
anyone else thought of CSS XBL vs SVG XBL, XSL:FO vs CSS, Selectors vs XPath, during this WebSRT vs TTML chatter on the mailing list?

[03:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: yes

[03:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it would also be great to get a response to the point that roc made about the layout mechanism not being implementable in existing browser layout engines

[03:28:00.0000] <roc>
Philip`: wanna write some?

[03:28:01.0000] <roc>
I don't!

[03:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I kind of would like the HTML WG to be free of format wars to the degree possible :-/

[03:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but yes, this is reminiscent of many past ones

[03:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
one could also cite Microdata vs RDFa

[03:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: it seems to me we walk from one format war to another all the time

[03:30:01.0000] <annevk>
the problem is that there's no real other W3C group with the same amount of browser expertise apart from maybe the WebApps WG

[03:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: except MathML inclusion worked nicely

[03:30:03.0000] <othermaciej>
how about SVG inclusion?

[03:30:04.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Well I objected to MathML, but not strongly or anything :)

[03:30:05.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: what about CSS WG?

[03:30:06.0000] <annevk>
and walking away from things in the HTML WG doesn't usually lead to a conclusion elsewhere

[03:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: bygones, kumbaya

[03:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess SVG vs Canvas was a format war for a while, though that one is particularly crazy

[03:32:00.0000] <roc>
I think that's died down

[03:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, I think people have accepted that it doesn't need to be a versus situation

[03:32:02.0000] <roc>
yeah

[03:32:03.0000] <roc>
the CSS WG is not bad

[03:33:00.0000] <annevk>
it's not too bad, though the amount of times certain decisions are overturned...

[03:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would like to say that ECMA TC-39 has similar levels of browser expertise but I don't think it is up to the level of the three aforementioned W3C WGs

[03:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nor do any of the IETF WGs working on highly browser-relevant protocols

[03:34:01.0000] <annevk>
TC39 is not really addressing platform needs

[03:34:02.0000] <annevk>
I've been waiting for four years or so now for octet representation

[03:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
TC39 has too many of what my colleague Geoff terms "language goobers"

[03:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and not enough people tuned into non-JS-engine parts of the browser

[03:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
heck, barely enough people tuned into actual JS engine implementations

[03:35:02.0000] <jgraham>
The bytearray thing is really really urgent

[03:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
as opposed to language theory

[03:35:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I wish I either had time to work on it or order someone to do so

[03:35:05.0000] <jgraham>
The ECMA process is also totally broken

[03:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hmmm... maybe I can trick Oliver into it

[03:36:01.0000] <annevk>
best IETF group so far seems the cookie stuff

[03:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the ECMA process involves the spec going final before there are any implementations

[03:36:03.0000] <annevk>
mostly thanks to Adam Barth

[03:36:04.0000] <othermaciej>
which seems absurd by modern standards

[03:36:05.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm slightly unhappy that TC39 didn't spec the Web compat stuff that's chronicled on the WHATWG wiki

[03:36:06.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: bingo

[03:36:07.0000] <othermaciej>
I pointed this out and suggested we try to have something more like a "Candidate Rec" / "Draft Standard" stage

[03:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but no one really bought in

[03:37:01.0000] <annevk>
though even they turned away from addressing certain issues (e.g. publicsuffix)

[03:37:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: TC39 have an unshakable belief that old parts of the platform will die off and can be unspecced or even incorrectlyt specced (cough, octals, cough)

[03:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I think degree of belief in this varies

[03:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe none of the Apple people who participate (mainly olliej and me) are particularly convinced

[03:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Brendan is half-convinced

[03:38:02.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: It seems to be held by a significant number of major stakeholders, at least

[03:38:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the secure subset / object capability people are quite convinced

[03:38:04.0000] <jgraham>
Brendan seems pretty convinced

[03:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
on some issues he takes that tack, on others not so much

[05:04:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, it matters somewhat when including WebSRT in the media stream

[05:11:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders why Julian didn't reply to his reply

[05:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders how much the Archos thingies with Opera on them cost

[05:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. almost 400 euros

[05:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it seems rather weak to argue for XSL by referring to W3C spec maturity levels

[05:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or to argue for anything at all by referring to the W3C spec maturity levels

[05:24:00.0000] <annevk>
catching up with email?

[05:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed. W3C spec maturity levels are a red herring

[05:24:02.0000] <annevk>
that thread is funny

[05:24:03.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: yeah, I still have a lot unread list email

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I might take the maturity levels more seriously if all WGs required two interoperable implementations *in browsers* and were serious about test suites

[05:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
which thread?

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: timed text

[05:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I'm about to land validator support for HTML5+ARIA+SVG+MathML as the default. are you OK with it becoming the default in the W3C instance of V.nu, too?

[05:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yep

[05:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[05:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think in general the W3C instance should remain in sync with v.nu upstream

[06:12:00.0000] <zcorpan_>

"Warning: this may kill your browser, as it's quite an unoptimised script."

[06:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
Seems like an unfair comparison

[06:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
(although it would be surprising if SVG filters, implemented in C++ and potentially GPU accelerated weren't faster than javascript manipulating pixels on a canvas)

[06:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
That canvas demo looks like it'll fail if getImageData doesn't return 1 pixel per CSS pixel

[06:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, it even loops over x/y in the wrong order

[06:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Wrong in terms of performance)

[06:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
argh. SVN keeps rejecting my login

[06:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I reset my password. twice. still rejecting the new password

[06:23:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
SVN is having a break eating ice cream

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
works on Mac from within Eclipse

[06:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hmm. MikeSmith left :-(

[06:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
IIRC, Mike had experienced trouble with debian svn

[06:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe the Ubuntu package inherits brokenness from Debian

[06:26:01.0000] <annevk>
it's 9:30PM in Tokyo

[06:26:02.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith is barely awake then

[06:26:03.0000] <annevk>
guess he might be online later due to weird telcon hours

[06:26:04.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, he's awake surprisingly often

[06:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me finds http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20090603#l-626

[06:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
command-line svn on Mac worked, too

[06:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
though I got a post-commit hook error from the server

[06:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. I guess this was a server-side problem

[06:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
not I managed to commit from Ubuntu

[06:40:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and I got the same post-commit hook error

[06:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: No, I meant has barely woken up yet :)

[06:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
He seems to be a night owl

[06:46:00.0000] <annevk>
fyi, I was in Tokyo the last three weeks staying at his place

[06:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
there's something scary and frustrating about being locked out of version control

[06:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: I know

[06:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
validator.nu went down for a libc update

[06:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
up again

[06:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
time zones are a huge FAIL

[06:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's ridiculous how often the tzdata package gets updated

[06:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
OK. validator.nu and html5.validator.nu now support HTML5+ARIA+SVG+MathML

[06:59:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
yay

[06:59:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fhsivonen.iki.fi%2Ftest%2Fmoz%2Fhtml5-hacks-demo.html&showsource=yes

[06:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I landed HTML5+ARIA+SVG+MathML

[07:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: cool

[07:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: you planning to blog about it?

[07:00:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: selecting the preset selects the xml parser

[07:00:03.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yes

[07:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: doh. I forgot to update the .js file

[07:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: thanks

[07:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: Fixed the preset.

[07:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: everything checked in?

[07:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: everything except script.js

[07:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, I'll wait for that before syncing up the validator.w3.org instances

[07:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: committed

[07:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

http://html5readiness.com/

[08:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
I have never understood the colour sceheme on that site

[08:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
Firefox should be orange OPera red (it is, good), Chrome and IE should fight over blue and Safari should be grey

[08:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
paul_irish: how about adding HTML5 parsing?

[08:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
Also including Opera 10.10 but IE 9 seems odd

[08:13:02.0000] <paul_irish>
:) to html5 readiness?

[08:13:03.0000] <hsivonen>
paul_irish: right

[08:14:00.0000] <paul_irish>
that's a good call.

[08:15:00.0000] <tabatkins>
That site yours, paul_irish?

[08:15:01.0000] <paul_irish>
yup

[08:15:02.0000] <jgraham>
(actually IE shoud clearly be blue. Dunno what to do with Chrome)

[08:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if people with synesthesia get this feeling of colours being wrong all the time

[08:17:00.0000] <tabatkins>
IE can take dark blue, we'll take pastel.

[08:17:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Safari should be green, obviously :P

[08:17:02.0000] <paul_irish>
its primary intent is to show developers that html5/css3 is ready based on features, not specs. to try and defeat the "i'll wait till it's done" mentality

[08:18:00.0000] <tabatkins>
I really love the immediate visual impact of clicking between the years.

[08:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, awesome. The new equality minister in Britain has voted against almost all bills for equality with homosexuals in the past decade…

[08:18:02.0000] <tabatkins>
Perhaps he wants homosexuals to be better than heteros, and equality would be holding them back?

[08:19:00.0000] <tabatkins>
Hmm.  Chrome is insufficiently fast in running these transitions.

[08:19:01.0000] <Dashiva>
He doesn't want them to suffer the horror that is married life

[08:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
Oh. I take it he's a Tory then

[08:19:03.0000] <Dashiva>
It's an act of mercy

[08:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Indeed.

[08:20:01.0000] <karlcow>
jgraham: plus it's confusing because the position makes it harder to read, you are tempted to believe that a circle is one browser until you realize not

[08:20:02.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe the Lib Dems can beat some sense into them

[08:21:00.0000] <tabatkins>
karlcow: That just implicitly gives Chrome an edge, so it's okay.  ^_^

[08:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hopes it doesn't go the way of the Labour/LibDem coalition in Scotland from 1997–2005

[08:21:02.0000] <gsnedders>
*2007

[08:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is amazed that there is a coalition between Tory/LibDem, but that's another matter

[08:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And a referendum on electral reform? Wow.

[08:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I didn't expect that from the Tories

[08:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, it was either that or minority government

[08:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
Neither did I

[08:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
But who knows, maybe it will work

[08:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is also of the understanding that the Lib Dems could not enter a coalition officially until after a poll of all members

[08:24:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(like, the parlimentary party had to approve it, then the entire party…)

[08:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
I mean I expect to hate all the Tory policies, but I hope to like many of the Lib Dem ones

[08:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Trident may be replaced. Yay.

[08:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(</sarcasm>)

[08:26:00.0000] <tabatkins>
Aw, gsnedders, you got me all excited about MS doing something crazy.

[08:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Heh.

[08:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Why do I fail to be surprised under the coalition that the Scottish Secretary (which is now mostly a title and little more) is held by the smaller party?

[08:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me looks up what the Tories are. Finds...

[08:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
"The term was thus originally a term of abuse, "an Irish rebel", before being adopted as a political label in the same way as Whig." -- wikipedia

[08:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
... then looks up Whig.

[08:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
What is it with you british giving your political parties such weird names?

[08:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
People here 350 years ago spoke funny

[08:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or, depending on your point of view, people today do

[08:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's hard to verify, unless you can find a 350 year old person to ask

[08:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they would recognise our modern language as a clear improvement over theirs

[08:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://intertwingly.net/slides/2010/ws-rest/theses-4

[08:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if rubys said something about point #4 that isn't obvious from the slides

[08:35:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I think some british people speak funny. Particularly the Welsh and Scottish.

[08:36:00.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: not possible british would think that american is an improvement :p

[08:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Ah dinnae ken if ya cannae oonderstoond

[08:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I can usually understand spoken scottish. But it gets a little harder to figure out what "[I] dinnae ken [if you cannot understand]" translates to

[08:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
don't care

[08:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
wtf? Why would you put an 'n' sound in to "care"?

[08:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Because it's not trying to pronounce the word care.

[08:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, then what word were you trying to pronounce?

[08:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ken.

[08:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
in english?

[08:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
There is no English word.

[08:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ken#English

[08:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
From the Old English cennan

[08:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It's not really care, though

[08:44:03.0000] <gsnedders>
But the actual usage of it is somewhat confusing

[08:47:00.0000] <tabatkins>
Anyone know linear programming?

[08:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
Ah, I thought it meant "know"

[08:47:02.0000] <jgraham>
Seems I wasn't entirely wrong

[08:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
tabatkins: No, but it looks interesting :)

[08:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
tabatkins: I prefer my programming to be planar

[08:51:00.0000] <tabatkins>
I'm checking in with the people at work.  I'll bet there's a way to one-step the computation of flex units while satisfying min/max constraints, but all I know how to do right now is iterate and solve constraints as they are violated.

[08:52:00.0000] <tabatkins>
Anyway, off to grab breakfast and then go to class all day.  I'll check back tomorrow.

[08:53:00.0000] <annevk>
what kind of class are you taking?

[09:03:00.0000] <boaz>
hey all, if you're in boston: http://bocoup.eventwax.com/the-future-of-web-audio

[09:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm, randomly closing websockets when resource limits are reached seems bad

[09:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hey, it's perfectly conforming!

[09:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Especially if it would allow a single page to take down all connections made by other pages

[09:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/page.browsing context/ if you prefer

[09:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not sure what a good solution would be. You could throw an error but people likwly don't check for that

[09:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or enqueue the connection and hope the application provides UI telling the user about the problem

[09:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
Which has the slight advantage that pages may start to work "by magic" by closing other pages

[09:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Are there any stats on how many users never have more than one page open at a time?

[09:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Mozilla did some "number of tab" studies

[09:57:02.0000] <jgraham>
I think the distribution was bimodal at like 3 and 14

[09:57:03.0000] <webr3>
can't think of anywhere better to ask, so is anybody aware of browser utils available to JS for crypto functions (for instance sign, seal/encrypt, open/decrypt using client certificates installed in the browser) similar to mozilla/gecko window.crypto ?

[09:57:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if normal people have a hundred background tabs open and are likely to suffer problems when some unidentified tab blocks the one they're trying to use

[09:57:05.0000] <jgraham>
but I could be wrong

[09:58:00.0000] <webr3>
other way around; is there any whatwg work done, mentioned / planned making a spec for js crypto functions?

[10:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://dubroy.com/blog/how-many-tabs-do-people-use-now-with-real-data/ ?

[10:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like it asked for participants who "often use multiple tabs or windows" which would bias the results away from 1

[10:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: IIRC, I promised to ping you when v.nu supports MathML in text/html. that would be now

[11:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: yeah if you're dealing with the tests/evil/mixed test cases i apologise :-)

[11:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
those are ooold

[11:29:00.0000] <webr3>
widgets run in the browser yes?

[11:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: It wasn't, it was adhoc, I think

[11:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: oh dear

[11:29:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: He's also not at a computer now :P

[11:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/481 says in IE9

[11:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
isn't pretty much everything from the last few years under adhoc?

[11:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
not everything

[11:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
i put things that are more complicated or harder to justify under evil/

[11:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Like acid3? :)

[11:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me gestures in the general direction of http://hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/level0/write/005.html

[11:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
pah, that's simple

[11:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me runs away

[11:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I suspect the test case is bogus

[11:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
quite possible

[11:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have been quite lax in my maintenance of test cases

[11:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: specifically, the class attribute present stuff in 005a.js has a negation in script

[11:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so the test claim that a class attibute is present when it is absent

[11:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you e-mail me i'll add it to my large pile of things to fix in test suites

[11:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Can we send patches too and get it fixed more quickly?

[11:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it should be already be in your queue

[11:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
but the odds of me getting to it this decade are near 0

[11:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
k

[11:46:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Where is the class attribute supposed to come from? 

[11:46:06.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: no, the time-consuming part is the review

[11:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I guess I should arrange things so that my quarterly goals don't depend on that test then...

[11:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I can't find anything defining or setting @class in the main page, 005a, or 005b

[11:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses he should go home soon

[11:47:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is 2010 the first or last year of this decade for you?

[11:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
first

[11:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
wrong answer, kthxbai.

[11:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
:-)

[11:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: it wouldn't make sense for the decade known as "the 90s" to not span 1990-1999

[11:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: indeed!

[11:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And this decade is "the 10s"?

[11:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or is this decade the 201st decade of the calendar?

[11:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
This is the last year of the 201st decade

[11:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is the main point of the test that dynamically added scripts should run after load => blow away the document?

[11:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
but the first year of the 10s decade

[11:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just like 2000 was the last year of the second millennium, but the first year of the 2000s.

[11:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So it's perfectly fair to celebrate the new millennium in both 2000 and 2001.

[11:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
Indeed

[11:52:03.0000] <Dashiva>
But why bother when you can celebrate the _current_ millennium any time you want?

[11:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
though it's wrong to claim that the millennium you're celebrating in 2000 is the start of the 3rd millennium

[11:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, why celebrate anniversaries of anything at all?

[11:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Because it's an excuse to party?

[11:53:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Because sheeple need excuses

[12:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why does <b> say authors "should" use better elements where appropriate, but <i> says authors "are encouraged to consider" using other elements where appropriate?

[13:50:00.0000] <svl>
hmm. rel="extension" - http://mozillalabs.com/jetpack/2010/05/12/indexing-and-auto-detecting-browser-extensions-on-the-web/

[14:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
tabatkins, if you aren't familiar with how TeX glue works, I'd highly recommend reading chapter 12 of The TeXbook.  It's like flexboxes, but very elegant and powerful, and a core part of how TeX works.  For instance, left/right/center alignment is obtained by just putting horizontal glue on one or both sides of the line.  There are probably some good ideas there.

[14:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Not to say that flexboxes aren't "very elegant and powerful", of course.  :P)

[14:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TeX is very cool.

[14:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not practical for variable-size everything like we have on the web, sadly.

[14:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
AryehGregor: Is the TeXbook available online for free?

[14:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins_, it seems like the TeX source code is available.

[14:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Not really interested in reading Knuth's programming.  ^_^

[14:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Google refuses to accept that "texbook" isn't a typo for "textbook".

[14:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So that's unhelpful.

[14:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikipedia search isn't as smart, so it just gives me a giant list of typos if I search Wikipedia for "texbook".

[14:54:00.0000] <pesla>
Anyone here on Colloquy? :)

[14:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me points pesla to othermaciej 

[15:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wait, what?

[15:43:00.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej: how does safari's implementation of WebSQLDB deal with never-ending transactions?

[15:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sicking: what do you mean by never-ending?

[15:43:02.0000] <sicking>
othermaciej: i.e. if you just nest executeSql calls in a never-ending fashion?

[15:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you could chain the callbacks forever, yes

[15:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
we don't do anything to prevent that

[15:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
because the model is asynchronous, it doesn't block the UI or anything

[15:44:03.0000] <sicking>
right, it just prevents anyone else from getting access to the database

[15:44:04.0000] <othermaciej>
also it's hard to do accidentally without causing your transaction to error out

[15:44:05.0000] <sicking>
and presumably uses a whole lot of CPU :)

[15:44:06.0000] <othermaciej>
anyone using that database on that domain, yes

[15:45:00.0000] <sicking>
when/how does a transaction error out?

[15:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if you execute a sql statement that would produce an error

[15:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if you exceed the capacity of the database

[15:45:03.0000] <othermaciej>
you could chain adding and then removing the same item within a transaction

[15:45:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but you'd really have to go out of your way

[15:45:05.0000] <sicking>
or just chain "select * from foo", right?

[15:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think I have ever actually seen an infinite transaction

[15:46:01.0000] <sicking>
yes, i agree it's hard to do this by accident

[15:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
well, chaining a read-only transaction is possible but a bit less disruptive since it doesn't block other readers

[15:46:03.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway - I don't think we have ever seen anyone actually run into a never-ending transaction

[15:46:04.0000] <othermaciej>
and a web app that does so would only be screwing itself

[15:47:00.0000] <sicking>
I agree, this isn't a big problem at all

[15:47:01.0000] <sicking>
imho it's ok as long as it's not easy to do by accident

[15:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so short version, we don't try to do anything specific to address this and it hasn't been a problem

[15:49:00.0000] <sicking>
great

[16:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh man another CORS flamewar?

[16:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Just the same one, I think

[16:54:00.0000] <webr3>
yeah but those headers in CORS need changed to the UMP ones | other than that I'm keeping my mouth shut


2010-05-13
[17:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Any of the html5lib guys awake at the moment?

[17:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Depends on who is sufficiently an html5lib guy for your requirements

[18:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Anyone responsible for the development of it.

[18:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
I have commit access and wrote some bits of its code

[18:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
though I'm largely irresponsible

[18:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Good enough.  You have any clue if you guys are going to try and get it pushed into the standard modules?

[18:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't believe I've heard anybody intending to try that any time soon

[18:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins_>
Kk.

[18:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
It ought to be made fast (i.e. written in C) before attempting to make it standard

[18:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
The teacher in this Python class I'm taking was just wondering.

[18:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins_>
As he had it listed as a standard external module.

[19:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: A Python class.

[21:47:00.0000] <paul_irish>
boblet: i'm working on your feature request. :)

[21:47:01.0000] <boblet>
paul_irish: lol

[21:47:02.0000] <boblet>
sorry to forget the @ in the original

[21:48:00.0000] <boblet>
I was pretty shocked how much things have changed in the last two years

[21:48:01.0000] <boblet>
really didn’t realise the rate of progress

[21:48:02.0000] <boblet>
yay browser makers!

[21:50:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Oh very colol indeed.

[21:50:01.0000] <asmodai>
cool

[21:50:02.0000] <paul_irish>
totally. :)  now, would you expect ie7 to remain in the same position as you change years?

[21:50:03.0000] <asmodai>
http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.in-nomine.org%2F~asmodai%2F3d.html passes as expected

[21:50:04.0000] <asmodai>
\o/

[21:51:00.0000] <asmodai>
Now to go back to being drained of my bodily moisture in this Thai heatwave

[21:52:00.0000] <boblet>
paul_irish: yeah — each browser is in the same arc, so flipping between 2008, 2009 and 2010 shows each arc filling out (well, depending on browser)

[21:52:01.0000] <divya>
boblet: some browsers disappear in later years

[21:53:00.0000] <paul_irish>
yah only from 2008, only ie7 survives until the 2010 view. :/

[21:53:01.0000] <boblet>
that makes things a little tricky

[21:53:02.0000] <divya>
Firefox 2 survives 08/09

[21:55:00.0000] <divya>
we could probably assign a position for each browser (irrespective of version)

[21:55:01.0000] <boblet>
hrm, you could have arcs for every browser in all views, and have them blank when that browser isn’t represented

[21:55:02.0000] <boblet>
divya: yeah

[21:56:00.0000] <boblet>
that’d work too

[21:56:01.0000] <divya>
so 3 spaces for IE 2 spaces for FF and 1 each for the rest. 

[21:57:00.0000] <paul_irish>
and a ghost ie5

[21:57:01.0000] <boblet>
:|

[21:58:00.0000] <divya>
paul_irish: whaaaa

[21:58:01.0000] <divya>
In any case I think this should be an 'alternate view' but not default :|

[22:01:00.0000] <boblet>
divya: completely agree. current view is more helpful. ‘locked’ view only good for over-time comparison

[22:02:00.0000] <boblet>
btw you can use numbers in class names if you want ;-) (twenty10 etc is cute tho!)

[22:03:00.0000] <boblet>
s/use numbers in class names/start class names with numbers/

[22:03:01.0000] <boblet>
(read what I thought, not what I typed)

[22:03:02.0000] <boblet>
;-)

[22:04:00.0000] <paul_irish>
you can? whoa sweet

[22:05:00.0000] <boblet>
paul_irish: in HTML5 class/id names can be any unicode character(s) except space

[22:05:01.0000] <boblet>
kanji is fine

[22:05:02.0000] <paul_irish>
beautiful.

[22:05:03.0000] <paul_irish>
does that degrade fine?

[22:06:00.0000] <boblet>
dunno about browser support for crazy things like smileys, but a starting number was only ever a validation issue, and I’ve seen kanji class names over here on live Japanese sites

[22:06:01.0000] <divya>
boblet: woah sweet!

[22:07:00.0000] <boblet>
:)

[22:07:01.0000] <divya>
last time I tried, it didnt detect for ids starting with numbers. Though that was more than a year ago :/

[22:08:00.0000] <boblet>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#classes which links to http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#space-separated-tokens

[22:08:01.0000] <boblet>
“A set of space-separated tokens is a string containing zero or more words separated by one or more space characters, where words consist of any string of one or more characters, none of which are space characters”

[22:09:00.0000] <boblet>
divya: it meaning validator?

[22:10:00.0000] <divya>
boblet: no, the styles did not apply :/

[22:10:01.0000] <divya>
when I did #1 { blah: blah; }

[22:10:02.0000] <boblet>
ohrly!? do you remember which browser?

[22:10:03.0000] <divya>
boblet: wow most likely Firefox but that was a long time ago :/

[22:11:00.0000] <boblet>
crikey, didn’t think browsers would actually enforce that rule. seems pretty brutal

[22:12:00.0000] <boblet>
well, maybe I’m living in a theoretical world then re: starting with a number

[22:12:01.0000] <divya>
boblet: they still dont http://dl.dropbox.com/u/952/random.html

[22:13:00.0000] <boblet>
yeah, I’m finding the same thing ;-(

[22:13:01.0000] <boblet>
jeez, that’s crap

[22:15:00.0000] <divya>
could it be something to do with DOM naming prefs

[22:15:01.0000] <boblet>
sorry for ray of false hope

[22:15:02.0000] <divya>
ROFL

[22:17:00.0000] <paul_irish>
boblet: its up. take a look

[22:19:00.0000] <boblet>
ooo nice jeorb! :)

[22:21:00.0000] <boblet>
btw I tested class and id names with →, ☺ and オ. all worked

[22:22:00.0000] <boblet>
so there’s something about starting numbers huh

[22:22:01.0000] <boblet>
(all worked = latest Chrome, Webkit, Opera, Firefox)

[22:25:00.0000] <divya>
boblet: ha! That is interesting to note :) I sense a blog post :P

[22:25:01.0000] <boblet>
divya: I’ll leave the IE checking to you ;-)

[22:28:00.0000] <divya>
boblet: sheesh The only Windows I have is Vista which eats my battery in 2 mins flat.

[22:30:00.0000] <boblet>
that’s a short window for browser testing

[22:31:00.0000] <boblet>
paul_irish: the JS var twenty10 etc in script.js are how you’re doing the alternate view right?

[22:32:00.0000] <paul_irish>
yup

[22:33:00.0000] <paul_irish>
it looks to see if there isnt a block where it expects one and chucks in a fake one

[22:33:01.0000] <paul_irish>
going one by one through the browsers through the yeras.

[22:34:00.0000] <boblet>
huh. tried to hack a version with all browsers taking a slot on every year, but the script doesn’t seem to work on the locally saved version. maybe b/c Chrome saved the HTML with all-caps tags

[22:37:00.0000] <boblet>
yeah, that was it. wow, I done gone broke it good now tho

[22:38:00.0000] <paul_irish>
while you're at it, size the bars to be representative of browser market share, why dontcha. :)

[22:39:00.0000] <boblet>
sure, right after I pop round to bring you both a cup of tea and a biscuit…

[22:39:01.0000] <divya>
boblet: Earl Grey Pls. :)

[22:41:00.0000] <boblet>
divya: certainly ma’am, although perhaps ma’am would care to try the broken orange pekoe afternoon blend?

[22:42:00.0000] <divya>
boblet: only if it comes with a scone :P

[22:45:00.0000] <boblet>
I’ll just grab some clotted cream, brb

[23:06:00.0000] <annevk>
oh fun, more CORS email

[23:07:00.0000] <annevk>
yawn

[23:18:00.0000] <annevk>
webr3, please raise an issue only once instead of spamming it in every thread

[23:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's the best practice method of constructing an array of sorted strings when you receive them in a random order?

[23:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
collect them out of order then quick sort then remove duplicates?

[23:19:01.0000] <annevk>
webr3, also, it may help to read the archives, the issue you have been raising in about three emails since I was asleep has already been recorded and a solution has already been proposed

[23:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
that seems like it'd be slow

[23:20:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, spec doesn't have to be fast :p

[23:20:01.0000] <annevk>
assuming this is for WebSRT

[23:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm writing code for my game

[23:22:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh, sounded very much like collecting cues and sorting them :)

[23:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
nah

[23:22:02.0000] <annevk>
I guess duplicates should've alarmed me

[23:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
hm, maybe it's better to just put them in an array doing mem moves as i go

[23:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
so they're pre-sorted

[23:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that seems like it'd involve a lot of moves...

[23:49:00.0000] <webr3>
annevk: point taken and I'll check through the archives to see if i can find it

[23:51:00.0000] <webr3>
/me really doesn't want to be sending the mail(s) about CORS or having any worries or issues with it at all :(

[23:56:00.0000] <webr3>
Hixie: transfer them into an array as key's on the way in (rather than values), that'll remove all duplicates without any work

[23:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
"as key's"?

[23:57:01.0000] <webr3>
"string1" = '',

[23:57:02.0000] <webr3>
yeah instead of [] = "string1"

[23:57:03.0000] <webr3>
(depending on length of strings)

[23:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i'm not using javascript

[23:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
this is a compiler language

[00:00:00.0000] <webr3>
non-option then i guess :)

[00:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
also i'm more concerned about the work the computer does than the work i have to do :-)

[00:04:00.0000] <webr3>
probably produce way less op codes, but depending on size of strings etc would have other performance hits

[00:04:01.0000] <webr3>
best of luck though, sure you'll figure it out easily enough (if not already)

[00:46:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9662 -- lol

[00:47:00.0000] <annevk>
it's unfortunate that with the current process that bug may end up escalating to a meaningless vote

[00:47:01.0000] <annevk>
wasting everyone's time for something that will not change

[00:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
at least that's a technical question

[00:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
not as much of a waste of time as what reference to use for ascii

[00:50:00.0000] <annevk>
unlike this one, that one we could actually do something about

[00:50:01.0000] <annevk>
I wonder why Unicode doesn't define ASCII as code points 1-127

[00:50:02.0000] <annevk>
0-127 I mean

[00:52:00.0000] <annevk>
44 new CORS emails since Tuesday in only one of the running threads

[00:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
doesn't seem useful to change it

[00:52:02.0000] <annevk>
(not counting all the duplicates I receive)

[00:53:00.0000] <annevk>
also, nothing new (the claim about new is not accurate, it's simply not done)

[00:54:00.0000] <annevk>
and to be honest I'm not really sure what to say in the security section

[00:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: if I had time I would volunteer to write a draft of a security section

[00:55:01.0000] <annevk>
I suppose I could expand the sentence on validation saying you shouldn't just pass on everything from origin a to c via yourself, b

[00:55:02.0000] <annevk>
but in the end developers won't read CORS

[00:57:00.0000] <webr3>
annevk: if it helps, I think they will

[00:58:00.0000] <webr3>
/me is a developer, /me read it

[01:00:00.0000] <annevk>
sure a couple might

[01:00:01.0000] <annevk>
s/might/will/

[01:00:02.0000] <annevk>
but most won't

[01:00:03.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I think security considerations should cover the following things:

[01:00:04.0000] <othermaciej>
1) Two-party interactions

[01:00:05.0000] <othermaciej>
2) Three-party interactions - potential for Confused Deputy risk in this scenario

[01:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
3) Ways to avoid Confused Deputy - validate inputs before retransmitting, distinguish requests made on behalf of third parties in your protocol, or use secret tokens in combination with CORS for services to be used cooperatively

[01:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
4) How you can use CORS combined with secret tokens to get a stronger defense than either separately, even for two-party interactions

[01:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess security considerations should also discuss the no-credentials mode of CORS, since that is in the CORS spec

[01:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and I guess there should be a list of potential pitfalls for implementors to watch out for, I think

[01:03:02.0000] <annevk>
there's http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/access-control/#user-agent-security

[01:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that seems to be a good start on the UA issues

[01:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I could write at least a rough outline for the 4 things I mentioned

[01:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
not sure I have time to draft final text

[01:05:01.0000] <annevk>
a draft might be enough for me to finish it

[01:06:00.0000] <annevk>
the outline sounds good, i'm just not sure how to fill them in... :/

[01:11:00.0000] <webr3>
annevk: (i hate to ask, honestly) - if the headers (i mean the allowed headers) from UMP where added to CORS and it was sealed at that, would the vendors be happy / could it go through to rec. (security section aside) - hixie replied "I'm not familiar with the browser vendor opinions on this specific issue." - perhaps you know, or could ask /end - i swear I'll never mention CORS again

[01:12:00.0000] <webr3>
mhausenblas: morning :)

[01:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd like to provide some text for xhr's intro section that talks about how to safely do some common things that tyler thinks are dangerous, but i haven't been able to figure out what that is exactly

[01:13:01.0000] <mhausenblas>
morning webr3 

[01:13:02.0000] <annevk>
webr3, I don't understand

[01:15:00.0000] <webr3>
annevk: CORS limits to 5 headers, UMP allows more headers (Location etc) still a whitelist, but also allows Uniform-Headers = "Uniform-Headers" ":" 1#field-name - basically http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/UMP/#response-header-filtering section 4.2 only - could that be added to CORS [/me would be happy could work with that, under current setup i/we simply can't)

[01:15:01.0000] <webr3>
s/5/6

[01:17:00.0000] <annevk>
I thought I already told you it's an open issue

[01:17:01.0000] <annevk>
And you already raised it more than once on the mailing list

[01:18:00.0000] <annevk>
patience

[01:18:01.0000] <webr3>
okay I'll take you at your word it's being handled & leave it there

[01:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
CORS has a way to allow additional request headers

[01:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
does it not have a way to expose additional response headers yet?

[01:19:02.0000] <annevk>
not yet, I'm waiting for whether we want to rename the headers or not

[01:19:03.0000] <annevk>
so far nobody replied so I guess we won't

[01:20:00.0000] <annevk>
(and by nobody I mean affected browser vendors)

[01:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
what kind of replies are you looking for?

[01:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I'd rather not change them unless the new names are a huge improvement

[01:20:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I won't object if other vendors want to change

[01:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(we could always support the old names too for a transition period)

[01:21:01.0000] <annevk>
something like 1) looks great lets do it 2) if you change that proposed syntax to this lets do it 3) not worth the change 4) looks great, but only if Mozilla/WebKit makes the changes too

[01:22:00.0000] <annevk>
something like that

[01:22:01.0000] <annevk>
see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2010AprJun/thread.html#msg508 othermaciej

[01:22:02.0000] <annevk>
oops http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2010AprJun/0508.html (there's no thread)

[01:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh, I see

[01:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does that cover all the headers that start with "Accesss-Cotrol-"?

[01:24:01.0000] <annevk>
yup

[01:24:02.0000] <annevk>
only "Origin" remains unchanged, effectively

[01:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"CORS" seems a bit mysterious as a header name, but I do like getting rid of the obsolete Access-Control

[01:27:00.0000] <annevk>
I couldn't really think of something better

[01:27:01.0000] <annevk>
"http cors" or some such would be easy to find though

[01:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm writing up my thoughts in email

[01:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
my ideas so far:

[01:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
CORS ==> Allow-Access

[01:28:03.0000] <othermaciej>
CORS-Methods ==> Allow-Methods

[01:28:04.0000] <othermaciej>
CORS-Headers ==> Allow-Headers

[01:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
can't think of a good name for CORS-preflight

[01:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe Allow-Request-Headers to make space for the response version

[01:29:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or perhaps that one could be Reveal-Headers

[01:30:00.0000] <annevk>
Expose-Headers was my idea

[01:30:01.0000] <annevk>
CORS-Expose-Headers

[01:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I like Expose better than Reveal

[01:30:03.0000] <webr3>
annevk: perfect, anything like that

[01:30:04.0000] <annevk>
Allow-Access is not really accurate though, it's not really about granting access

[01:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
isn't it?

[01:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that header is what the browser uses to determine whether to expose the response, right?

[01:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe it should be Expose-Response

[01:31:03.0000] <annevk>
that's an interesting one

[01:31:04.0000] <othermaciej>
unless it's also used for other purposes

[01:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can't we stop renaming things and let the platform stablilize?

[01:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't really want to rename things

[01:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the Access-Control-* names are not so great, but not so terrible I feel compelled to change

[01:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but others did raise the idea of change, so I'd like to propose good names in case we choose to do it

[01:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: maybe (in this hypothetical renamed world) it should be Expose-Response in response to an actual request, and Allow-Access in response to a preflight

[01:35:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe Allow-Request?

[01:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
for the preflight response that makes sense

[01:36:00.0000] <annevk>
and Preflight-For or some such instead of CORS-preflight

[01:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure that makes things more clear

[01:37:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[01:38:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, this part of the platform is not stable

[01:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: self-fulfilling statement

[01:39:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, but I'm not that keen on it either but since mnot argued quite strongly that the header names were too long and all I thought I should at least give it a chance

[01:39:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, guess I'm mostly where othermaciej is with this

[01:39:03.0000] <webr3>
maybe mnot was challenge you to get as short as his "link" header

[01:40:00.0000] <webr3>
/me chuckles

[01:40:01.0000] <annevk>
dunno, but "his" link header is around since HTTP 1.0

[01:40:02.0000] <webr3>
... k

[01:43:00.0000] <webr3>
fwiw.. i kinda like the "new header to expose more response headers ==> Expose-Headers (or Expose-Response-Headers)" idea :)

[01:43:01.0000] <webr3>
/me runs

[01:46:00.0000] <annevk>
my google Buzz stream is nothing but my twitter/Flickr account and the twitter account of Sjoerd Visscher

[01:47:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess Buzz has failed; at least in my universe

[01:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
people think of google-branded services as trustworthy private space. when google-branded services behave like facebook, it feels creepy

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
google search is a private space?

[01:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[01:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: people think their search terms are

[01:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah, fair enough

[01:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
facebook doesn't tend to broadcast your info though

[01:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the buzz privacy debacle was totally different from the facebook privacy debacle

[01:54:00.0000] <annevk>
facebook exposes more and more

[01:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
some private info was broadcast to the general public (perhaps partly by accident) as opposed to facebook which is giving your private data to business partners or people you don't know, in contravention of the expectations it set originally

[01:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess both cases come down to violating previously established expectations

[01:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
buzz was fixed pretty damn quick though

[01:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: both debacles arise from similar actions but people thought google wouldn't do such a thing

[01:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
facebook's on the other hand seems to be intentional

[01:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
not that i'm trying to defend google

[01:55:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: where as facebook has... let's say a different reputation

[01:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
google did do a better job of reacting to the outcry

[01:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I thought the buzz thing was an intentional greed-driven attempt to compete with facebook in their game

[01:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I've always assumed that Google only cares about my privacy to the extent it helps foster their self-image as doing no evil

[01:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: buzz in general as a feature - yes

[01:57:02.0000] <annevk>
isn't buzz competing with twitter?

[01:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me decides to let his PR department handle the issue, since this is logged

[01:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
buzz being shoved in, in a way that exposed personal information, that may have been intentional but it didn't seem very clearly thought out

[01:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: twitter is pretty clear about what's public and what's private--unlike facebook

[02:09:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, the date on the January 1 2006 archive copy is a copypasta error: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/

[02:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
fixed thanks

[03:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I don't know if you saw my discussion with Ville on the validator mailing list, but people have been reporting unexpected EOF errors when using it 

[03:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I remember now I mentioned this to you earlier

[03:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't get any errors if I post (using curl) from the shell to localhost port 8888 

[03:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but in browsing through the log output for the instance, I do see EOF errors being logged 

[03:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
with the root cause being this:

[03:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Caused by: java.net.SocketException: Broken pipe

[03:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>

[03:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, if not the root cause, at least the lowest-level error that's causing the EOF

[03:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: see http://pastebin.org/229072 for the full record of the error

[03:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I suspect this is just due to excessive load on the validator hosts, and that causing a timeout or something

[03:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Store the incoming strings in a hashmap (which will remove duplicates, total cost O(n) in the total number of strings), then extract and sort all the keys at the end (O(n log n) in the number of unique strings) - I can't imagine any way to be asymptotically faster than that

[03:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what was the problem?

[03:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100513#l-177

[03:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh I see

[03:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, that would be the best way

[03:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
unique in O(N) with O(N) space, sort in O(N log N)

[03:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there's no way to beat N log N by putting things in the right place, because any data structure that sorts on insertion would take O(N log N) time to build

[04:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: validator.w3.org updated to latest upstream v.nu (SVG and MathML in text/html)

[04:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
also updated http://www.w3.org/html/check (but that is running my workspace code)

[04:44:00.0000] <annevk>
/me is even less of a fan of this hybi experiment now

[04:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk: What is it that's being overengineered this time?

[04:58:00.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, process :)

[05:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh boy

[05:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Because it wasn't slow enough already?

[05:02:00.0000] <annevk>
more layers is better

[05:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is there a requirements specification for how to decide on a proper definition of 'better'?

[05:05:00.0000] <annevk>
drafting one as we speak

[05:05:01.0000] <annevk>
though getting consensus on it might implode the WG

[05:05:02.0000] <annevk>
and the interwebs

[05:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's a feature

[05:06:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Makes it easier to transition to new protocols when there's no legacy around

[05:06:02.0000] <annevk>
you're on to something here

[05:07:00.0000] <annevk>
then we could finally deploy XHTML2

[05:07:01.0000] <annevk>
and Cookie2

[05:07:02.0000] <annevk>
and XSL:FO

[05:07:03.0000] <annevk>
and lots of other X-based specifications

[05:07:04.0000] <annevk>
the web would reborn

[05:07:05.0000] <annevk>
magical

[06:45:00.0000] <annevk>
"I'm afraid that is too meta-physical for me.  I've been asked to edit the requirements document as part of the IETF process and that's what I'm attempting to do." is it just me or is the obvious follow-up question asking if he wants to jump in the pond?

[06:45:01.0000] <annevk>
incidentally, i recall Steven Pemberton justifying working on XHTML2 in much the same way

[07:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/05/12/BUPJ1DDISH.DTL - "In a full-page ad [...] Adobe says, we love [...] HTML5"

[07:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sadly can't find the actual ad

[07:40:01.0000] <annevk>
would be fun to see a picture of the ad, indeed

[07:50:00.0000] <krijnh>
Hey, this HTML5 thing.. Do you guys think this is going to be a mainstream thing? I really have my doubts about it!

[07:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't know about this HTML5 thing

[07:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
That other HTML5 thing is pretty popular, though

[07:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
The one that's made up of CSS3 and Geolocation and so on

[07:51:03.0000] <krijnh>
I heard HTML5 also included Flash 10.1 in some definitions..

[07:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It needs a better acronym, there's no X

[07:58:00.0000] <annevk>
i know i know, XHTML5!

[08:00:00.0000] <krijnh>
That's not catchy enough

[08:05:00.0000] <annevk>
the adobe stuff might be http://www.adobe.com/choice/ ?

[08:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: That and the ads seem to be part of the current Adobe-vs-Apple battle

[08:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's a nice battle since it's about who's the most open and most supportive of open standards like HTML5

[08:12:00.0000] <krijnh>
I thought it was about who was most open about H.264 :)

[08:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's about who has the stronger RDF

[10:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: you around?

[10:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Because I'm biased towards linked lists, just do insertion sort as each comes in.  Worst case in n^2 time, but with a standard fairly uniform distibution of values it'll be fine, and dupe elimination comes along for free.

[10:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Average case is O(n^2) time too

[10:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm, yeah, you're right, since on average you'll just be adding it to the middle.

[10:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you have n total and m unique it'll be O(nm), vs O(n + m log m) for the hash/sort method, which isn't so good if m and n are large

[10:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and if they're not large then you wouldn't worry about performance at all)

[10:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That then brings up the obvious question of, how large is it?

[10:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
->                <- this large

[10:33:00.0000] <ment>
Hixie: i would go with path-compressed tries. http://cr.yp.to/critbit.html

[10:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You have to ensure that what you have is prefix-free in that case, though (which it likely is).

[10:43:00.0000] <ment>
TabAtkins: or you can just store strings with some kind of terminating character at the end (nul-byte in case of cstrings)

[13:30:00.0000] <annevk>
btw, karaoke plus ruby

[13:30:01.0000] <annevk>
http://www.flickr.com/photos/annevk/4601462252/

[13:30:02.0000] <annevk>
including that animated effect with the letters

[13:30:03.0000] <annevk>
guess we'll need some new CSS features for that

[13:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, that wiping effect?  Yeah, I've seen that in karaoke a lot.

[13:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If we ever decide to handle that, though, it's certainly something just on the CSS side, with no effect on the captioning format, like you said.

[14:29:00.0000] <paul_irish>
Philip`: there were some reports of your font optimizer POST table mods messing with the printability.

[14:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
paul_irish: That's not unexpected

[14:33:01.0000] <paul_irish>
:) ok

[14:36:00.0000] <aho>
slightly off topic perhaps, but does anyone know why there isn't "rgba(#abc, 0.5)"?

[14:36:01.0000] <aho>
i'd happily trade that for that silly version which takes percentages :>

[14:36:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because people hate #rgb notation.  ;_;

[14:36:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I and a few other people have been regularly arguing for an #rgba notation.

[14:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/people hate/some browser implementors/

[14:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't care whether I use hex or decimal, as long as I don't have to convert between them.

[14:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Because some browser implementors #rgb notation.  ;_;"

[14:37:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've used hex colors for so long that I think about color in hex at this point.

[14:37:04.0000] <aho>
AryehGregor, well currently you do have to convert between them

[14:37:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: So I write broken regexps.  ^_^

[14:38:00.0000] <aho>
i.e. you got some color in hex... and now you'd like to have it somewhat translucent

[14:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: my N is low (1<=N<100) so the contant factors of setting up a hashmap seem high... isn't it just as easy and efficient to just build an array using binary search to find where to put things and a mem copy to move things around?

[14:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But yeah, aho, I'm still trying to get #rgba added to the Color module, so we can write #06c8 and similar.

[14:39:00.0000] <aho>
that would be awesome

[14:39:01.0000] <aho>
:)~

[14:39:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Are you locked to an array, or can you use a linked list?

[14:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: If N < 100 then why are you caring about performance at all?

[14:39:04.0000] <aho>
i'd be also fine with something like rgba(#abc,0.5) though

[14:39:05.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: how do i search a linked list?

[14:39:06.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: there's a lot of them

[14:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
A lot of what?

[14:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: I don't understand the context of that question.

[14:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: lists to sort

[14:40:03.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, lots of short lists?

[14:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: how do i construct the linked list in a sorted manner without walking on average half the list each time?

[14:40:05.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yeah

[14:40:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
You don't.  You just do insertion sort and eat that cost, because the constant factors are low and the asymptotic behavior is irrelevant for such small cases.

[14:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i have a bunch of trees that contain strings, and for each tree i have to construct a sorted array of strings

[14:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: i have an irrational aversion to searching for things by just walking a list :-)

[14:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
About hashmaps, "just as easy" depends on what language/library functionality you have available

[14:41:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Stop being irrational, then.

[14:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[14:41:05.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. std::unordered_set<std::wstring> is trivial in C++ and writing code for an explicit binary search takes much more effort

[14:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, what are the objections to the #rgba syntax?

[14:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Man, I dunno.  Let me dig up the thread for you.

[14:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't quite sure if it's really called std::unordered_set

[14:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: code writinge effort in this case is not an isue

[14:42:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, hard to tell at a glance whether something has three/four/six/eight characters after the #.  Will take a long time to be usable compatibly.

[14:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The latter is probably the main objection, since it's a convenience feature.  I think it's pretty easy to tell 3/4/6/8 apart, though.

[14:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: So "easy" is irrelevant?

[14:43:02.0000] <Lachy>
that last argument is bogus. It will just take longer if they keep delaying it.

[14:43:03.0000] <Lachy>
But I suppose the quickest way to get it in, is for some browser to implement it

[14:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Just write up a few possibilities and time.  With lists that small constant factors that you have little control of will dominate, and so if you need efficiency you'll need to discover it experimentally.

[14:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Get to it.

[14:44:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me wonders who's the right person to ping for that on chrome team...

[14:45:00.0000] <aho>
<AryehGregor> Lachy, hard to tell at a glance whether something has three/four/six/eight characters after the #.  <- well, rgba(#f00,0.4) is pretty easy to read and it's also very obvious :>

[14:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Actually, I think the main objection was that it would slow Color3's progression.  Getting two of us to implement would kill that argument.

[14:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yeah

[14:46:01.0000] <aho>
(personally i also got somewhat used to using a normalized value for the alpha)

[14:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i'm just looking for something cheap in cpu and memory

[14:46:03.0000] <Lachy>
if distingishing 3/4/6/8 chars is the main objection, then maybe (though I think this is less ideal) the syntax could be like #369/A

[14:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: primarily cpu

[14:46:05.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: for 1<=N<100

[14:46:06.0000] <Philip`>
How long are the strings?

[14:46:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, that wouldn't conflict with other uses of /?

[14:47:00.0000] <aho>
i'd be also fine with that

[14:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
not in the color properties.

[14:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even in shorthand properties?

[14:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: yeah, probably

[14:47:04.0000] <Lachy>
The / is used in 'font', where it wouldn't conflict

[14:47:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Rereading the latest thread on it, it appears the objections were (1) too late for Colors 3, it would slow down progression for a mere convenience feature, and (2) some implementors don't like #rgb notation at all, and so don't particular care to increase the usefulness of that syntax

[14:47:06.0000] <aho>
i don't really care... as long as i don't have to convert to dec or percentages (wtf) anymore, i'm fine

[14:47:07.0000] <Philip`>
It seems possible that string comparisons would be the most expensive operation so you'd want to minimise those

[14:47:08.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: 1<=len(S)<20

[14:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, have you considered just buying better hardware?  :)

[14:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
#rgb syntax is far superior to rgb() syntax for authors.;

[14:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
and shuffling smallarrays of pointers would be very quick

[14:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: actually not an option in this case, but in any case it's more of a theoretical issue :-)

[14:48:04.0000] <Philip`>
s/la/l a/

[14:48:05.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: true

[14:48:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Yeah, I agree.  Shrug.  So go ping whoever you need to at Opera and get it in.  ^_^

[14:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm surprised there isn't a well-known algorithm to solve this like there is for sorting constructed lists

[14:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe that means a trie would be best, since you'd only need to examine each character of an incoming string once, instead of comparing it against many others

[14:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
ooh, that's an interesting idea

[14:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
hadn't thought of that

[14:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I think I know who's job it would be to implement it, but he's currently assigned to other tasks and has other more important tasks scheduled. But I'll see what I can do

[14:50:03.0000] <Philip`>
(ment already suggested a trie variant)

[14:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Trie would probably be fine, since you won't be doing any more pointer-chasing than you would with a linked list, and the savings in comparisons might be significant.

[14:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yeah, i had opened the page he suggested but not read it yet :-)

[14:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
Since there's not much data it'd all fit in L1 and pointers shouldn't be too expensive, I guess

[14:52:02.0000] <aho>
#abcd #aabbccdd #abc/d #aabbcc/dd ... hmm... i think i prefer the one with slash a little bit

[14:52:03.0000] <aho>
but the pure one is fine too

[14:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What's an average size for L1 caches these days?

[14:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, I was wracking my brain for something I remembered for quickly sorting an array as it's built, but just realized that the algo I'm thinking of is for quickly *shuffling* an array as it is built.

[14:55:01.0000] <aho>
64 kb + 64 kb (data + instructions) per core, i guess

[14:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, that's just fine then.  With roughly 100 strings of 20 characters or less each, that's about 2k of data per set.  So yeah, everything fits in L1 no problem.

[14:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't like that the A in the rgba() function syntax has a different scale than the other components

[14:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think it's pretty dumb that <alphavalue> is restricted to being a number in [0.0,1.0], and can't be a percentage like the other colors.

[14:59:00.0000] <aho>
i never used percentages for colors

[14:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_(microarchitecture) says "32 KB L1 instruction and 32 KB L1 data cache per core; 256 KB L2 cache per core; 4–12 MB L3 cache shared by all cores"

[15:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: You have to count all the pointers too, which are probably going to be larger than the actual character data

[15:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
but it sounds like it still wouldn't be a problem

[15:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
so there's no need to worry too much about optimising memory usage

[15:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm?  A pointer is 4-8 bytes.  The strings will be 1-40 bytes, depending on encoding.

[15:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
(8 bytes, in this architecture)

[15:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
If it's a simple trie then I guess you need at least a pointer per node, which in the worst case is one per character

[15:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, right, per trie node.  Yeah, then the pointers are more expensive.

[15:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes it when he can make code faster just by rearranging data and not having to do anything complicated like think about algorithms

[15:05:00.0000] <ment>
what problem are you trying to solve?

[15:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
ment: the same one i mentioned earlier

[15:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: for a trie, it seems you need some sort of dictionary structure per node

[15:12:00.0000] <ment>
Hixie: i still haven't understand why don't you just sort them with qsort?

[15:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if you want to sort N items, just sort them

[15:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
N log N is pretty good

[15:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
qsort has good constants

[15:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
Depends if there's going to be lots of duplicates you want to get rid of before sorting

[15:13:02.0000] <ment>
why not remove duplicates _after_ sorting?

[15:13:03.0000] <othermaciej>
or use heapsort if you need very little memory

[15:13:04.0000] <othermaciej>
if you want to remove duplicates before sorting, just use a hashset

[15:13:05.0000] <othermaciej>
O(N) in number of entries

[15:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there's no way to sort and unique a list of strings that is faster than O(N log N)

[15:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(unless they are fixed length, then you can use a radix sort to sort I guess)

[15:14:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ha, beat me to it.

[15:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
ment: You might find everything is a duplicate of a single value in O(N) time, and then you avoid the whole O(N log N) sort

[15:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Strings can be treated as fixed-length if you already know the longest length, and treat non-existent characters as sorted before any actual characters.

[15:15:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"I'm not *strongly* opposed to the concepts that these semantic elements, attributes and controls add, but I do think that, in order to actually reach a W3C standard quickly, controversial additions that are likely to slow down progress or result in poor interoperability should be removed from the specification so that the W3C HTML working group can reach closure quickly."

[15:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is it just me, or is this kind of statement usually a self-fulfilling prophecy?

[15:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
ment: constructing an array, then sorting it, then removing duplicates, seems like something that could be optimised further

[15:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: that would be O(N * MAXLEN), so unless MAXLEN is much less than log N it doesn't much help

[15:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: is your input streaming in, or is it already in memory?

[15:16:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: You don't need a dictionary for a trie.  It's just a normal tree, with each link representing a single element of the lists.

[15:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
a trie is still essentially N log N

[15:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
ment: i'm just surprised there aren't well-established algorithms for doing this :-)

[15:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
don't use a fancy data structure when a simple one would do

[15:17:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Right, but it's fun!

[15:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: how do you store the connections at each node?

[15:17:05.0000] <ment>
Philip`: first, there's three-way qsort. second, you would need a really large amount of data with duplicates to speed things up (it would only complicate the code)

[15:17:06.0000] <othermaciej>
there are - unique using a dictionary, then sort using a common sort

[15:17:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: An array of pointers.

[15:17:08.0000] <ment>
Hixie: there are! qsort :)

[15:17:09.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it's in memory (in a tree data structure)

[15:17:10.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: what kind of tree?

[15:17:11.0000] <Hixie>
ment: for constructing the array while sorting it, i mean

[15:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: on what axis are you asking for the trees to be described?

[15:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if the tree is indexed by the string in question, then an inorder traversal will give you back the strings in sorted order

[15:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: then you're back to walking a list to find things :-P

[15:18:03.0000] <ment>
Hixie: do you need it to be 1) with low latency (and with intermidiate results available) 2) able to cope with large amount of data 3) high speed ... ? just give some conditions

[15:18:04.0000] <othermaciej>
that's O(N)

[15:18:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: any - "it's a tree" is very little information

[15:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Hm?  No, if you have a set alphabet the strings are constructed from, you just make an array of that size and you can grab the appropriate one with a simple index.

[15:19:01.0000] <ment>
othermaciej: trie is not 'N log N', trie is O(1) if implemented right

[15:19:02.0000] <ment>
erm, O(N)

[15:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
is it a binary tree? a b-tree? something else? are these the strings to the key or not?

[15:19:04.0000] <othermaciej>
ment: building the trie isn't O(N)

[15:20:00.0000] <ment>
othermaciej: erm I mean O(N) where N is sum of lenghts of the keys

[15:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it's just a regular tree, like a DOM tree; the strings are just annotations at each node and have nothing to do with the structure of the tree

[15:20:02.0000] <ment>
othermaciej: but you wouldn't get better result with sort anyway as comparsion or varlen keys isn't really O(1) 

[15:20:03.0000] <ment>
*of

[15:20:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: so my suggestion is, make an array and a set, visit each tree node, check if string is in set, if not, append to the array

[15:20:05.0000] <othermaciej>
then sort the array

[15:20:06.0000] <othermaciej>
if that is too slow or uses too much memory, then you can worry about whether you need a fancy algorithm

[15:20:07.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: um, i'm not creeating a 256-entry (or 0x10FFFF-entry!) array at each node of a trie, that would take insane amounts of memory :-P

[15:21:00.0000] <ment>
Hixie: my suggestion is qsort it, then remove the duplicates

[15:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sorting before removing duplicates could use less memory in theory but is probably slower

[15:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
man creating an array then sorting it seems so silly

[15:21:03.0000] <ment>
you don't have to, you can save the state-transition table in hashmap :)

[15:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
ment: that's what i said earlier

[15:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
ment: each node of a trie requires some sort of dictionary

[15:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Heh, just estimate the minimum and maximum character used and establish an array that wide.

[15:22:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: you could build a balanced binary tree instead, but then building the tree takes longer than building the array + sorting the array

[15:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
ment: TabAtkins was disagreeing

[15:22:04.0000] <ment>
but you can use one dictionary for all states

[15:22:05.0000] <othermaciej>
basic rule of programming: never use a fancy data structure when a simple one would do

[15:22:06.0000] <ment>
and access it with composed key (state, char)

[15:22:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Though a linked list of pointers would be better, since it will be sparse past the root node.

[15:22:08.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm just surprised there isn't some variant on sorting algorithms that basically sorts as the array is constructed instead of doing it as a two-step process

[15:22:09.0000] <othermaciej>
if you haven't tried the simple solution first, you are wasting all our time and are a bad software engineer

[15:23:00.0000] <ment>
Hixie: it is :) insert sort

[15:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: a balanced binary tree self-sorts, but it's not really faster

[15:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
ment: insertion sort still acts on a pre-built array unless we're talking about different things

[15:23:03.0000] <othermaciej>
true, insertion sort will do it, but that's O(N^2)

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i agree entirely that using complex data structures is silly here, hence my pushback on the ideas of using tries and so forth

[15:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you can use insertion sort in the course of inserting

[15:24:02.0000] <ment>
Hixie: no, you walk down sorted list and insert it before first larger key

[15:24:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: why your pushback on building an array and then sorting it then?

[15:24:04.0000] <othermaciej>
that's the obvious CS101 solution

[15:24:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: No, insertion sort works fine.  That's why I suggested it beforehand.  ^_^  You need a linked list, not an array, though, to avoid data-moving penalties.

[15:24:06.0000] <othermaciej>
if you haven't tried that, you are wasting all our time

[15:24:07.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: no push back there, i'm just saying i'm surprised there's no better solution

[15:24:08.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it's basically what i had gotten to before asking here

[15:24:09.0000] <othermaciej>
sorting is N log N

[15:24:10.0000] <ment>
TabAtkins: data moving while traversing is cheap

[15:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(unless you have a special case amenable to radix sort or the like)

[15:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
ment: walking the whole list each time just seems obviously suboptimal

[15:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
or half the list

[15:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
on average

[15:25:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
ment: Not in the situation you'd have here, where you would traverse part of the array, and then ahve to move the rest.

[15:25:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
ment: That's guaranteeing a full-price n^2 cost.

[15:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
insertion sort is a poor solution here

[15:26:01.0000] <ment>
TabAtkins: what if you move while traversing from the back?

[15:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
one O(N^2) pass is not better than an O(N) pass followed by an O(N log N) pass

[15:26:03.0000] <ment>
Hixie: do you need it to be high-speed for 10000 or more keys?

[15:26:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: It is if the N is very small (which it is here, roughly 100 strings).

[15:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Or rather, it can be, if the constant factors are small enough for the n^2.

[15:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
they are not smaller than the constant factors for vector append and quicksort

[15:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and if your problem set size is 100, then if you are spending time optimizing it at all you're probably wasting effort

[15:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Individual problems are roughly 100, but if you have a bunch of problems like that then optimization can make sense.

[15:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(unless you do it over and over)

[15:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
optimization doesn't make sense until you measure

[15:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But really, I said before that at problem sizes this small you can't establish efficiency through theory, and really just need to do timings.

[15:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me wasn't trying to optimise, just asking if there was some obvious solution intended for this case that he was overlooking :-)

[15:29:03.0000] <othermaciej>
you already found the obvious solution

[15:29:04.0000] <Hixie>
apparently

[15:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there may be marginally faster solutions depending on context, but none of them are obvious, and the obvious solution is not at all bad

[15:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
The obvious solution is always some combination of sorts and trees and hashmaps, whatever the problem is

[15:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
and usually works well enough

[15:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sometimes you need a crazy data structure

[15:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not often though

[15:31:02.0000] <ment>
sometimes you need word-encoded hash-table indexed by tree shape

[15:32:00.0000] <ment>
btw do css* working groups have irc channels?

[15:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Overoptimisation of underspecified problems is always fun, though

[15:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
ment: We have #css on the w3 server, but that's not really for CSS discussion, just working group stuff.

[15:35:00.0000] <ment>
ah, i was looking for a place where i can threaten people designing new css3 collection of specs

[15:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which specs?  I can be threatened here without you having to lift an additional finger.

[16:12:00.0000] <volkmar>
in html4, legend elements had an align attribute they don't have anymore in html5, that's a regression or i'm missing something ?

[16:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
use CSS

[16:25:00.0000] <volkmar>
othermaciej: i don't know the policy about backward compatibility but that means someone using "aglign=bottom" (don't know if that's valid) which should do something with HTML4 will do nothing with HTML5

[16:26:00.0000] <volkmar>
imo, that's an issue

[16:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
look in the "obsolete features" section

[16:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's defined there

[16:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
and in the rendering section

[16:34:00.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Can I do something like this?

[16:34:01.0000] <KaOSoFt>
<label for="candidato">Primer grupo</label>

[16:34:02.0000] <KaOSoFt>
<img alt="Fotograf�as de Tal persona y tal persona" height="240" id="candidato" src="grupo.jpg" width="320" />

[16:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
volkmar: it's supported but not valid

[16:35:00.0000] <volkmar>
othermaciej: ok, then that's the backward policy: supported but not valid

[16:35:01.0000] <volkmar>
thanks :)

[16:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's true for a lot of things in HTML5

[17:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Adobe is getting really worked up about this Apple thing.

[17:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It surprises me.

[17:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why don't they just avoid having anything to do with Apple and move on?  Is a PR campaign going to help them in any way?

[18:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Maybe the hope is that they will convince Apple customers to demand Flash support so strongly that Apple has to give in

[18:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
Flash only works because it's ubiquitous, and if it doesn't work on iPhones then it will no longer be ubiquitous and so it will be hugely less useful, and so they have to try hard to fight against that

[18:26:00.0000] <jwm>
hehe

[18:26:01.0000] <jwm>
web tech just needs a kick in the butt

[18:26:02.0000] <jwm>
adobe should try to just support the web tech instead

[18:26:03.0000] <jwm>
but whatever

[00:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hi y'all.

[00:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
brucel was asking me about changing the "untilted section" in the outliner, on grounds that a lot of people take that to mean that nav/aside/etc. must have headings. Ideas? Thoughts?

[00:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
for nav, you could call it Navigation instead of Untitled

[00:40:01.0000] <nimbu>
gsnedders:  please do! It makes me feel like my code is incorrect :(

[00:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: And aside?

[00:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: Sidebar?

[00:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess I could special case article as well

[00:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Untitled Sidebar, or Sidebar? I'm really quite fond of making it explicit why it's giving that text

[00:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's the use case for your tool?

[00:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
People wanting to see what outline their page creates for the purposes of ensuring they get the outline they expect from their markup

[00:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd expect a UI to not distinguish fake headings from real headings

[00:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
so if you're tryign to emulate a UI...

[00:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm not sure whether I should emulate a UI or whether I should show explicitly what is fake and what is not for the sake of helping developers…

[00:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
you could just style fake headings differently

[01:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. the string "XHTML5" is nowhere to be found in current-work/

[01:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: what's up with that?

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
where should it appear?

[02:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
The string "HTML5" doesn't really appear either

[02:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
only in examples, references to other specifications, and text talking about the history or talking about what is or isn't html5

[02:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
whatwg has moved on from (x)html5

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: well, I expected it to occur *somewhere*

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I was looking for spec text binding the definition of "XHTML5" to the content type

[02:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
XHTML5 is obsolete from the point of view of the whatwg spec

[02:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I see

[02:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
so it wouldn't be bound to anything

[02:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
the content type binds to just "xhtml"

[02:06:05.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[02:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#application/xhtml+xml

[02:12:00.0000] <annevk>
it should prolly just bind to XML as binding to XHTML has hopefully no special side effects

[02:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
it pretty much does, see the link above

[02:14:00.0000] <annevk>
ah right

[02:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's a shame that the XHTML entity hack is tied to the doctype instead of the MIME type

[02:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: binding it to the MIME type would be wrong per XML

[02:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I'm speaking here in terms of what approach would yield more practical benefits, rather than what approach has greater XML-theoretical purity

[02:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
my bad

[02:24:00.0000] <annevk>
volkmar, regarding the form="" attribute email; you can implement things however you wish, as long as they're in line with the spec

[02:25:00.0000] <annevk>
MIME type would be annoying too

[02:25:01.0000] <annevk>
MIME types are wrong for XML in general

[02:25:02.0000] <annevk>
What MIME type to use if you mix SVG and XHTML?

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
mime types are wrong in general

[02:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would pick whichever is the root element

[02:26:02.0000] <annevk>
If it were to depend on the root element your entities plan would already fail

[02:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
magic strings would hae been better

[02:26:04.0000] <annevk>
Yeah

[02:26:05.0000] <Hixie>
(reliably magic strings, not the sniffing crap we have ended up with)

[02:26:06.0000] <othermaciej>
in the current environment anyway

[02:26:07.0000] <othermaciej>
agree, in-band typing is batter

[02:26:08.0000] <othermaciej>
but it's hard to do effectively and soundly in text-based formats

[02:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
*better

[02:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
not really

[02:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
look at cache manifests

[02:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
they haveone

[02:27:04.0000] <othermaciej>
the collision with text/plain is the problem

[02:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if text/plain had its own distinct magic string the approach would be viable, but it doesn't, and can validly include any imaginable text-based magic string

[02:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
in this world there is no text/plain

[02:31:01.0000] <annevk>
<plaintext> :)

[02:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
since text/plain is a mime type

[02:32:00.0000] <annevk>
the WebSocket over TLS sounds somewhat nice

[02:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
how would one serve plain text content in this world?

[02:32:02.0000] <annevk>
with a non-TLS-HTTP fallback that's even simpler than with the current handshake

[02:32:03.0000] <othermaciej>
TLS-only sounds like the sanest solution so far

[02:32:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I still haven't heard a compelling use case for a non-TLS version

[02:32:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: either use <plaintext> as anne suggested, or just rely on it not having a matching magic string

[02:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me is really not eager to require people understand TLS libraries

[02:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: did you see the 15-line TLS echo server I posted in Python?

[02:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
SPDY is TLS-only, right?

[02:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
python isn't the only language

[02:33:04.0000] <othermaciej>
granted, you'd need to understand a tiny bit more TLS to use whatever library's support for connego

[02:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sure, but it's a good example of a modern, well-maintained language of interest to "hobbyists"

[02:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
the thing with TLS is that to use it safely you can't just rely on a vague understanding

[02:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I imagine Ruby and Perl have libraries that are similar in spirit

[02:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
you have to worry about certs and all kinds of crap

[02:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: PHP isn't great for maintaining persistent connections anyway

[02:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's trivial to misconfigure this kind of thing

[02:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: php isn't great for much of anything

[02:35:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Adam's proposal was that wss: would use full TLS for real, and ws: would allow unverified certs and not really be secure

[02:35:05.0000] <othermaciej>
(thus making it no worse than using a non-SSL solution)

[02:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm pretty sure i could implement websocket as it stands today in pretty much any unix-based language, including probably shell scripting

[02:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
of course, a flaw with that is you don't want someone to use ws: to connect to your wss: service

[02:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm pretty sure you could

[02:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
adding TLS as a requirement is several orders of magnitude more complexity

[02:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm honestly not sure i could use websocket with freepascal for example, if TLS was required

[02:37:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I haven't studied libraries for other languages enough, but it's clear that in Python using TLS is not a great burden

[02:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
freepascal is so far on the long tail of implementation languages that I don't really care if it is easy to use to code a server from scratch

[02:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
anyone using it has already chosen to make their life hard

[02:39:00.0000] <gregw>
othermaciej:  I think general TLS libraries are pretty easy to use (a bit more complex on server side).  But most are lazy with memory and will lower the barrier to when fancy scalable solutions are needed

[02:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
also: a "hobbyist" should never under any circumstances implement a network service in a language with raw memory access

[02:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
well given that i've written a websocket server in freepascal already, i think it's relevant :-)

[02:39:03.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe relevant to you personally

[02:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
well yes

[02:39:05.0000] <othermaciej>
but I think the number of other people in the world who would care is in the single digits

[02:39:06.0000] <annevk>
Can you deploy the Python TLS on e.g. DreamHost without having to buy things like static IP and certificate nonsense?

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd probably have to write a binding to the openssl C library

[02:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
which sounds like a minor circle of hell

[02:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think you need a static IP, and I don't think you have to pay for a cert under Adam's proposal

[02:40:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: frankly, the freepascal argument feels a lot like the using Delphi as a reason to make the DOM suck more in the old days

[02:40:04.0000] <othermaciej>
gee, obscure language doesn't have good availability of libraries? I'm shocked

[02:40:05.0000] <hsivonen>
s/the/

[02:40:06.0000] <hsivonen>
s/the//

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: how would delphi make the DOM suck more?

[02:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: inability to represent null strings, IIRC

[02:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: I'm curious how much the memory hit is - that seems like useful data

[02:41:03.0000] <hsivonen>
or something of that nature

[02:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: delphi can represent null strings fine

[02:41:05.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, ok, if it works in DreamHost with e.g. Python or Perl and is relatively straightforward I'm good...

[02:41:06.0000] <othermaciej>
if the argument is hobbyists who would implement a network protocol themselves, then any language with raw pointers is a red herring

[02:41:07.0000] <gregw>
with java it is currently 128k extra per connection

[02:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's a feature if a hobbyist can't figure out how to use such a language to make a network service

[02:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm not arguing that hobbyists would use freepascal, i'm arguing that i have used freepascal

[02:42:02.0000] <gregw>
you can be smart and avoid this, but it is a major "circle of hell" to do so

[02:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: and i personally would find it a pain if we had to use tls

[02:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: in generaly though, not specifically for my own concerns, i think it's a bit weird to require something as complicated as TLS for a simple protocol

[02:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2005OctDec/0019.html

[02:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: much though I love you, I am not sure I can justify implementing an alternate WebSocket handshake solely for your personal convenience

[02:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that poster is mistaken

[02:43:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok

[02:43:04.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: 128k per connection is not so good

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: (you can just use a pointer to a string if that's what you want)

[02:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: that would be, like, a gig of memory for 8096 connections

[02:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: is that really right? that seems totally unworkable

[02:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
excuse me, 8192

[02:45:01.0000] <gregw>
the java SSLSession tells you how big your buffers should be and currently reports 64k for in and out.

[02:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: my own personal convenience isn't why i'm arguing against it

[02:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it's just a minor side-comment

[02:45:04.0000] <othermaciej>
ok

[02:45:05.0000] <gregw>
it might be able to be reduced... but not obvious how

[02:45:06.0000] <gregw>
the solution is to not allocate buffers to connections - but is very complex to do

[02:46:00.0000] <gregw>
we will be doing this anyway, just for HTTP

[02:46:01.0000] <gregw>
but it's not something trivial

[02:46:02.0000] <gregw>
it will push more medium sized servers to complex solutions

[02:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to find out how to do TLS from Perl

[02:47:00.0000] <gregw>
but there are many servers that will never have more than 100 connections.

[02:47:01.0000] <gregw>
but even that is a lot of memory for buffers

[02:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
does the canonical way to do a non-TLS socket in Java allocate such large buffers?

[02:47:03.0000] <gregw>
I'm 95% sure... I'll go check the source.... back in a bit

[02:47:04.0000] <othermaciej>
what are the buffers for?

[02:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know enough Java to do an experiment of measuring the actual memory increase

[02:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to work out from http://search.cpan.org/~sullr/IO-Socket-SSL-1.33/SSL.pm how to say what the next protocol is

[02:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i should clarify that if i wasn't worried about amateurs, i'd have never even suggested a non-encrypted version of the protocol

[02:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
obviously encrypting the connection is a huge win in many respects

[02:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i honestly can't see your average author understanding SSL, even if it's through a library

[02:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think you need to understand SSL to use it through a (simple enough) library any more than you need to understand TCP to use sockets

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's a lot more complexity in SSL than in TCP

[02:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
internally, yes

[02:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
exposed to a relatively simple user of the protocol via a library, only a little more, I think

[02:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
again, I am struck by the Twisted example

[02:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
externally too! look at the definition of the Perl IO::Socket::SSL API: http://search.cpan.org/~sullr/IO-Socket-SSL-1.33/SSL.pm#The_Long_of_It_%28Detail%29

[02:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I did not expect it to be so simple

[02:52:03.0000] <gregw>
othermaciej:  the buffers are for separating unecrypted data from encrypted data. The TLS protocol takes discrete chunks of data so that at any given time you can have unconsumed raw data and unflushed encrypted data 

[02:52:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: is that significantly more complicated than this: http://linux.die.net/man/2/connect

[02:53:00.0000] <gregw>
plus you need buffers for TLS to do it's own control frames

[02:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yes?

[02:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
either the Perl IO::Socket::SSL API or connect(2) are interfaces you would really want to use through a higer-level wrapper

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: IO::Socket::SSL _is_ the higher-level wrapper

[02:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: the next higher level is just a Web Socket library

[02:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it's not a very good wrapper compared to Twisted

[02:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: that's as may be

[02:55:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Twisted is higher level but still generic to any kind of network protocol you want to build

[02:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: though to be honest i haven't been able to find how to tell twisted to declare the next level protocol either

[02:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i don't think we should be relying on libraries to make this implementable any more than we should rely on tools to make html authorable

[02:55:06.0000] <gregw>
othermaciej:  initial TLS usage can be simple, but it quickly escalates into key stores and trust stores and certificate chains etc

[02:55:07.0000] <Hixie>
"the tools will save us" imho is not a valid argument in either case

[02:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I suspect since next_protocol_negotiation is pretty new it hasn't filtered into all the libraries yet

[02:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
connect() or gethostbyaddr() are just as much tools as TLS is

[02:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
i disagree

[02:56:03.0000] <othermaciej>
you think unix system calls don't count as an API you have to learn?

[02:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think unix system calls are the equivalent of "bare metal" compared to third-party libraries

[02:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not like socket() + listen() + accept() is an intuitive set of calls that everyone will figure out instantly

[02:58:01.0000] <annevk>
is a second handshake really that complicated though?

[02:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the fact that they come with the operating system does not free a developer from the burden of understanding them

[02:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
making it robust against cross-protocol attacks is complicated

[02:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but it can be simpler than it is now if it doesn't have to work over port 80 or on any port shared with an HTTP server

[03:00:00.0000] <annevk>
in the end it's just a bit of parsing, calculating, and writing something back

[03:00:01.0000] <annevk>
seems trivial compared to e.g. layout :)

[03:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
sure, but I wouldn't add a second layout engine either...

[03:06:00.0000] <gregw>
othermaciej:  I can't find the source in openJDK that handles the crypto buffers - will download full source later and look again.  But I am 95% sure it uses the same mechanism underneath and thus would have the same buffer sizes.

[03:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gregw: what I'm really curious about is the comparitive memory overhead of a normal (non-SSL) socket and what exactly the large buffers are for

[03:08:00.0000] <gregw>
othermaciej:  OK, I'll find out the exact numbers over the weekend.

[03:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I see that the Qt port now has MathML support.. is there porting/platform work that yet needs to be done to enable MathML in Safari?

[03:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: not as far as I know

[03:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
does it work in nightlies?

[03:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
/me can't remember if anyone enabled it by default

[03:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
didn't work in nightlies, not last time I checked

[03:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I'll try it again now

[03:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, I was confused

[03:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
was testing with http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/html5-hacks-demo.html but of course that's not going to work yet in WebKit

[03:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
because it requires MathML-in-text/html support

[03:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, still doesn't seem to be working though, even for tests served as XML

[03:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it might not be turned on yet

[03:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there is a build flag

[03:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[03:19:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, you look surprisingly weird without the stache :p

[03:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: yeh, I'm regretting it already

[03:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I was in need of a new look, anyway

[03:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm like Madonna that way

[03:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
need to keep my fans from getting bored

[03:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
man, my inbox situation is just out of hand

[03:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the world should do something about that for me

[03:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
we really need something like a Worldwide Day of No E-mail

[03:26:01.0000] <annevk>
can't quite place the new look; you went from Texas Ranger to something 70s I think

[03:26:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
It's a temporary state while I transform into my next manifestation of the Buddha

[03:27:00.0000] <annevk>
Buddha is a worthy goal

[03:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Bodhisattva

[03:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but the bodhisattva look is basically androgynous

[03:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I guess I'm too old to attempt that

[03:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it is appealing though

[03:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., http://www.tibetanart.us/art/bodhisattva.jpg

[03:30:02.0000] <annevk>
it seems you might need a stache for that: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Siddhartha.jpg

[03:30:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
excellent

[03:30:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
we're making progress

[03:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Bodhisattva with a beer gut

[03:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I could probably pull that one off

[03:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me gets to the point in webkit-dev archive where "Turning on MathML by Default?" thread took place

[03:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
thread seems to have died without resolution

[03:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I need a new look too

[03:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe othermaciej could chime in on it

[03:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe I should grow a moustache

[03:34:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I think I saw a picture of you a while back where you had bleached-blonde hair

[03:34:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
or highlighted or something at least

[03:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: if you grow a mustache, I'll grow mine back to

[03:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
*too

[03:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I have had long black hair, short bleached hair, short hair with high-contrast highlights, red hair...

[03:35:03.0000] <annevk>
searching on G for moustache yields: http://to55er.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/moustache-2.jpg

[03:35:04.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: the problem is when I try to grow one it ooks like a sleazy porno-stache

[03:35:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: that's the goal

[03:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's pretty much how mine looked

[03:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's the pinnacle of mustache looks

[03:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
not everybody can do the pornstache

[03:36:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: that dude's like Yosemite Sam with a bad creative consultant

[03:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool to see possible implementation work on context menus starting

[03:41:00.0000] <annevk>
in webkit?

[03:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[03:42:01.0000] <volkmar>
annevk: for the form attribute email, i'm not wondering if i have to follow line by line what is described but why the description look much more like implementations details

[03:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>

message from Drew Wilson at Google

[03:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wonder how practical it might be to try to put together a graph of some kind to track browser implementation status for HTML5 features 

[03:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: btw, did you make any progress on getting the splitter to generate files per-H3 or whatever? (to make the filenames in URLs more relevant)

[03:46:01.0000] <annevk>
volkmar, the requirements seem relevant to me, but okay

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, yeah, need surprisingly few changes

[03:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, great

[03:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
what's the URL again?

[03:47:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
for the multipage complete spec

[03:47:04.0000] <annevk>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/ or http://html5.org/complete/

[03:47:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks

[03:47:06.0000] <annevk>
do you want to know how to modify spec-splitter.py?

[03:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, this is great

[03:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: yeah, I would like to have the W3C version do the same

[03:50:00.0000] <annevk>
so in the functions should_split(e) and get_heading_text_and_id(e)

[03:50:01.0000] <annevk>
you want to replace the lines that start with if e.tag == 'div' simply with if e.tag == 'div':

[03:51:00.0000] <annevk>
so that it no longer does the and operator

[03:51:01.0000] <annevk>
then you modify split_exceptions with all the additional splits you want to make

[03:52:00.0000] <annevk>
i'll put my copy somewhere

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
http://html5.org/temp/2010/spec-splitter.txt

[03:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: thanks

[03:54:00.0000] <annevk>
(but that's all the changes I made iirc)

[03:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to hack the w3c splitter copy

[03:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: hmm, I also see differences in the value of split_exceptions

[03:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
did you change that too?

[03:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe my copy is older than what you started with from upstream

[03:56:03.0000] <annevk>
yeah, I added exceptions

[03:56:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK

[03:57:00.0000] <annevk>
to make splits for websockets et al better

[03:57:01.0000] <annevk>
since you don't have complete you might not need all of them

[03:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hai

[04:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: thanks -- I think it worked

[04:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/

[04:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should update the copy in the html5 project SVN if there's changes that ought to be used everywhere

[04:18:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess removing the check whether the div has a class of impl in the two functions should be changed everywhere as it breaks certain functionality of split_exceptions

[04:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which part of http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#association-of-controls-and-forms is about nested forms?

[04:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me is looking at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-bugzilla/2010May/0342.html

[04:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah cool -- <progress> actually works in Chrome and Safari now

[04:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess that's probably old new.. I reckon I'm close to a month or more behind on things

[04:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
*news

[04:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
does anybody have a demo page for <progress> ?

[04:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmith: Nested forms are removed in the parser

[04:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: I see

[04:52:01.0000] <Dashiva>
<form> a <form> b </form> c </form> becomes <form> a b </form> c

[04:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[04:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I guess the bug commenter wants that to be made more explicit

[04:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or something

[04:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me finds http://trac.webkit.org/export/59461/trunk/LayoutTests/fast/dom/HTMLProgressElement/progress-element.html

[04:58:00.0000] <Dashiva>
MikeSmith: I guess, although the form element does specify content model: no form children

[04:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[04:58:02.0000] <annevk>
via reader recommended: http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/c33my/on_their_way_to_getting_married_a_young_couple_is/ lol

[05:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Which part of the spec covers handling this in a Web-compatible way: https://bug565432.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=445028 ?

[05:31:00.0000] <annevk>
what is the bug hsivonen? URL parsing?

[05:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: failure to remove leading whitespace in the ftp case

[05:32:00.0000] <annevk>
I believe leading and trailing whitespace is to be trimmed for all URLs

[05:32:01.0000] <annevk>
though not by the HTML parser, of course

[05:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: is this in a spec that got moved to the IETF to die?

[05:34:00.0000] <annevk>
right

[05:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is a bit annoyed at failing to find an algorithm by following hyperlinks in the HTML5 spec

[05:34:02.0000] <annevk>
blame LM

[05:34:03.0000] <Dashiva>
"The href attribute on a and area elements must have a value that is a valid URL potentially surrounded by spaces. This URL is the destination resource of the hyperlink."

[05:34:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Doesn't that cover it?

[05:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
or is that just author conformance, maybe

[05:35:01.0000] <annevk>
he thought it would better if HTML5 didn't reference the old splitted out thing from DanC anymore

[05:35:02.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, that's authoring conformance

[05:35:03.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, you want the part about resolving which reference parsing, etc.

[05:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, right. That split.

[05:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, this is odd. by code inspection, Gecko seems to do the same thing for both http: and ftp: already...

[07:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Larry Masinter's response on http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/issue-90-objection-poll/results is interesting

[07:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
"Without a clear, acceptable transition plan, the risk is to fragment the web, and to encourage authors to create "best viewed by HTML5" web sites, in a repeat of Browser Wars 1.0."

[07:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Interesting... as in demonstrating he isn't even trying to understand?

[07:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow. Clearly, he isn't aware of all the effort that went into figuring out how to make these new elements degrade in older browsers

[07:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
especially in IE, and the base html5 CSS that a few people have made to give sensible defaults

[16:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wonder if anyone can come up with a response to this guy's signature: http://mobile.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1652454&cid=32208264

[16:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems like it would be pretty easy to do that in HTML5 if you had the original assets.

[16:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I mean, like actually porting Badger Badger to HTML5)

[16:05:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . Probably not worth the effort.

[16:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't see a signature on that post

[16:07:01.0000] <mbrubeck>
I had to log in and turn off "Disable sigs"

[16:07:02.0000] <mbrubeck>
it's "Want to replace Flash with HTML5? First try porting Badgers."

[16:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
At some point I'm sure someone will make a scene library of sorts to emulate basic flash animations

[16:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
With a link: http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com/

[16:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm surprised Slashdot signatures are disabled by default.  The length limit means that they're by far the best signatures I've seen on any website.

[16:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
People only have room for a tiny bit of info, so they make it pithy or informative.

[16:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
One of my favorites goes something like: "I would have made this post shorter, but I didn't have the time."

[16:09:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Pssh, I'm on a forum with max 15 characters :P


2010-05-15
[17:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
porting Badgers should be easy

[17:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
given the source assets anyway

[17:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, if I recall Badgers is just a bunch of translations and scalings.

[17:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Can you get good audio/graphics synchronisation?

[17:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Not needed, since the original badgers desyncs

[17:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[17:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me hasn't watched it enough to remember noticing that

[18:29:00.0000] <KaOSoFt>
<input> elements don't have "class" or "id" attribute? Just "name"?

[18:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
All elements have class and id attributes

[18:29:02.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Nevermind... just read the "Global attributes"

[18:29:03.0000] <KaOSoFt>
._.

[18:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: You have a corpus of pages to run regexps over, right?

[18:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Yes

[18:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
I have http://www.dotnetdotcom.org/

[18:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, dotbot is you?  Cool.

[18:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, do you index CSS files?

[18:43:01.0000] <Philip`>
No, it's not me

[18:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
I just downloaded their index sample

[18:43:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, kk.

[18:43:04.0000] <Philip`>
(which is on that page)

[18:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk.

[18:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, while I may go download that myself, for now, do you know if CSS files are indexed in that?

[18:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
(There's no CSS files in it)

[18:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
It's almost entirely text/html

[18:44:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dammit.

[18:44:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk.

[18:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's lots of inline <style>s, though

[18:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Actually, that'd probably still be fine.

[18:45:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
You mind running /#[0-9a-f]{4}[^0-9a-f]|#[0-9a-f]{8}[^0-9a-f]/ over it?

[18:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's not limited to <style>s, so it finds zillions of unhelpful matches

[18:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
For that string?

[18:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
like URL fragments, and numeric character references

[18:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.

[18:47:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, I've got something else running that should hopefully cough up results over the weekend.

[18:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I assume you wanted it to be a case-insensitive regexp)

[18:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yus.

[18:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Even the {8} one just finds <!-- webmoney attestation label#5F42F595-4775-4728-9FD2-E06986259B01 --> and <li><a href="forum/post-272136-cat-1-pg-910.html#f2290890" class="selected" title="KLIKNIJCIE">KLIKNIJCIE</a></li> etc

[18:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bleh, that's useless.  Kk.

[18:51:00.0000] <Philip`>

Can you run it for color and background-color?

[18:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Can do

[18:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Awesome.

[18:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
(color: will match background-color: too)

[18:53:03.0000] <Philip`>
Remind me to upload the results in ten minutes

[19:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Those damned swingers, with their giant lines that I can't find the matched bits in.

[01:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
#abcdef/0.5

[01:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me thinks opacity should stay as [0,1] since people have gotten used to it by now

[01:47:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
#abc/0.5

[01:48:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
what about color keywords combined with opacity?

[01:48:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
papayawhip/0.5

[01:48:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
would be nice

[01:50:00.0000] <annevk>
rgb()/

[01:50:01.0000] <annevk>
rgba()/ ...

[01:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i wouldn't apply it to rgb() or rgba() notations

[01:57:00.0000] <ment>
isn't "/" already used as operator?

[01:57:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
where?

[01:58:00.0000] <ment>
in css2.1

[01:58:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
which property?

[01:58:02.0000] <ment>
not property, grammar

[01:59:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
 / is not special in the grammar, i think

[01:59:01.0000] <ment>
operator: '/' S* | ',' S*;

[01:59:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
ah

[01:59:03.0000] <ment>
i know you have another layer of property-syntax parser atop of grammar-parser, but still

[01:59:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
still, it's not a problem, is it?

[02:01:00.0000] <ment>
if you don't mind ending with c++-like parser in ten years, then no, it isn't

[02:06:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i wouldn't want to use an uglier character because the grammar splits it

[02:06:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
we use operators in rgba() too

[02:10:00.0000] <ment>
hmm that's true

[02:11:00.0000] <annevk>
border-radius uses / too

[02:11:01.0000] <annevk>
font too

[02:11:02.0000] <annevk>
background level 3 too

[02:12:00.0000] <annevk>
not very special

[02:13:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe the tradition so far is to use / in shorthand properties to split values of two property values

[02:13:01.0000] <ment>
but this would have to be parsed in the lexer

[02:15:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, not in border-radius

[02:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: about.validator.nu doesn't talk about html5+aria+svg+mathml

[02:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
www.Adobe.com/Choice/ is a sponsored link at the top of the google search result for 'html5'

[02:45:00.0000] <annevk>
lowercase C?

[02:45:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm, uppercase C, but if you would type that in you get an error

[02:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
interesting

[06:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh neat, someone finally asked what content-language is supposed to be useful for

[11:12:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it seems srt doens't have comments like websrt does

[11:12:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
what happens in srt impl when there are websrt comments?

[11:15:00.0000] <annevk>
websrt comments?

[11:15:01.0000] <micheil>
websrt?

[11:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
comments?

[11:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
the spec doesn't have comments apparently but http://damowmow.com/temp/srtspec does

[11:17:00.0000] <annevk>
copy-paste from text/event-source?

[11:18:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm doesn't seem like it

[11:28:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: validator.nu seems to have code to warn when a meta is sniffed as an encoding decl but there's no http-equiv='content-type'

[11:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: maybe that could be used to find pages that have such meta elements

[11:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Philip`: for the purpose of researching the compat impact of http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9225

[11:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is probably too busy/lazy to do any research like that any time soon

[11:34:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[13:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: i gave up trying to add comments

[13:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: good :)

[13:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://www.chromium.org/sts seems useful

[13:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it really needs to be spec'd properly

[13:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I also hate the "includeSubdomains" option

[13:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
trying to get STS into a standards body seems to be kind of stalled out :-(

[13:50:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it doesn't help the first time you visit the site, unless the site is listed in the preloaded list

[13:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe we don't need a header at all, just the preloaded list combined with smarter default (if server redirects to https, assume it wants https in the future also)

[13:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the most important feature of STS (IMO) is not https-always but rather forcing hard rejection of self-signed or otherwise invalid certs

[13:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be nice to do that for all certs but doing it on an opt-in basis seems like a good starting point

[13:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
STS isn't meant to help you the first time you visit a site, it's meant to help you if you have a pre-existing relationship with the site and want to access it under untrusted network conditions

[14:01:00.0000] <annevk>
wasn't there a more formal IETF draft of STS?

[14:02:00.0000] <annevk>
nm

[14:04:00.0000] <theMadness>
I'm apalled at www-style, :selection gets a lengthy discussion while there's still no fallback mechanism other than the media query thing webkit implemented for SOME things.

[02:27:00.0000] <annevk>
wow

[02:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm surprised dbaron didn't enter "other comments"

[02:29:00.0000] <annevk>
with interest like this, there's no need to make a point

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think that pretty much sums it up

[02:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I bet it still goes to REC

[02:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
duh

[02:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
if it didn't go to rec that would mean the w3c followed w3c process

[02:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would love to see the implementation report they used to exit CR

[02:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
are there any implementation criteria to meet?

[02:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: seen the XLink 1.1 impl report?

[02:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder what their exit criteria are

[02:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder why they aren't cited in the AC survey

[02:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there isn't even a link to the spec in the survey

[02:33:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, is it public?

[02:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
secret

[02:33:03.0000] <annevk>
XLink is such a joke

[02:34:00.0000] <annevk>
it's extremely unfortunate it went into SVG

[02:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.w3.org/XML/2006/01/xlink11-implementation

[02:34:02.0000] <annevk>
and MathML too, maybe?

[02:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
isn't that it?

[02:34:04.0000] <annevk>
that's public

[02:34:05.0000] <othermaciej>
that doesn't appear to be Member-only

[02:34:06.0000] <othermaciej>
that's what the REC in TR links to

[02:34:07.0000] <annevk>
such a joke

[02:35:00.0000] <annevk>
SVG implementations only support XLink to the extent that they need to recognize certain attributes of XLink on certain elements

[02:36:00.0000] <annevk>
I believe according to the XLink guys that is valid usage of XLink...

[02:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if I should waste Dave Singer's time by asking him to vote no on any PR survey that doesn't cite the CR exit criteria and implementation report

[02:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
apparently only specs that reality impiges on have to follow w3c process

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk>
why impose requirements on lalaland?

[02:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I usually tell him not to respond at all on stuff we don't care about

[02:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
the level of double standard at the w3c is so astronomical it makes a joke of the whole thing

[02:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
svg 1.2 tiny being my favourite example

[02:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to be fair, getting html5 right is orders of magnitude more important than getting xlink 1.1 right

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
if the w3c staff admitted that and justified ignoring process on the "unimportant" specs because of that, then i wouldn't feel like that was actually just a coincidence

[02:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think no one is fussy about process until people complain, generally

[02:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
otoh with svg 1.2 there were lots of complaints

[02:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so that's the one that seems like an outlier

[02:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
i'm ptretty sure the xlink 1.1 iml report used to be secret

[02:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the xlink 1.1 CR exit criteria did include "There are at least two interoperable implementations of the specification."

[02:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
of every feature?

[02:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the implementation report doesn't seem to give any evidence for that assertion

[02:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
is there a test suite? i'd love to learn how xlink is supposed to actually work

[02:46:04.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.w3.org/XML/2006/03/xlink11-tests

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
in what sense is that a test suite?

[02:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in the sense that it was linked from the implementation report in the section with a header of "Test Suite"

[02:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me points back to his comment about the process being a joke half the time

[02:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am having a hard time running those tests in my browser because they are served with a Content-type of "charset=utf-8"[sic]

[02:52:00.0000] <annevk>
also uses external entity references

[02:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if I load one by hand after downloading I get a blank page - not sure if that is a pass or fail

[03:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so, the last version of XHTML Modularization 1.1 to link to an implementation report linked to this: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2006/m12n-11-implementation.html

[03:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the PER doesn't have a link to an impleentation report at all

http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2010/04/12/ignoring-parentheses.aspx#comments <-- i guess microsoft really _doesn't_ care about interop with their .NET framework afterall, who knew

[03:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
*feigned surprise*

[03:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
seems like an issue with the C# language, not the .NET framework

[03:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[03:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
C# is part of .NET

[03:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, I'm not that surprised that they ruled out changing the compiler, but I am surprised that they ruled out changing the spec

[03:58:00.0000] <annevk>
/me is interested in why Hixie was reading that :)

[03:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
it was about 4 links out from a reddit comment

[03:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just browsing the web :-)

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk>

Firefox seems to have gaps between every line when you select text - has it always done that?

[06:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
/me ca't beliee he never noticed

[06:42:02.0000] <variable>
othermaciej: I don't see that on my copy

[06:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm testing in Firefox 3.6.3 on a Mac

[06:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
example site: http://slashdot.org/

[06:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if my selection spans multiple lines, I see gaps w/o the selection color between the lines

[06:47:00.0000] <variable>
othermaciej: http://isis.poly.edu/~eitan/files/scrshot-no-spanbreak.jpg

[06:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder what is wrong with my copy

[06:48:01.0000] <variable>
othermaciej: I just tested on /.

[06:48:02.0000] <variable>
same issue

[06:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
by "same issue" do you mean that you do see gaps, or that you don't?

[06:50:00.0000] <variable>
othermaciej: I see the gaps on /.   

[06:50:01.0000] <variable>
but I don't see them on the webchat for freenode

[06:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
very weird

[06:50:03.0000] <variable>
and I see them on half the lines in the The connection has timed out page on firefox

[06:50:04.0000] <variable>
(if it breaks <p> I think I see the gaps else I don't>

[06:50:05.0000] <variable>
s/t>/)//

[06:51:00.0000] <variable>
/me makes testcase now

[06:53:00.0000] <variable>
othermaciej: got it: there is a gap if it breaks <p> or multiple <br>s but not one <br> or no <p>

[06:53:01.0000] <variable>
there was a thread about this on www-style recently. IIRC IE attempts to only select text along with FF but opera attempts to select elements as well (not sure what that means re gaps)

[06:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
slashdot doesn't seem to have multiple <br>s or <p>s in the article summaries

[06:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, I know they won't select gaps between paragraphs, but I see gaps between lines in a single paragraph

[06:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
which I was not expecting

[06:55:02.0000] <variable>
odd. Report a bug to FF?

[11:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/db/index.html - "based on the ubiquitous SQLite version 3 API, Berkeley DB provides a drop-in compatible SQL database library and command line tool"

[11:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if that's compatible enough for web browser use

[11:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, apparently it's basically the SQLite frontend with the storage implementation rewritten to use BDB, or something along those lines

[11:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it's probably compatible but not really independent

[13:10:00.0000] <annevk>
isn't the Firefox selection related to line boxes and line-height and all? seems more logical than it being related to <br> and what not

[13:24:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, whatwg.org is down

[14:10:00.0000] <annevk>

If anyone’s around, I have a question about <nav> and breadcrumbs. I don’t think they’re suitable for <nav>, but some people seem to. Is this an “up to the author” case?

[19:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: would you want them skipped for AT users?

[19:17:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: I think so, but not being an AT user I’m not sure if that’s personal bias

[19:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's usually the criteria i use for deciding on <nav>

[19:18:00.0000] <boblet>
also I assumed this would be taken care of by link’s @rel

[19:19:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: so not a case of wrong, more an ‘up to the author’ thing eh

[19:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
boblet: well it's never wrong _not_ to use <nav>

[19:38:00.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: just more or less suitable huh

[19:38:01.0000] <boblet>
thanks, that’s a good point to keep in mind

[20:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
would you want to skip it when reading the content, but possibly skip *to* it if you want to find navigation landmarks

[20:10:00.0000] <boblet>
othermaciej: yeah, I think so. would that be covered by not using nav, and adding @rel="up" as per links.html#link-type-up ?

[20:10:01.0000] <boblet>
I’m not sure how AT exposes navigation landmarks

[20:11:00.0000] <boblet>
(and am assuming that @rel = said landmarks)

[23:10:00.0000] <Aleoss>
Can someone explain the purpose of the <keygen> element?

[23:28:00.0000] <Aleoss>
Anyone?

[23:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Aleoss: digital signatures

[23:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for cases in the brick-and-mortar world where you would need to sign a document before you submit it

[23:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., for a bank or government form or whatever

[23:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
keygen generates a public/private keypair

[23:38:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and submits the public key along with the document

[23:38:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's my understanding of it at least

[23:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which take with a grain of salt because I've not actually implemented it nor even tested it

[23:39:01.0000] <Aleoss>
MikeSmith: Ok. So a private key is created on the client side and a public key is sent to the server and what can the server do with this key? Just keep it linked to that post data? What's different than having it in a session?

[23:39:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
it persists, I guess

[23:39:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
so it can be checked again later

[23:40:00.0000] <Aleoss>
MikeSmith: Sessions and client-side cookies can be checked later, that's the purpose of them.

[23:41:00.0000] <Aleoss>
MikeSmith: So what you're suggesting is that it is just re-inventing the wheel.

[23:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so don't use it if you don't need it

[23:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the reason it's implemented in browsers is that there are sites that use it

[23:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
browsers did not implement it because they like it

[23:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least other browsers did not

[23:42:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Netscape did initiallly

[23:43:00.0000] <doublec>
Aleoss, more details here http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/tagpages/k/keygen.htm

[23:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I think the difference from cookies is pretty obvious

[23:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
doublec: roc not around today?

[23:44:01.0000] <Aleoss>
So it's used for HTTPS only?

[23:44:02.0000] <doublec>
MikeSmith, he just left the office about 10minutes ago

[23:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

I don't know what particular features any of those tests are actually exercising

[00:09:02.0000] <roc>
interesting

[00:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, it does at least show the level of support in Flash vs. level of support in Silverlight

[00:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and who knew TTML had "animation" support?

[00:10:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm not sure I even want to know what exactly that is

benschwarz: "The reading experience is far from delightful".. you certainly won't get any arguments from anybody about that :)

[00:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the only thing worse than reading specs is writing them

[00:27:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
only crazy people like writing specs

[00:27:03.0000] <benschwarz>
MikeSmith: pretty easy argument to "win" 

[00:27:04.0000] <gsnedders>
I make a point to avoid anyone who writes specs

[00:28:00.0000] <benschwarz>

somebody linked to them from twitter, iirc

[00:30:01.0000] <benschwarz>
MikeSmith: awesome dude. what did you think? 

[00:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I like the part about "fancy borders"

[00:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it makes a point

[00:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I loved that "Are we fucked" slide quite a bit too

[00:31:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think I may steal that idea

[00:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll probably get complaints about it

[00:35:00.0000] <benschwarz>
Which whatwg email list should I post my article to? 

[00:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
whatwg, me thinks

[00:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
benschwarz: whatwg⊙wo it is, I think

[00:36:02.0000] <benschwarz>
no worries. 

[00:37:00.0000] <benschwarz>
we wanted to offer the whatwg group to use some custom styles to improve the reading experience

[00:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
benschwarz: http://www.germanforblack.com/css-fonts-demo/index.html certainly does look better than the default style

[00:40:00.0000] <benschwarz>
If you use the userscript, you can have it always :) 

[00:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe we can add a link on each spec, "View this document in a style that's actually optimized for reading"

[00:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders about WCAG2 Compliance

[02:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, that's disappointing

(this is also disappointing: "Error during validation: java.net.UnknownHostException: relaxed2.vse.cz" ... that seems to be the message you get when you actually try to validate a page using the Relaxed validator...)

[02:12:02.0000] <annevk>
filtering out text nodes

[02:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I can't believe they haven't fixed that yet

[02:12:04.0000] <othermaciej>
makes it hard to use the "same markup"(tm)

[02:14:00.0000] <annevk>
heh yeah, I was thinking of blogging something like that but then I haven't actually tried IE9 yet so I'm not sure if the tests are actually representative (though I'd guess they only release stuff they pass, as they have done so far)

[02:15:00.0000] <annevk>
I would write a bunch of tests but I want someone to figure out the infrastructure first

[02:15:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me pokes TabAtkins 

[02:15:02.0000] <annevk>
I thought these Microsoft guys would handle that but so far I've just been reviewing lousy tests

[02:16:00.0000] <boblet>
baby steps, natch

[02:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe you should figure out the infrastructure

[02:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or at least enough of it to write the tests you want to write

[02:19:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm not good at designing a JS test framework :)

[02:19:01.0000] <boblet>
othermaciej: oh, re your comment “would you want to skip it when reading the content, but possibly skip *to* it if you want to find navigation landmarks” would this be accomplished by nav on breadcrumbs, or by no nav and role="up" on breadcrumb links instead?

[02:19:02.0000] <annevk>
(or picking one)

[02:19:03.0000] <boblet>
as that’s exactly what I think I’d like

[02:19:04.0000] <othermaciej>
boblet: you have many different choices of what elements to use

[02:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I guess we should find someone who is good at it

[02:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: what about non-script tests?

[02:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
like testing parsing

[02:20:03.0000] <othermaciej>
or should that be done in a script-driven way too?

[02:22:00.0000] <boblet>
in what situations do you all think nav for breadcrumbs is a good idea? (trying to work out if I’m missing a use case or not) I figure only if there is little other navigation and the breadcrumbs provide an important way to reach homepage and archive page parents that aren’t already offered

[02:23:00.0000] <annevk>
parsing we already did to some extent: http://html5.org/parsing-tests/testrunner.htm (not up to date with the latest tests)

[02:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not really a web design expert

[02:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
do you think breadcrumbs are part of the primary navigation aids on the page or part of the content?

[02:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: maybe it would be a good idea to contribute that infrustructure and set of tests to the test suite, if they haven't been already

[02:25:00.0000] <boblet>
othermaciej: for me, no. but I’m guessing for some people yes. I’m wondering if there’s AT-side (intended) usage I don’t know about

[02:27:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah so e.g. Firefox nightlies fail a bunch because the tests changed and I never took a fresh copy from html5lib

[02:28:00.0000] <boblet>
are long-form boolean attributes (pubdate="pubdate") required in XHTML5? or is this just a stylistic difference?

[02:28:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, yeah, the problem is that tests are currently maintained by the html5lib community; convincing everyone that our tests now live in a new repository and/or coordinating everything will the parser section stabilizes might not be our best use of time

[02:28:02.0000] <annevk>
boblet, you can write pubdate=""

[02:29:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: oh thanks, just re-read 2.4.2 and noticing that for the first time. I’m still not sure if there’s a reason for the three styles other than author pref tho

[02:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I think the odds of major parser changes are low, though I guess they are still nonzero

[02:32:00.0000] <annevk>
boblet, there's only two styles, pubdate="" and pubdate="pubdate" and the latter is for backwards compatibility

[02:32:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, guess we'll see when we resolve ISSUE-41 :p

[02:33:00.0000] <boblet>
facepalm

[02:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: fair enough - though I am not sure anyone has made a proposal that involves parser changes

[02:37:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: so “its value must either be the empty string” actually means “pubdate=""” and not “pubdate”? does that mean “pubdate” isn’t valid?

[02:37:01.0000] <annevk>
you're confusing syntax and semantics

[02:38:00.0000] <annevk>
<article pubdate> is a syntactic shorthand for <article pubdate="">

[02:38:01.0000] <annevk>
as <div title> is short for <div title="">

[02:38:02.0000] <boblet>
aah

[02:38:03.0000] <annevk>
nothing really special

[02:38:04.0000] <boblet>
the wording confused me

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk>
the difference becomes more obvious when you look at the DOM

[02:40:00.0000] <annevk>
in http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/syntax.html#attributes-0 you can read "Just the attribute name. The value is implicitly the empty string."

[02:41:00.0000] <boblet>
oh nice — haven’t read this before

[02:47:00.0000] <boblet>
aah, so pubdate becomes pubdate="" in the DOM. gotcha

[02:47:01.0000] <boblet>
thanks annevk 

[02:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
the problem with http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attributes is that it's stated in terms of the DOM

[02:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which is not the terms in which authors think of it

[02:48:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, it's like pubdate='' vs pubdate="" doesn't matter either for determining the value of the pubdate attribute

[02:48:02.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: filed a bug. will add a comment about that

[02:48:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I saw it

[02:48:04.0000] <boblet>
(my bug report was naive :)

[02:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the vast majority of authors are never going to make the leap that "its value must either be the empty string" applies to <article pubdate>

[02:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
they're not going to consider that attribute as having the empty string as its value

[02:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
they're instead going to just consider that as an attribute with no value

[02:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
because they naturally think in terms of the serialization

[02:51:02.0000] <annevk>
fortunately the vast majority of authors won't read the spec and therefore won't be confused

[02:52:00.0000] <annevk>
insofar lalaland isn't confusing

[02:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, well, the authors-won't-read-the-spec rationalization is not a particularly inspiring one

[02:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie added that "The value is implicitly the empty string." language because of an earlier bug I filed

[02:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
he just added it in the wrong place

[02:53:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
suboptimal place

[02:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
file more bugs :-)

[02:53:04.0000] <boblet>
Hixie: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9743

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[02:54:01.0000] <boblet>
annevk: oh noes! I broke it (by reading the spec) ;-)

[02:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
the quantum computing stuff is making my head spin

[02:54:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it actually relies on quantum entanglement

[02:54:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
which I still don't actually believe exists

[02:55:00.0000] <annevk>
boblet, you're not vast majority ;)

[02:56:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: sometimes I think life would be easier if I was :|

[02:56:01.0000] <boblet>
heh

[02:56:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I want to Einstein was right and this whole "spooky action at a distance" stuff is just a big hoax

[02:57:00.0000] <boblet>
l8r all, thanks for your help! learnin learnin’

[02:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmithX: einstein just claimed there are underlying hidden variables, rather than a mysterious correlation

[02:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmithX: there are hidden variables theories that explain entanglement, they just have to be nonlocal

[03:00:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
othermaciej: yeah, Rod van Meter here was telling me about the local variable stuff

[03:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Science would be much easier if we could just believe what Einstein said instead of having to do actual experiments

[03:00:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
heh

[03:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Bell's inequalities pretty much rule out Einstein's preferred view of local hidden variables

[03:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sorry

[03:01:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Rod mentioned Bell too

[03:01:03.0000] <othermaciej>
reality bites

[03:01:04.0000] <othermaciej>
logging off for a bit, brb

[03:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip` and Maciej seem to know about everything

[03:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's depressing

[03:02:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: please know about less stuff

[03:02:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
take some time off from learning now and then

[03:02:04.0000] <Hixie>
just keep a tab open on google and wikipedia

[03:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
you don't have to know everything, you just have to be one step ahead of everyone else

[03:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the Web takes all the fun out of everything

[03:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
beg to differ :-P

[03:03:03.0000] <Philip`>
Also, pretend to type very slowly so that nobody knows you've been checking the Wiki before every sentence you write

[03:03:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, the Jedi A-Holes video gives me hope for the Web

[03:13:00.0000] <annevk>
it requires Flash

[03:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: it's nice to have a goal to work towards

[03:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the goal being, make that video viewable natively cross-browser

[03:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
then we will have done something great for the world

[03:16:00.0000] <annevk>
one step closer to world peace

[03:16:01.0000] <annevk>
euh, world domination

[03:16:02.0000] <annevk>
I keep getting those mixed up

[03:16:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: <html><svg> is not error handling

[03:18:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i'd like microsoft to test and implement escaping out of foreign lands

[03:18:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, <html><svg></svg><body> is

[03:19:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
yes

[03:19:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, so I'm not sure why you're saying it's not testing error handling

[03:20:00.0000] <annevk>
oh I see, poor wording on my part

[03:20:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
just a nitpick :)

[03:21:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe i should file a bug at microsoft about foreign lands

[03:24:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
did Philip` have the results of running the html5lib tests in ie9 somewhere?

[03:27:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
does ie9 preview2 support <video>?

[03:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: http://philip.html5.org/misc/html5lib-runner-ie9.txt

[03:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
(from the first preview)

[03:35:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
thanks

[03:38:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, I thought they said they implemented an HTML5 parser

[03:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
any interop issues there for which we need updates to the spec?

[03:40:00.0000] <annevk>
dunno, <title> never has child nodes?

[03:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
nah, that's widely implemented correctly elsewhere

[03:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: I don't think they ever said that

[03:41:00.0000] <annevk>
your sarcasm sensors are off

[03:41:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
html5lib tests don't test <foobar/> outside foreign lands

[03:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me recalibrates

[03:50:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/559531/ie9-fails-html5lib-html-parser-tests

[03:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen's twitter just made me laugh

[03:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure I understand the test output

[03:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
of the html5lib tests

[03:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
Using which harness?

[03:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
if it doesn't say Failed, does that mean they all passed?

[03:53:04.0000] <othermaciej>
http://html5.org/parsing-tests/testrunner.htm

[03:53:05.0000] <jgraham>
/me is about 4 days behind on context

[03:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
neither Safari 4.0.5 nor Firefox 3.6.3 report any failures

[03:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and I know neither of those parsers is fully HTML5 compliant

[03:54:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
othermaciej: you need to click on the output to expand the results

[03:54:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[03:54:04.0000] <othermaciej>
would be handy if it gave a summary of the pass/fail count somewhere

[03:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh, are the numbers it reports the failing tests?

[03:55:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
yes

[03:55:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
the output sucks

[03:55:03.0000] <othermaciej>
we fail buckets o

[03:55:04.0000] <othermaciej>
buckets o' tests then

[03:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i don't know if http://gsnedders.html5.org/html5lib-tests/runner.html is more up to date

[03:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems to run a lot more tests

[03:57:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
yeah. the one on html5.org is old

[03:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
/me thinks these should be submitted to the HTML5 test suite

[03:57:02.0000] <annevk>
the gsnedders one doesn't work on Opera

[03:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
Ironically

[03:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
It will be improved

[03:58:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm wfm

[03:58:03.0000] <jgraham>
Erm, it won't be improved ironically

[03:58:04.0000] <annevk>
i mean i can't click on the result lines to see what failed

[03:58:05.0000] <jgraham>
it will be improved in an entirely irony-free way

[04:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
So, before I read the logs, has it already been noted that the ES people are discussing the WebGL typed array thing?

[04:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
So if that doesn't work for websockets use cases for some reason, now would be a good time to say

[04:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's the WebGL typed array thing?

[04:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/doc/spec/TypedArray-spec.html

[04:02:00.0000] <annevk>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-script-coord/2010AprJun/0008.html scared me about TypedArray

[04:02:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
i would just want a binary array, which i guess is Uint8Array

[04:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: Yeah, that concerns me too

[04:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
javascript already has 16-bit unsigned arrays

[04:04:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
called strings

[04:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
JS has immutable fixed-length 16-bit unsigned arrays

[04:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
with a weird syntax to access the elements

[04:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(str.charCodeAt(n) instead of str[n])

[04:05:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
str[n] works fine

[04:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: wouldn't it just use network byte order regardless of the underlying architecture?

[04:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems like that would solve the problem neatly

[04:06:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
although it just returns the character, true

[04:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, while it may be a bit more complicated than what i was expecting, it seems like it would do the job

[04:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
dunno if it's the best primitive to have though

[04:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think it'd be neater to have just a straight byte array with a mechanism like C structs to read structured data out of it, but *shrug*

[04:07:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
one of our carakan devs didn't like having lots of types of arrays

[04:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
but he could see the use case of a binary array

[04:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders who that was

[04:08:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
farre

[04:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a way to intercept DOMContentLoaded before normal listeners, do stuff and then dispatch it to normal listeners?

[04:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, is there a robust way to delay the load event?

[04:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
capturing DOMContentLoaded listener on the window

[04:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
i wonder if adding an iframe and calling open() onits contentDocument works

[04:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if you set the first one, I believe it is guaranteed to run before any other DOMContenLoaded listener

[04:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
do you mean delay the load event from inside DOMContentLoaded?

[04:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: thanks. 

[04:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: no, delaying it first and stopping the delaying from within the fake Domcontentloaded

[04:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what do you mean by fake DOMContentLoaded?

[04:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
load can't happen before DOMContentLoaded, so I assume you mean something other than delaying it to the point that DOMContentLoaded fires

[04:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
did you want to stop propagation and dispatch it later by hand?

[04:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I was thinking of doing async stuff from my domcontentloaded handler

[04:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so, yes, redispatching it later

[04:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: It should work

[04:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
wfm in 10.53 beta for linux

hmm

[04:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Random comment related to old email: extrapolating from "it's X lines of code for an echo server in Y" to "therefore Y is not complex" is extremely dangerous

[04:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
e.g. twisted is widely belived to be complex

[04:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
(to use well)

[04:25:00.0000] <micheil>
heh, only in node.js, that's actually true that it can be used well in a little amount of code ;P

[04:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: It may be, but that's very little to do with how many lines of code an echo server in node.js takes

[04:27:01.0000] <micheil>
true

[04:28:00.0000] <micheil>
/me has an echo websocket server in node using < 50 lines of code

[04:28:01.0000] <micheil>
(admittedly I'm using my own module for node to provide websockets :p)

[04:28:02.0000] <micheil>
it's currently draft75 compliant

[04:28:03.0000] <micheil>
working on draft76 after I iron out all the small bugs

[04:29:00.0000] <micheil>
and write tests

man i wish i understood gregw's e-mails

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish we had an URL parsing spec already.

[05:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
perhaps we need to trick abarth into editing it

[05:16:02.0000] <annevk>
he offered editing it

[05:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
true, I guess we could make it a separate document from the IRIbis draft

[05:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
let's let him finish his current docs first

[05:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'll eventually just write the url spec is the iri group don't get aroudn to it

[05:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
abarth has good test data

[05:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
percent escapes in the host name in http: URLs in Gecko don't work

[05:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
we converted most of google-url's test suite into a form that is easily runnable in any browser

[05:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
but the status bar makes it look like they work

[05:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(as you can see, supposed HTML parser bugs take me to various other areas of Gecko...)

[05:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you set <track>.src and the file starts downloading

[05:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
and you then dynamically change its .src to something else

[05:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
should it abort the download?

[05:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
or should it wait until the download is done before starting the new one?

[05:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it should act the same as any other element that references a resource if you change the relevant attribute

[05:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
which would be, abort and start new load

[05:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[05:23:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(unless I am missing a subtle reason that it should be different)

[05:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
no reason other than it being a pain in my neck

[05:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that's what i'm paid for

[05:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
first, though, i shall sleep

Is it appropriate to put zero bytes in html5lib tree builder tests?

[05:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
I believe html5lib always does the input stream processing, so zero bytes would turn into U+FFFD before reaching the tokeniser or tree builder

[05:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: as in U+0000?

[05:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Should be fine I think

[05:59:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: (or if not it's a bug)

[06:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: as in zero byte in the file and the zero byte should decode to U+0000

[06:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
The usability of Grub2 is so fantastically bad it's not even comical

[06:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
since Debian/Ubuntu installer is capable of automatically configuring Grub2, why on earth isn't that automation available outside the installation process?

[06:16:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: code bloat on grub2 is incredible too, hence I use http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/EXTLINUX

[06:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: I think I'm not adventurous enough to use a bootloader other than the one provided by the distro

[06:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but seriously, even Canonical's paid support is unable to give me a recipe for refreshing grub2 on a cloned disk to boot from the disk it was relocated to

[06:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
...after Canonical's paid support has had a couple of attempts at correcting its story

[06:20:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: Canonical's drives into complexity with upstart and grub2 will just land you in a world of pain. Try Archlinux :-)

[06:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
one would think that refreshing the bootloader on a hard drive were something right out of the support cases that are common enough to have scripted responses!

[06:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: I want a non-obscure distro with support available from the vendor

[06:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: as I understand it, the set of non-obscure distros is Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian and openSUSE

[06:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: and of those, only Ubuntu comes with support from the vendor

[06:21:03.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: who do you expect to support you when your browser falls over? Ubuntu?

[06:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: browser is different, since I compile the browser myself

[06:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
as I understand it, RedHat doesn't sell support for Fedora

[06:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
only to RHEL Desktop

[06:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and RHEL desktop is not one of the distros for which end user -oriented packages are made available

[06:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(my cheatsheet for figuring out which distros are non-obscure is looking at the download pages for Skype and Chrome)

[06:24:01.0000] <hendry>
how does Ubuntu's support work? You call them up? Or do you use that god forsaken Launchpad application?

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: I use a salesforce.com-backed app embedded in Landscape

[06:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
It's quite sad, really

[06:25:02.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: i really don't see the benefit for developers

[06:25:03.0000] <hendry>
linux is pretty straightforward imo

[06:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: which "developers"?

[06:26:01.0000] <hendry>
just took my about 5 years to figure it out mind

[06:26:02.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: people who know how to compile code and read a little shell and C :)

[06:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
It amazes me that the process of making a bootable backup is so hard

[06:26:04.0000] <hsivonen>
does everyone else do distupgrades without a bootable backup?

[06:27:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: er, yup

[06:27:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: i don't back up binaries

[06:27:02.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: most of my stuff is in git and in at least two locations, so I don't backup anything except photos/videos

[06:27:03.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: do you back up your package list and do you have a way to reinstall based on a list?

[06:28:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: i used to, but i don't bother nowadays. it takes me 10 minutes on a new install to get all the stuff I need.

[06:28:01.0000] <hendry>
dpkg set selections has never really worked for me either. somehow i've managed to screw things up when doing it that way.

[06:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how much money one needs to be able to do the "I have money but no time" thing with Linux

[06:29:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: enough to hire a good admin? :)

[06:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I paid the highest single-seat price for support, but it's obvious that it can't buy a lot of work

[06:29:03.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: companies like bytemark.co.uk or bitfolk offer really valuable support to me

[06:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: bytemark is servers only, right?

[06:30:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: yes

[06:31:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: they are fairly inexpensive compared to hiring someone

[06:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Canonical's support business model seems to be badly thought-out compared to RedHat

[06:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the pricing is roughly the same

[06:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but in the RedHat case, the customer pays before knowing (s)he needs support

[06:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so RedHat can pocket the money when the customer doesn't ask anything

[06:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in the Canonical case, the customer only buys support when (s)he has at least one question to ask

[06:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so Canonical never gets to pocket the money without having a support incident to respond to

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: btw, backups aren't only about upgrades. if my boot disk breaks, I want to have a fully configured and operational system available within half an hour or so preferably sooner

[06:36:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: PAYG is bad for business. Subscription is the only model that works IMO.

[06:37:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: if my disk breaks, i get a new server via linode, bytemark and start pushing my configs

[06:37:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: i guess it will take me a whole day to get back working. I could do it faster if I had more practice.

[06:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: you don't run dev tools locally?

[06:38:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: oh you are talking about a workstation?

[06:38:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: same deal I guess

[06:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: yes, I'm talking about the computer I run Eclipse on

[06:39:00.0000] <smaug___>
volkmar: does Bug 556743 require some other patch to build?

[06:39:01.0000] <smaug___>
er, wrong channel

[06:39:02.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: in my workstation I have a huge disk I rsync to when I can remember to. if my main disk failed I guess I could get up and running on it, in an hour.

[06:41:00.0000] <hendry>
if i haven't rsynced for a long time, dist-upgrade and git pulls will get me back being productive I hope

[06:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: do you mean booting from that disk or reinstalling the system and then rsyncing bits back?

[06:42:00.0000] <hendry>
if my main disk failed, I would just boot from the "huge disk". maybe we should go private btw?

[09:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: BTW re: test infrastructure, I am having a bash at something simple for discussion

[09:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
Dunno if it is very good or not

[09:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me started playing around with stuff for it a while ago too

[09:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I learnt a lot of things not to do from that, and nothing much useful :)

[09:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: I'm working on it!

[09:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Quicker!

[09:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Knowing what not to do is useful.

[09:26:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, I realized I was typing to quickly just as I hit return :)

[09:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I meant nothing useful in terms of anything usable

[09:26:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, update: turns out the hard part (exposing browser-internal routines to public javascript) has (1) an easy solution, and (2) someone else already working on it.

[09:26:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
The rest of the infrastructure is just writing a webapp.

[09:26:05.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: What browser-internal things?

[09:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Like the ability to grab a pixel region from the page.

[09:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, I only care about the JS test acse

[09:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Not the taking a screenshot case :)

[09:27:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
We want to be able to do reftests.

[09:27:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, we want to

[09:27:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
They're pretty important for the CSSWG tests, frex.

[09:27:06.0000] <gsnedders>
But we don't nessisarily need identical code for visual tests and JS tests

[09:27:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
As in, we-can't-do-complete-testsuits-of-a-lot-of-specs-without-them.

[09:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
So, erm, what is the solution, who is working on it, and how robust is it?

[09:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Like, it's no problem to use one thing for visual tests and another for JS tests IMO

[09:28:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: The solution is to write an NPAPI extension that exposes it, the person working on it is Jeff Carollo here at Google, and I dunno how robust it is yet.

[09:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That won't work for IE, will it?

[09:28:04.0000] <jgraham>
Now I am scared

[09:28:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: IE does NPAPI, I think?

[09:28:06.0000] <gsnedders>
No, it doesn't

[09:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
I mean I see that *could* work (not for IE)

[09:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
But plugins are a unholy mess

[09:29:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, I have assurances that they'll expose whatever APIs we end up needing, so shrug.

[09:29:03.0000] <jgraham>
I would hate to make them a critical part of testing infrastructure

[09:29:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Sure, but they'll work for now, and then we can hack direct support in later.

[09:29:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Faster iteration!

[09:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why does there need to be a standard way to run reftests? Seems easier to have a standard way to write reftests, and browser-specific ways to run them

[09:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Indeed

[09:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, you write it once in NPAPI, then another time as an IE plugin.

[09:30:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE doesn't have a distinction between plugins and extensions.

[09:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
(and non-browser-specific ways to view both pages in an iframe for visual inspection)

[09:30:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: That's another option, sure.

[09:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It's important if you want to let people browse to a page, run some tests, and submit to the results

[09:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: That's not really a goal I have but it seems to be one that W3C has

[09:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
That seems a weird goal

[09:32:03.0000] <jgraham>
s/to//

[09:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
unless you want to test lots of obscure mobile browsers

[09:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
in which case the plugin approach won't help at all

[09:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, the plugins approach rather assumes that desktop is the only interesting class of device

[09:33:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Mobiles come later, if at all.  Some tests can be run in them, but they're definitely not a target.

[09:33:04.0000] <Philip`>
The plugins approach also assumes that people who want to run tests are willing to install a gigantic security vulnerability before running them

[09:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's not useful for random users to view the tests if they have non-default settings, unless the tests are specifically written to be robust against non-default settings.

[09:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Only to run the types of tests that require it.

[09:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
which doesn't seem a good idea for random non-developer users

[09:34:03.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: That seems odd given that mobiles are the new hotness

[09:34:04.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: and that there are reports of considerable variation between supposedly similar mobile browsers

[09:34:05.0000] <Philip`>
and non-random developers can just run custom browser reftest harnesses

[09:34:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Mobiles still intentionally violate all sorts of things.  I don't want to think about them yet.

[09:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: it is basically impossible to make tests robust against non-default settings

[09:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yes.

[09:35:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's more or less my point.

[09:35:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: My goal isn't necessarily for the testsuite to be run by non-developers.  Some parts of it will be runnable as that, and we'll expose them as such.  But some require more power than that, and there's no way around it.

[09:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
We're unlikely to use anything more than whatever manifest format you use for the reftests, FWIW.

[09:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: What is the problem with the current approach for tests that need access to browser internals, i.e. the browser developers write their own custom code that renders two pages and compares the pixels/rendertree/etc?

[09:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Is there a substantial difficulty with just standardising a manifest format and letting the browser makers sort it out?

[09:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/it/actually taking the screenshots/

[09:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
manifest format + test format + events needed for specifying when the screenshot is taken

[09:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: The problem is that that's slower.  We want to do that, but we can expose what we need faster by ourselves first.  Additionally, this gives us the flexibility to experiment with API, rather than just drafting up something from pure theory and hoping we got it right.

[09:37:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I expect Gecko will want to use something like their current reftest runner

[09:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Who is "we"?

[09:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, you can always change the authoring format later easily.  It's not like this is web content.  There will be very few authors.

[09:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
We = me and the other couple of people on the testing project (fantasai, arronei, jcarollo).

[09:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Changing thousands of tests is disappointingly hard

[09:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: where is all the discussion happening anyway?

[09:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Unless it can be done programmatically

[09:39:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: At the moment, in person.

[09:39:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me slaps TabAtkins 

[09:39:05.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: That's a big "unless"

[09:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Don't all browsers already expose reftest-like test runners that you could use with approximately no effort at all?

[09:40:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Not quite

[09:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't think so?  Chrome already has some internal APIs available to extensions for doing this, which we're exposing.

[09:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: there are big problems if you need to test something that renders later than the load event

[09:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
for example

[09:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
so you need a standardised hook to say "take the screenshot now" which the harness can pick up on. WHich might require more core

[09:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[09:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
(although maybe using js to dispatch a custom event is enough)

[09:42:03.0000] <jgraham>
(it depends...)

[09:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Anyway it seems like Chrome + Opera + Firefox all have ways to take screenshots

[09:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Exposed in a public-facing javascript api?

[09:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: No

[09:44:02.0000] <jgraham>
But that's not necessary

[09:44:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes it... is?

[09:44:04.0000] <jgraham>
Why?

[09:44:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can't expose a screenshot-taking API to public JS, that's a horrible security hole.

[09:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
The Mozilla reftests don't depend on a public-facing javascript API

[09:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
They use a class on the root element which the reftest harness monitors, plus an event

[09:45:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: I know.  What I mean is something that can be used outside of extensions or similar.  It's okay if it requires a compiler flag or similar.

[09:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Requiring special builds or special command line options seems bad

[09:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: I don't understand your objection.

[09:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Which objection?

[09:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The last one.  Either you need a special build, or you have public-facing APIs.

[09:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
No, you can have a perfectly normal build that runs in a special external-to-the-browser harness 

[09:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
where "external-to-the-browser" might mean "implemented as an extension"

[09:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So... that's what I said we're doing.

[09:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: No, you said you were using NPAPI to run the screenshot code as part of the content

[09:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't understand what value you see in that distinction.

[09:49:03.0000] <jgraham>
(I guess I really mean "external-to-the-content")

[09:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
At the moment I'm not interested in pursuing multiple harnesses if we can avoid it.  However, that section of the project is also the least interesting to me, and the most separate from the rest of the work I'm doing.

[09:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All that's actually required is that *something* runs some tests *somewhere* that are tracked by me, and reports the results in a particular format.

[09:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
One relies on installing a plugin which I have to remember to disable when not running tests to prevent a security hole and which has to be loaded as part of the test, which can itself affect the outcome of the test (by pushing the browser down odd codepaths, by delaying the load event, etc.). The other does not

[11:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://hg.hoppipolla.co.uk/hgwebdir.cgi/domharness/ is the sketchy draft of something that could be used as the basis for discussions about a good W3C DOM test harness

[11:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: BTW re: htmnl5lib in the stdlib, yes, we are interested, but I don't know how to make it happen

[11:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: I'll contact some people, see what's necessary

[11:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Great

[11:03:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me is going now, may or may not manage to coax home internet into functionality

[11:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What's jgraham's email?

[11:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: His IRC name @opera.com

[11:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
danke, Philip`.

[12:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even I know that 2 is 二, not 亼.

[12:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That makes 二 people who know that, then.

[13:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is there any other way to make up your own list-style-type, theoretically?  I tried something using ::marker, but it seems like that's not supported.

[13:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Yeah, use counters.  I don't know if all the bits that you'd need are supported, but they are specced at least.

[13:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Use counters how?

[13:10:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though probably split between Lists and G&Rc.

[13:10:04.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: are you going to do anything to try to promote an alternate proposal for atom conversion? I'm inclined to just do a call for consensus on removing it from (the w3c copy of) the spec

[13:10:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It doesn't look like those support made-up list counters.

[13:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: since you were the only objector and you haven't followed up in the past N weeks

[13:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why doesn't the list spec just allow you to give a string for list-style-type, I wonder?

[13:11:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: I know, I completely forgot about it.

[13:11:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: We had that request a few weeks ago, and agreed that it was a good idea.  When I pick up Lists I'll add it.

[13:11:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yay.

[13:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: I'll give you a definite yes/no on whether I'll write something by end of day.

[13:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting: http://lwn.net/Articles/387950/

[13:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"There are probably stronger ease-of-development arguments for making plugins enumeratable, but the example of IE shows that it is not strictly necessary.  We recommend that browsers switch to confirm-only testing for fonts and plugins, with an exponential backoff to prevent exhaustive searches by malicious javascript."

[13:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
"exponential backoff" sounds a lot like "performance regression"

[13:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, dunno about that part.

[13:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wonder if navigator.plugins could be made non-enumerable, though.

[13:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It doesn't seem like it would make much difference if you could still get the exact version of all the common plugins, though.

[13:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
They didn't get much less data from IE, which doesn't allow plugin enumeration.

[13:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interestingly, the list of installed fonts as returned by Flash or Java was a fairly big source of fingerprintability, especially since the order seemed to vary at random.  Someone recently requested some way to get a font list in some spec list, didn't they?

[13:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[13:43:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Clearly they were a hacker.

[13:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The EFF should file bugs about some of this stuff.

[13:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
exponential backoff on a synchronous API is not really workable

[13:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Which atom issue am I dealing with again?

[13:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: ISSUE-86 - see the email threads from last month in the archives

[13:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/status/issue-status.html#ISSUE-086

[13:45:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's what I thought.  I have a Change Proposal already recorded for that.

[13:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe you were the only one to object to the proposal to remove Atom

[13:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the Chairs asked if you would back down, and you said you wanted to try to convince more people to buy into your proposal or some variant of it

[13:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so the options are Call for Consensus on removing Atom if you no longer care to object, or probably a survey if you stand firm in your objection, or something else if you can actually build consensus around a different proposal

[13:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
last email on this from me: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Apr/1226.html

[13:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that was, like, a month ago

[13:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
brb

[13:50:00.0000] <Aleoss>
I agree, Atom should be deprecated like XHTML is swiftly becoming and ammendmants to feeds should be forwarded to a RSS 3.0

[13:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've heard conflicting things about Atom and RSS.

[13:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is there any practical difference?

[13:51:02.0000] <Aleoss>
Not really, no.

[13:51:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
MediaWiki used to advertise both RSS and Atom, but that was stupid, so I switched it to RSS only.  But another developer said Atom was more reliable or something and switched it to Atom.

[13:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me shrugs

[13:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Atom has more well-defined processing but less deployment

[13:52:02.0000] <Aleoss>
Aryeh: Reliable? No. They're equally reliable.

[13:52:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
He said he had some problem with an RSS feed being misparsed, or something.

[13:52:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Let me look it up.

[13:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/61026#c5171

[13:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Encoding ambiguity, apparently.

[13:55:00.0000] <Aleoss>
I disagree to that statement. RSS has been around longer than Atom, more browsers (and their older versions) are more compatible to RSS than Atom.

[13:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Are we talking real-world browsers or IE5?

[13:56:00.0000] <Aleoss>
Unless he is talking about MIME types. application/atom+xml VS application/rss+xml. Those 2 MIME types were proposed at the same time and prior to them was application/xml for feeds.

[13:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there are some RSS constructs where clients won't behave the same

[13:56:02.0000] <Aleoss>
In either case: His statement isn't correct.

[13:56:03.0000] <othermaciej>
in particular, how escaping of RSS contents that are HTML is handled is somewhat ambiguous

[13:56:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, well, he said he's seen problems personally.

[13:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Do you know of a particular significant feed reader that doesn't support Atom?

[14:49:00.0000] <aho>
the audio element... why is there no balance/panning? seems sorta odd to me

[14:50:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
aho: baby steps

[14:50:01.0000] <aho>
kay :)

[14:50:02.0000] <aho>
i wondered... that playback rate thing... does that work while looping?

[14:50:03.0000] <Philip`>
You can emulate panning by telling the user to rotate their head

[14:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
aho: yes

[14:52:00.0000] <aho>
glitch free?

[14:52:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
that's an implementation issue

[14:52:02.0000] <aho>
heh

[14:53:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i think currently only chrome supports playbackrate

[14:53:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
so you could try if it's glitch free in chrome

[14:53:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
if not, file a bug

[14:53:03.0000] <aho>
will do

[14:53:04.0000] <aho>
not today though... has been a really long day for me

[14:53:05.0000] <aho>
and i already did my fair share of just for fun js hacking 14 hours ago :>

[14:54:00.0000] <aho>
or 20

[14:54:01.0000] <aho>
can't really tell


2010-05-18
[17:17:00.0000] <nessy>
hmm… has anyone ever thought about using video as a background on web pages?

[17:19:00.0000] <nessy>
also… haw would you apply a gradient to a video?

[17:20:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
http://abduzeedo.com/web-inspiration-video-backgrounds

[17:20:01.0000] <mbrubeck>
Can videos have alpha channels?

[17:23:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah

[17:24:00.0000] <nessy>
that links only works in opera for me

[17:26:00.0000] <nessy>
oh, it's flash!

[17:26:01.0000] <nessy>
I'm looking for html5 video as a background

[17:28:00.0000] <nessy>
those are cool examples though

[17:29:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
The same thing should work with <video>

[17:33:00.0000] <nessy>
what … replacing the whole web page with a video, like flash is a whole-page flash there?

[17:34:00.0000] <nessy>
or are you saying it would be nice if we could use video as a background in CSS?

[17:34:01.0000] <mmn>
nessy: there was progress on allowing any element to be used as a CSS background: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506826

[17:36:00.0000] <nessy>
mmm - that looks cool - does it work for anything but images?

[17:37:00.0000] <nessy>
I might ask about videos in that bug actually

[17:38:00.0000] <mmn>
nessy: I think it's supposed to work for any element

[17:39:00.0000] <nessy>
that would be awesome

[17:39:01.0000] <nessy>
though I'm a bit doubtful - it says "A new CSS image type, -moz-element(#foo)"

[17:39:02.0000] <mmn>
http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2008/07/the_latest_feat.html mentions "live thumbnails"

[17:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It means "image" from the standpoint of CSS, i.e., so it can be used wherever CSS images can.

[17:40:01.0000] <roc>
that never landed on trunk

[17:40:02.0000] <roc>
it wasn't the right API for the things we wanted to do with it

[17:40:03.0000] <doublec>
That's the branch I used to make the demo here: http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2008/07/video-bling.html

[17:41:00.0000] <theMadness>
I mean, are there any languages where <ol> will display by default

[17:41:01.0000] <theMadness>
with localized, non-decimal numerals?

[17:41:02.0000] <theMadness>
Like, all the ancient ones?

[17:42:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
nessy: I was thinking you could just position a <video> behind the content, filling the viewport.

[17:42:01.0000] <nessy>
yeah, my ultimate aim is indeed to have reflections for the video

[17:43:00.0000] <nessy>
mbrubeck, I guess that would be possible - and use the z-dimension

[17:45:00.0000] <nessy>
webkit has the -webkit-box-reflect CSS property - is there any chance that is coming to CSS3?

[17:46:00.0000] <nessy>
roc: what is your thinking of what would be the right way to do video as background or reflections?

[17:47:00.0000] <roc>
for a lot of use cases you want some kind of <portal> element which can refer to other elements via an href *and* has a DOM interface that lets you explicitly pass in a DOM node to render

[17:48:00.0000] <roc>
I'm not sure about CSS reflections

[17:48:01.0000] <roc>
the Webkit property seems a bit too special-purpose

[17:48:02.0000] <roc>
maybe a pseudo-element

[17:51:00.0000] <nessy>
well, FAIK reflections right now require duplicating the element and then applying a gradient

[17:52:00.0000] <nessy>
then with a video you have to make sure the two videos run in sync

[17:52:01.0000] <nessy>
at least the webkit property avoids duplicating the element

[17:54:00.0000] <nessy>
so, right now, I can't do reflections for video in CSS only, right?

[17:55:00.0000] <doublec>
nessy, you can use canvas

[17:55:01.0000] <doublec>
nessy, so you don't need to duplicate the video and keep it in sync

[17:55:02.0000] <nessy>
yeah - that sounds painful compared to just a box-reflect property :)

[17:55:03.0000] <nessy>
but I guess that's how it will be :)

[17:56:00.0000] <doublec>
nessy, this would probably work: http://www.canvasdemos.com/2009/02/27/reflectionjs/

[17:56:01.0000] <doublec>
nessy, maybe with slight modifications to use video instead of image

[17:57:00.0000] <nessy>
thanks, will try

[17:57:01.0000] <doublec>
or use webkit's box-reflect :)

[17:59:00.0000] <nessy>
nah, only if CSS3 was actually looking at adding that property

[17:59:01.0000] <nessy>
I want to show the things that are possible now with existing specs

[18:00:00.0000] <nessy>
gradients on videos are the same problem, I guess?

[18:00:01.0000] <nessy>
http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/11/css-gradients-firefox-36/ has a nice example of a gradient on an image, but they are both used as background

[18:32:00.0000] <nessy>
hmm, I guess you can do gradients by putting a div on top of the video with a gradient as a background that has some transparency

[18:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
nessy: Yes, that's what you have to do, though it's fairly easy:

[18:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
<div class=videowrapper><video/></div> <style>.videowrapper { position: relative; } .videowrapper::after { position: absolute; top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0; background: -moz-gradient(left, white, rgba(255,255,255,0)); }</style>

[18:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, -moz-linear-gradient(), of course.

[19:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Note, though, that obviously this blocks any interaction with the controls.

[19:02:00.0000] <roc>
you can use pointer-events:none to get around that

[19:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, right.

[19:03:00.0000] <roc>
hmm, I wonder if a ::reflection pseudo-element would work

[19:05:00.0000] <roc>
video::reflection { transform:...; mask:...; opacity:...; }

[19:19:00.0000] <nessy>
oh, I didn't know about pointer-events!

[19:21:00.0000] <nessy>
oh, I love it!

[19:24:00.0000] <nessy>
though the controls are now faded, too :)

[20:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok so consider the following scenario:

[20:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
<track> is created

[20:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
src is set to A

[20:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's enabled

[20:38:04.0000] <Hixie>
A starts to download

[20:38:05.0000] <Hixie>
the track is disabled

[20:38:06.0000] <Hixie>
A continues to download, presumably

[20:38:07.0000] <Hixie>
now what if .src is changed?

[20:38:08.0000] <Hixie>
do we abort the download but not download a new file?

[20:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
do we not abort until the track is re-enabled?

[21:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
should i be firing load, abort, and error events at the <track> element?

[21:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
what if the .src is dynamically changed to something that can't be parsed as a url?

[21:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
should work the same as any other element referencing an external resource IMO

[21:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
they aren't all consistent

[21:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
for example, <track> can be disabled, but other elements generally can't

[21:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
some do cross-origin stuff, others don't

[21:51:00.0000] <nessy>
apart from the disabling, it should be consistent with other resource loading though, no?

[21:52:00.0000] <nessy>
when the track is disabled, we'd presumably want to stop downloading

[21:52:01.0000] <nessy>
and continue downloading if it is enabled again

[21:53:00.0000] <nessy>
if .src is changed and track is still active, we should abort the downloading then download the new resource

[21:53:01.0000] <nessy>
it's always about what should be available to the browser for display

[21:54:00.0000] <nessy>
load, abort and error events would be good to have on <track> if that is consistent with other external resource referencing elements

[21:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
stopping the download when the track is disabled would lead to bad ui, i think

[21:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
it would mean that if a user kept turning a track on to see if it was available, then turning it off if it wasn't, it would never get downloaded

[21:56:01.0000] <nessy>
how?

[21:56:02.0000] <nessy>
I wouldn't use "turning on" as a means to find out if it is available

[21:57:00.0000] <nessy>
don't we encourage the creation of a menu for that?

[21:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
the menu turns on and off the tracks

[21:58:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah, but just being listed in the menu means that something is available, so that's sufficient for that

[21:58:01.0000] <nessy>
if I turn a track on, I actually want to see it

[21:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
so e.g. if there were two tracks, one simple english and one with massive annotations, then they'd both be in the menu, but the user might keep switching from one to the other waiting for the second to be available

[21:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
which it would never be if we stopped the dowwnload each time he went back to the first one

[21:58:04.0000] <nessy>
are we making tracks alternatives of each other?

[21:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's entirely up to the user interface

[21:59:01.0000] <nessy>
in that situation, if I was the user, I would just turn on the second and wait until it starts displaying

[21:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
you might :-)

[21:59:03.0000] <nessy>
if I turn it off, I expect it to stop downloading

[22:00:00.0000] <nessy>
I look at the live situation - if I turn a track off, I'd want it to stop downloading and not continue getting a file that continues to grow

[22:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
for streaming titles that would indeed be a different issue, but i thought we'd decided not to support those out-of-band?

[22:01:01.0000] <nessy>
why? what would stop it from working?

[22:02:00.0000] <nessy>
maybe I wasn't present for that decision ;) or I have a bad memory ;)

[22:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
well if the track was enabled when the video was started, the video would never begin playing, for instance

[22:02:02.0000] <nessy>
ah, because we wait until its fully downloaded… hmmm

[22:03:00.0000] <nessy>
maybe it requires something similar to the video tag where there is "sufficient data" downloaded

[22:03:01.0000] <nessy>
i.e. there is enough to sync with the buffered video/audio

[22:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
or we can just not support infinite timed tracks :-)

[22:03:03.0000] <nessy>
we support live video, right?

[22:03:04.0000] <Hixie>
given that we expose the timed tracks in the API, infinite timed tracks would require infinite memory

[22:03:05.0000] <nessy>
so timed tracks wouldn't be that different

[22:03:06.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but we don't expose the video to the API

[22:04:00.0000] <nessy>
what do you mean?

[22:04:01.0000] <nessy>
we can get currentTime and stuff like that

[22:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but there's no way to get the video data

[22:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
you can get the cue data

[22:05:02.0000] <nessy>
you can through canvas, right?

[22:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
you can only get the currently playing frame

[22:05:04.0000] <nessy>
right ...

[22:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
you can get _all_ the cues

[22:06:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah, I see....

[22:06:01.0000] <nessy>
hmm, I'm just hesitant to make too many differences between handling data that comes our of a track in a video or from external

[22:06:02.0000] <nessy>
ideally we'd have the same API for both

[22:07:00.0000] <nessy>
but I see the difficulty...

[22:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
they're completely different things, i don't see how they could even have a similar API, let alone the same one

[22:08:00.0000] <nessy>
they're not actually that different

[22:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
in what way are they similar?

[22:08:02.0000] <nessy>
you can even have a video container that consists of links to other files that are the tracks and pulls them in - that's exactly the same as pulling them in through the markup

[22:08:03.0000] <nessy>
I think quicktime allows for that

[22:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not sure i understand what we're talking about any more

[22:09:00.0000] <nessy>
a video that has hyperlinks to media files instead of audio and video data inside it 

[22:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
start over. what are you suggesting in terms of what the design of the api should be?

[22:10:00.0000] <nessy>
the api to the tracks in the video file should be the same as the api to the externally linked files

[22:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[22:11:00.0000] <nessy>
what did you mean then by "they are completely different things" ?

[22:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
i meant video data vs text tracks

[22:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh, i see, you're saying that we have the same infinite text data problem with embedded tracks

[22:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[22:11:04.0000] <nessy>
ah, I meant text tracks from inside the video as opposed to external text tracks

[22:11:05.0000] <nessy>
yup :)

[22:12:00.0000] <nessy>
we could always collect cues and make those available that we have and not make predictions over future ones

[22:13:00.0000] <nessy>
a bit like videos don't have a duration when they are streaming

[22:14:00.0000] <nessy>
and like it's not possible to seek in live streams

[22:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's more the ones that correspond to points of the video before video.startTime that i'm worried about

[22:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how to discard them

[22:15:01.0000] <nessy>
do we need to?

[22:15:02.0000] <nessy>
hmm… I guess we do

[22:15:03.0000] <nessy>
since they legally don't really exist, I guess

[22:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
well from a practical perspective, we can't have infinite cues

[22:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
just like we can't have infinite video data

[22:16:01.0000] <nessy>
from before startTime won't be infinite - unless I'm missing something

[22:17:00.0000] <nessy>
a file has to start at some point

[22:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
startTime is the time up to which the UA has discarded data

[22:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not the start of the file

[22:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
the start of the file is time 0

[22:18:03.0000] <benschwarz_>
Hixie: I was looking for your e-mail yesterday

[22:18:04.0000] <nessy>
not necessarily - some files can start at an offset, in particular if they are streaming

[22:18:05.0000] <Hixie>
benschwarz_: ian⊙hc

[22:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
benschwarz_: it's at the top of the spec :-)

[22:19:01.0000] <benschwarz_>
Hixie: I just wanted to let you know I nabbed a quote of yours for a recent presentation

[22:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: for purposes of the aPI, that's still exposed as time=0

[22:19:03.0000] <benschwarz_>
Hixie: http://www.slideshare.net/benschwarz/take-back-the-web

[22:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
benschwarz_: cool

[22:19:05.0000] <nessy>
ah, we're talking playback offset time then, I guess

[22:20:00.0000] <benschwarz_>
Hixie: did you also see my post to public-html? 

[22:20:01.0000] <benschwarz_>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010May/0285.html

[22:20:02.0000] <nessy>
so, what is startTime then? is that the state of the buffering?

[22:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
benschwarz_: btw my name is Ian Hickson or Hixie, not Ian Hixie :-)

[22:20:04.0000] <benschwarz_>
I'm going to write a more considered post to the whatwg list

[22:20:05.0000] <benschwarz_>
Hixie: oh! sorry :) 

[22:20:06.0000] <benschwarz_>
I checked your web site and not a spec page

[22:21:00.0000] <benschwarz_>
but that might've been the rush of prepping for a presentation 2 hours before it started

[22:21:01.0000] <benschwarz_>
my apologies

[22:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: it's the earliest time available  - search for "earliest possible position" in the spec

[22:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
benschwarz_: saw your e-mail, but there was no technical feedback, so i didn't do anything with it :-)

[22:23:01.0000] <nessy>
ah, I thought you defined a new startTime for tracks

[22:24:00.0000] <nessy>
benschwarz_ you should have sent the link to your reformatted spec - I couldn't find it

[22:24:01.0000] <nessy>
wasn't looking hard though

[22:25:00.0000] <nessy>
I'm quite happy with the readability of the specs - no worse than any other technical documentation I've read

[22:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
benschwarz_: um btw, the "15" in "W3C Proposed Recommendation 15 December 1999" is the date :-)

[22:25:02.0000] <benschwarz_>
nessy: It simply isn't good enough for the weight of the world. 

[22:26:00.0000] <nessy>
Hixie: I'd still say that "before startTime" is no infinite because the stream has started reaching the browser at some point; in theory that timeline is infinite, yes, but it's not what the browser has to deal with

[22:26:01.0000] <benschwarz_>
Hixie: mm. oh well :) same difference

[22:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: before startTime isn't infinite; the point is that the user agent can discard data when it needs to to keep the resource requirements under control, and it makes sense to discard cue data from before that point as well especially if it came from the same file

[22:34:00.0000] <nessy>
yes, agreed

[22:35:00.0000] <nessy>
though it probably makes less sense to discard cue data than video data for sheer lack of volume (in general)

[22:52:00.0000] <ment>
/me wonders how far would google go with NaCl

[22:53:00.0000] <ment>
(on the range from silently it announcing on slashdot to printing full page ads with hearts in new york times)

[22:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: have you had time to look at the Khronos Typed Arrays spec yet?

[23:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[23:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
i commented on it earlier

[23:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
(in #whatwg)

[23:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[23:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if this goes forward and gets support from other browser vendors, I'm wondering what that'll mean for the various other binary-data proposals that have been under discussion

[23:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
at ECMA

[23:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

[01:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/2010/05/video/mediaevents.html is handy

[01:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, I was talking with a researcher at work who's interested in using the media API to do some things some things with video

[01:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
his question was whether the API provides a way to extract individual frames

[01:26:00.0000] <annevk>
drawImage

[01:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to look at drawImage spec

[01:28:00.0000] <annevk>
it just takes whatever the video displays currently and puts it on <canvas>

[01:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
  void drawImage(in HTMLVideoElement image, in float dx, in float dy, optional in float dw, in float dh);

[01:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what are dx and dy ?

[01:30:01.0000] <annevk>
position

[01:30:02.0000] <annevk>
on the canvas grid

[01:30:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, yeah, OK

[01:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so you could call this each time there's a frame change?

[01:31:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, seems that once a <track> is loading putting it on disabled should not cause it to stop loading

[01:31:02.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, should prolly work similarly to how <link rel=stylesheet> works; that has pretty much the same issues as far as I can tell

[01:31:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: or what event could I use to call it?

[01:32:00.0000] <annevk>
is it important that the video plays back smoothly?

[01:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
no

[01:32:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
he just wants to be able to grab each frame

[01:33:00.0000] <annevk>
otherwise it's prolly better to figure out the framerate and then use seeking and seeking events

[01:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, that's what I had said I thought would work

[01:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
to him

[01:33:03.0000] <annevk>
ought to work :)

[01:33:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[01:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I reckon this is the kind of thing that JS libraries can eventually provide some convenience methods for

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: does changing .href on <link> cause a stylesheet load to abort?

[01:37:00.0000] <annevk>
pretty sure it does

[01:37:01.0000] <annevk>
no reason for it to continue

[01:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: "[video.startTime] It might not be zero if the clip's timeline is not zero-based" - http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/video.html#video

[01:45:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: re http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100518#l-283

[01:45:02.0000] <annevk>
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39259 -- cool (via Peter`)

[01:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: although i would be fine with changing the spec so that startTime is 0 even for non-zero-based videos

[01:47:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders why they keep the version in the file names

[01:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: huh, what do you know

[01:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me tends to think zcorpan_ knows quite a lot

[01:50:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, what's the point of startTime then?

[01:53:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: it updates for streaming video when video data is discarded

[01:53:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: although buffered.start(0) also does that

[01:53:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe we should remove startTime and just have buffered.start(0)

[01:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders what application/srgs+xml is

[01:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[01:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
startTime != buffered.start(0)

[01:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
the data at startTime might not be buffered

[01:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
startTime is just the earliest point that's ever accessible

[01:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
startTime might be equivalent to seekable.start(0)

[01:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd have to think about that to be sure

[01:58:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
oh, right, seekable.start(0)

[01:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: have you or others from Apple chimed on in the Typed Arrays draft spec yet?

[01:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I know olliej is interested

[01:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I plan to read over it very soon

[01:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
k

[01:59:03.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I would like to propose changes to make it serve the use cases I envisioned for BinaryData

[01:59:04.0000] <othermaciej>
so there can be one true way to represent synchronously accessible in-memory binary data

[02:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
use cases.. would be good to have somebody collect those

[02:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Typed Arrays are an agenda item for the upcoming TC-39 meeting

[02:00:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, good

[02:00:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
about time

[02:00:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
when is that meeting?

[02:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
one try way would be great..

[02:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe it is the 24th and 25th of this month

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
Kanji beats English by almost 2.5 to 1

[02:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but from the little I know about TC-39 I suspect that getting agreement on the one try way for this is not going to be very quick or smooth

[02:02:02.0000] <annevk>
toally unfair on twitter

[02:02:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: the character count you mean?

[02:02:04.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, yeah, http://twitter.com/annevk/status/14214874107

[02:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[02:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I figured it took at least twice as much for a normal message in English

[02:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so the lesson here is that everybody should learn Japanese and tweet in Japanese

[02:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
for the greatest efficiency

[02:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
actually, I guess Chinese might be even more efficient

[02:04:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
but maybe not

[02:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I was thinking that because Chinese doesn't have a separate phonetic alphabet like Japanese does

[02:05:01.0000] <abarth>
hi gsnedders 

[02:05:02.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, hmm yeah

[02:05:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
but then I realized, it's the same count anyway, because you're just using the logograms for phonetic purposes

[02:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
abarth: Hey, I saw your email; short answer is no.

[02:07:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
twitter should translate to english before applying the character count

[02:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: yeah, that would even the playing field

[02:07:02.0000] <abarth>
gsnedders: thanks.  did you author the existing tests by hand/

[02:09:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: watcha up to tonight?

[02:09:01.0000] <boblet>
or in other words, check yo email

[02:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: meetings from 7pm til midnight, unfortunately

[02:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: but can meet up with you all tomorrow night

[02:14:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: ouch. Red Bar at 12:30 then? :D j/k (orishe?)

[02:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
no Red Bar for me tonight

[02:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
not in the mood to deal with Yuji

[02:15:02.0000] <boblet>
heh

[02:15:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: you'll still be in town tomorrow night?

[02:17:00.0000] <boblet>
CSS issue, but no way to calculate device ppi because CSS absolute units use 96dpi-derived (not calculated) cms. big pita given current mobile landscape

[02:17:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: yeah here til Thurs

[02:17:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
k

[02:23:00.0000] <boblet>
where do wwwstyle ppl hang out on IRC? … here? :|

[02:23:01.0000] <annevk>
here mostly I guess

[02:23:02.0000] <annevk>
#CSS on irc.w3.org:80 is somewhat reserved for the CSS WG

[02:25:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: is that private?

[02:26:00.0000] <boblet>
aah web-based

[02:27:00.0000] <annevk>
not sure what the policy is, it's logged

[02:27:01.0000] <annevk>
and it's not web-based... it's an IRC channel

[02:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
abarth: I authored very few of them, they're just the tests from html5lib

[02:30:00.0000] <abarth>
ok, thanks

[02:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
abarth: A load of them were programmatically created by Philip`, hsivonen tends to write the majority of new ones nowadays AFAIK, zcorpan_ hand-wrote a whole load for the script parsing

[02:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is at his desk again

[02:30:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie wrote the initial batch

[02:31:00.0000] <annevk>
James and I added a couple; the rest is how gsnedders sketched it

[02:31:01.0000] <annevk>
if this is about html5lib tests

[02:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
I add some when we have bugs that get fixed

[02:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what the original question was

[02:36:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: thanks — left a question there. what settings are you using for #CSS btw? tried irc.w3.org:80 and :6667 but doesn’t seem to connect in Colloquy

[02:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
some opera person should point emoller to the <device> part of the spec

[02:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan_: ^

[02:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
(if the question was something like "do we have a way of autogenerating interesting cases from the spec" the answert is "no but that is something I would really like")

[02:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what is an "emoller"?

[02:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: who, not what

[02:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[02:39:01.0000] <annevk>
boblet, besides 80, 6665 ought to work

Remember kids, proprietry is best!

[03:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
"""[...] you get the experience of HTML on the Web, where the kind of browser, hardware and OS you use determines what your experience"""

[03:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
I take it he has never tried to use flash on mobile then

[03:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
Unless he is claiming that consistent awfulness is a virtue?

[04:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: http://twitter.com/ronanklyne/statuses/14218178122

[04:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
JP: Why isn’t Flash an open standard?

[04:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
CG: It is. What are you talking about?

[04:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . .

[04:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
"If you look at the amount of time it will take HTML5 to become a reasonably solid platform, it’s going to take a long time because there are an awful lot of vested interests trying to influence its development."

[04:08:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Thankfully, the editorial process at the WHATWG insures that vested interests can all jump off a bridge, unless they're held by browser implementers.

[04:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
that remains to be seen

[04:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
since the WHATWG is pretty much deferring to the W3C

[04:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
and it would take a pretty big vested interest to change that

[04:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So far the only deference to the W3C has been on basically editorial matters, or matters that pertain only to the W3C spec, no?

[04:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or things that are fairly unimportant.

[04:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was going to say the opposite

[04:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
the only things that the whatwg has done differently is editorial things

[04:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. spec organisation

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
but so far there haven't been any cases of decisions made by the w3c that are controversial and non-editorial

[04:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What I meant was that when the W3C has overruled the WHATWG (= you), it's been mostly editorial, and unimportant when not editorial.

[04:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[04:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
so far

[04:19:03.0000] <Hixie>

innerHTML is IE is far more brittle than I had thought

hmm, in gecko i get "<input type="disabled">" for innerHTML of <input disabled="">

[04:44:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
um

[04:44:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
i mean i get "<input disabled="disabled">"

[05:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
That's not Semantic enough. We need <html src="file.rdf">

[05:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
So that users can define their own tag ontologies

[05:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hrm. contentDocument.open() doesn't work on an iframe that's not in a document :-(

[05:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
speaking of replacing attributes .. http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AaYxrITemjbxZGNmZzc5cHpfM2Ryajc5Zmhx&hl=en .. <input type=speech> spec proposal also proposes adding "grammar" and "grammartype" attributes

[05:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
we all remember how much we loved the word "grammar" in school

[05:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Quite a bit, but not as much as syntax?

[05:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I never had a Syntax Book

[05:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I did have a Grammar Book

[05:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
which I did my best to abuse as much as possible

[05:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe it's just a kneejerk reaction, but I feel like any feature that'd require the use of a "grammar" attribute can't be a step in the right direction

[05:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the spec seems like a case of overengineering

[05:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or at least like way too much overloading of the input element

[05:41:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but the use cases do seem important

[05:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the uses cases being things like doing Web searches by voice, adding voice to turn-by-turn directions/navigations

[05:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
an translation applications with voice

[05:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
this just doesn't strike me at least as the most obviously optimal way to provide a feature for those use cases

[05:44:00.0000] <Peter`>
It overlaps with <device> quite a bit

[05:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, annevk asked about that on the list already, I think

[05:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Shouldn't such input be media-independent?

[06:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. After making a demo that fails gracefully in IE8, I can understand the frustration Web authors have with IE

[06:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the way IE deals with absent properties on host objects is... annoying

[06:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
could someone with IE9 Platform Preview tell me what happens when loading http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/detect-html5-parser.html please?

[06:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if innerHTML malfunctions in IE8 when the node is not in the document...

[06:19:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: iirc innerHTML works fine for nodes outside the document

[06:21:00.0000] <Peter`>
hsivonen: will know in a couple of minutes, rebooting to windows 7

[06:24:00.0000] <Peter`>
hsivonen: script error encountered

[06:24:01.0000] <Peter`>
"Object expected" in detect-html5-parser.js on line 76

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Peter`: what about on reload now (I changed line 76)

[06:25:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: should we expose the subprotocol to script? a script can open a connection without asking for a subprotocol, but the server can reply with one (which the client ignores)

[06:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: for limited values of "fine", it appears

[06:26:02.0000] <Peter`>
hsivonen: ^

[06:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Peter`: thank you!

[06:26:04.0000] <Peter`>
No problem!

[06:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
better than IE8 but nowhere close to compliant

[06:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me pointed to hsivonen's test in the ie9 bug he filed a few days ago

[06:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: what's limited?

[06:31:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: innerHTML on <html> and <table> doesn't work in ie even when they're in the document

[06:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, how can I find out if all files in a folder are identical?

[06:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
If not, which ones differ from some reference?

[06:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: most tests in my demo never get as far as having a non-null e.firstChild in IE8

[06:47:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: ok. weird

[06:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me gets reminded of FILE DIR as arguments for diff

[06:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: diff -r dir1 dir2

[06:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
if you mean comparing two parallel directories

[06:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you mean comparing all the files within a directory to each other, md5sum *|sort and then look for odd ones out

[06:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Next random question: is there any way to add a 5s delay to all requests to Apache httpd?

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[06:53:01.0000] <gsnedders>
How?

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me shrugs

[06:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
I guess you could use mod_perl and set a PerlPostReadRequestHandler that does "sleep 5" or something along those lines

[06:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
(or copy-and-paste a proxy server example from some asynchronous networking framework and add a delay call into that, so that you don't tie up expensive Apache processes)

[07:06:00.0000] <nessy>

another product from the plh workshop

[07:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, he does some useful things now and then :)

[07:08:01.0000] <nessy>
a specific workshop that he held or just general "the works"?

[07:08:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
his personal workshop

[07:08:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I meant

[07:09:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah - totally awesome

[07:09:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
he could log more details about the timeranges objects

[07:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: yeah, there's a few more things that could be added

[07:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
like a way to do looping

[07:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.w3.org/2010/05/video/mediaevents.html crashed my Minefield!

"The @w3c validator is down. Suddenly I feel very naked. How hard would it be to write an independent TextMate bundle?"

[07:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't use TextMate but I assume a "bundle" is a TextMate extension or plugin or whatever

[07:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
That sounds... non trivial

[07:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, making something that just called an already-installed local instance of the validator.nu backend would not seem too touch 

[07:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
*tough

[07:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>

[10:23:00.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Hello.

[10:26:00.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Is there a way to take the value of a single (checked) radio button inside a group of radio buttons? I mean, without having to go through each one's value, but more like a single one with the value of the radio button selected.

[10:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . Why is an empty <ul></ul> valid in HTML5?

[10:27:01.0000] <KaOSoFt>
I'm thinking PHP here, but perhaps there is a method to filter it like that in simple HTML.

[10:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Why shouldn't it be?

[10:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess it makes no less sense than an empty div.

[10:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I like it being allowed so I can write: print "<ul>"; print "<li>$_" for @items; print "</ul>"; etc without having to worry about the @items == 0 case specially)

[10:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That kind of thing seems inelegant to me.  You leave artifacts in the markup that are meaningless vestiges of how you composed it.

[10:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Laziness wins over elegance

[10:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
given that it works fine in all practical aspects (i.e. in rendering)

[10:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: The idea was you might fill it in with script or so later iirc

[10:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, but it annoys me.  It's sloppy.  Like how the new skin on Wikipedia has horribly confusing whitespace.  If you look at the source code, you'll see it's because it's neatly formatted with <?php ?> without regard to what whitespace this introduces in the output.

[10:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've also been known to add code to avoid <foo bar="baz"> becoming <foo > when the bar attribute is omitted.

[10:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And carefully echoing "\n\t\t\t" and such at various points.

[10:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess I'm a little obsessive-compulsive, though.  :/

[10:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, that makes more sense.

[10:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: You need a Tidy filter after the PHP has generated its stuff

[10:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
We do, but we're going to have to get rid of it because Tidy probably can't handle HTML5 (let alone HTML5+MathML, etc.).  Actually we've had problems with Tidy for a long time, it's inflexible and changes incompatibly between versions.

[10:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
We have our own built-in sanitizer, but it doesn't work as well or something, I've been told.

[10:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
(By "Tidy", I meant an HTML5-compatible Tidy-like tool that probably isn't actually Tidy)

[10:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, you win.  https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23575#c2

[10:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Ifr you can run java you should write a sanitizer based on the validator.nu html parser

[10:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Source-code prettiness has always won out over generated-html prettiness for me.  I've tried to be conscious of how my source-code turned out.  I stopped that pretty quick.

[10:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, isn't there a PHP parser too?

[10:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: True

[10:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
But is is slow

[10:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
We could use that, and use the Java one optionally for performance.  Or the C++ version used by Mozilla, so we could adapt it to be a PHP module.

[10:45:04.0000] <jgraham>
I assumed you wanted reasonable perf

[10:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's always a tradeoff.  MW already has some pieces that are slow because they're written in PHP, and for decent perf you need to install a PHP module.

[10:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It kind of stinks if you're on shared hosting.

[10:46:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But, oh well.

[10:46:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hopefully someone will eventually write a java-to-non-Gecko-C++ translator for the validator.nu parser

[10:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's the cool thing about a standardized parsing algorithm, we'll reliably have interoperable parsers in various languages.  :)

[10:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hopefully more languages will have standard HTML5 parsing libraries in the future.

[10:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed

[10:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Now we'd just have to write a sanitizer that works with a DOM . . .

[10:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: You got my email about html5lib stuff?

[10:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Yeah

[10:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
Need to ressurect the python 3 port

[10:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
and then work out how to generate python 2 from python 3

[10:49:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I doubt a 2.x library would be pulled into stdlib at his point.

[10:49:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
There's a 3to2 program.

[10:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, how would we use a Java sanitizer?  Could we pass it the HTML5 and maybe get back well-formed XML so that we could parse that on the PHP side?  It would be a pain to implement the actual sanitization logic in both PHP and Java.

[10:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
Right, but it isn't magic

[10:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's not!?! ;_;

[10:50:03.0000] <jgraham>
I doubt it :)

[10:50:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
You could just wait for Python 2.8, which'll be 3 by another name.

[10:50:05.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Presumably you give it a string, it returns a string

[10:50:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, any hope of a PHP standard library?  What's even the procedure for that?

[10:50:07.0000] <jgraham>
you use stdio to communicate

[10:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I imagine they'd want it in C or something.

[10:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, yeah, so that makes it kind of hard to get a DOM . . .

[10:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well, I have other things on my plate right now.

[10:51:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although I'll put this on my to-do list.

[10:51:04.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Oh you need a DOM to be returned, not just a string?

[10:51:05.0000] <jgraham>
That would be harder, yes

[10:51:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, we'd want to have the sanitization logic in PHP only, preferably.

[10:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
We don't want to keep the same logic implemented in both PHP and Java.

[10:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
(I assumed if you were already using tidy then subcontracting the whole thing to an external porgram would be fine)

[10:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikimedia is, but we don't rely on Tidy by default.

[10:52:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, we don't like relying on non-PHP code we write ourselves, because most MediaWiki developers won't know whatever language it is.

[10:52:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Tidy is an intact external program that we don't need to maintain.

[10:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(a while back there was XSS in EasyTimeline, and it wasn't fixed for days after being reported, because it's written in Perl . . .)

[10:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
It doesn't seem that sort of problem would be any easier to fix if the program is just an "intact external program"

[10:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
(it may even be harder if source isn't avaliable)

[10:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, of course, but we can expect upstream to maintain the security fixes in that case.

[10:55:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
We're the only ones who control EasyTimeline or texvc or whatever, so we have to fix them if they'll get fixed at all.

[11:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: there's a class that abstract out the Gecko stuff waiting for you to subclass it...

[11:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(writing an HTML sanitizer is on my todo list)

[11:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, awesome.

[11:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
we need on for HTML-in-RSS in Firefox

[11:12:00.0000] <KaOSoFt>
For some reason http://validator.w3.org/ is loading really slow. Is it only me?

[11:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
People should just... not try and pretend that they know how to do logic.  Particularly, using "QED" as an attempt to end an argument with a laughably fallacious proof just makes you look retarded.

[11:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Are you trying to argue with the axiomatic proof?

[11:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
YOU CAN'T DEFEAT THE AXIOMATIC PROOF

[11:44:00.0000] <jwalden>
NO ONE DEFEATS THE AXIOMATIC PROOF

[11:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, only mathematicians should attempt logical proofs.

[11:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I'm looking at philosophers here)

[11:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
In practice, it turns out that actual logic is rarely very useful outside of mathematics.

[11:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Usually the interesting question is which axioms to pick, rather than their logical consequences.  Except in mathematics, because we don't care what axioms you pick, it's all good.

[11:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's especially sad is when people cite the names of logical fallacies (which they typically don't understand) instead of, you know, actually pointing out why someone's reasoning is flawed.

[12:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: I agree on all counts.

[12:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And that was the problem here.  There were several hidden assumptions being used that made the conclusion correct if you accepted all of them, but the right thing to do was to challenge one of the assumptions, which was unreasonable.

[12:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So trying to pretend like using a logical argument made the argument open-and-shut was stupid.

[12:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which post was this?

[12:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
One of Andrew's latest things on the flexbox threads.

[12:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
TabAtkins: That's the thing with axioms, if they are your axioms you don't see any need to question them

[12:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you are a geometer, then working from axioms makes sense

[12:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Geometers are mathematicians.

[12:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that would be an example of the axiom of subsets

[12:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sigh.  ^_^

[12:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(or Axiom Schema of Specification if you want to be all fussy)

[12:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, assuming you use a theory based on ZF.  What if you use finitely-axiomatized NBG?  Then there are no axiom schemas.  :)

[12:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: it's too early in the morning for me to try reasoning about proper classesw

[12:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, specification only says that if the set of mathematicians exists, then the set of all mathematicians that are also geometers exists, if "is a geometer" can be expressed as a first-order statement.  It doesn't prove that geometers are mathematicians.

[12:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
no, you don't understand, I have an axiomatic proof

[12:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, then I stand corrected.

[12:48:02.0000] <roc>
does disabling script via <iframe sandbox> disable plugins too?

[12:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I thought all plugins are disabled in sandboxes, unless you can verify that they'll obey the sandboxing.

[12:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe <iframe sandbox> disables plugins by default, currently

[12:49:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't there an allow-plugins keyword?

[12:53:00.0000] <roc>
aah right thanks

[12:53:01.0000] <roc>
there isn't

[12:53:02.0000] <roc>
I guess the theory being that if you allow plugins you have no control over what the plugin might do

[12:54:00.0000] <weinig>
/me just learned that google image search uses <iframe sandbox>

[12:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
weinig: whoah rilly?

[12:56:01.0000] <weinig>
othermaciej: yup

[12:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that's mildly terrifying!

[13:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
Why only mildly?

[14:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The fact that I make this kind of post is why Slashdot takes too much of my time and I need to stop reading it: http://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1655340&cid=32257928

[14:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The truth is irrelevant, you're from wikipedia and should know this already

[14:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sigh.

[14:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least if Wikipedia says something blatantly false, I can correct it.

[14:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
As long as it's *sufficiently* blatant that no one's likely to argue with the change.

Doesn't sound useful, then.  My objection to Slashdot is the preponderance of idiots who get upmodded because they sound confident.

[15:07:02.0000] <deltab>
ah, okay

[15:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
woah

[15:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
the old html parser in gecko treated all unknown elements as equivalent for the purposes of end tag matching?

W3C Working Draft 19 November 2009

[18:45:00.0000] <bl4ckcomb>
hi, can someone clarify whether <command ... /> (validated by w3's validator) is valid or if it should be <command ...></command> (parsed correctly in chrome and mozilla) ?

[18:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's neither actually

[18:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
supposed to be just <command>

[18:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
like <img>

[18:50:00.0000] <bl4ckcomb>
Hixie, it seems to validate (w3's validator) as <command>, but then again the browsers don't parse it correctly (they add a closing tag and nest sibling <command> elements) :(

[20:22:00.0000] <wirepair>
does any browser besides chrome/chromium implement the sandbox attribute for iframes?

[20:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wirepair: it's in WebKit trunk but not yet in a shipping version of Safari

[20:42:00.0000] <wirepair>
cool thanks

[22:13:00.0000] <wirepair>
there's nothing like IE8's toStaticHtml defined in html5 correct?

[01:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: can you think of any Mozilla developers who might take an interest in picking up work on implementing support for the progress element?

[02:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>

hsivonen, /a /a%20

[02:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: thanks

[02:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
for now, I'm going to pretend that space characters are ' ', '\r', '\n' and '\t', since that's what most of the above-DOM layers of Gecko think

[02:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is quite unhappy that HTML5 doesn't agree

[02:13:02.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/html/wg/href/draft is what you are looking for I suppose but it's not entirely up to date with all latest findings (but then nothing is)

I do know it wasn't in Web Forms 2.0

[02:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[02:25:00.0000] <annevk>
be interesting to know the use case

[02:26:00.0000] <annevk>
localized version of type=year could be way more rich than you can get with type=number

[02:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: what would a localized version do?

[02:29:00.0000] <annevk>
for certain locales it could offer different calendars as input

[02:29:01.0000] <annevk>
but then it depends on the use case whether that would actually work, of course

[02:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I think the start and end of years in different calendars don't match Gregorian years

[02:30:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah...

[02:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I like the build times on my i7 box that's smaller than a Mac Pro and that Apple wouldn't sell me

[02:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
of course, things could always be faster

/me blames C++ for having an archaic file dependency model

[03:21:00.0000] <roc>
MikeSmith: why should the progress element be a priority?

[03:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: because there's now another actual implementation of it, with some refinements still being made

[03:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and it might be good to have at least another implementation in the works at the same time

[03:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and because it's one of the few remaining new elements that hasn't been implemented yet

[03:24:01.0000] <roc>
I think there are heaps of <input> element types that aren't implemented yet

[03:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
true

[03:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I don't think it's necessarily an either-or

[03:41:00.0000] <volkmar>
oups, i miss him

oh great - we're gonna discuss whether PHP is HTML again?

[05:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does anyone actually edit PHP files in supposedly-HTML editors, or is it all hypothetical?

[05:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't remember having seen any concrete examples of people successfully doing that

[05:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
(which makes the discussion seem a bit pointless)

[05:08:00.0000] <annevk>
I think Dreamweaver has support; prolly others too

[05:08:01.0000] <annevk>
I've seen plenty of editors that support mixed syntax-highlighting too

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I would have thought it was clear that polyglot was about an intersection--not about a union of features. sigh.

[06:15:00.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: yes dreamweaver, textmate, handles the fact to have php. For example, authoring tool parsers must be aware of php(|something else) language for syntax coloring. 

[06:15:01.0000] <karlcow>
but as hsivonen is saying. The way to address the comment is about the intersection of features and I would go a bit further by saying in the realm of http. 

[06:17:00.0000] <karlcow>
The question of glazou is interesting, but in the realm of authoring tool, which as usual is not really addressed in html5.

[06:18:00.0000] <annevk>
it is addressed karlcow

[06:19:00.0000] <annevk>
but PHP+HTML is not defined

[06:19:01.0000] <annevk>
that should not be up to us, but to the PHP guys

[06:19:02.0000] <karlcow>
annevk: s/PHP/templating and programming languages/ 

[06:20:00.0000] <karlcow>
maybe it should be up to authoring tools developers but that would require a precise list of requirements/issues. 

[06:20:01.0000] <karlcow>
Maybe it's a set of constraints which could live in a separate document

[06:21:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me is thinking and doesn't have a solution

[06:22:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems something to compete over really

[06:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
I don't see why PHP is special

[06:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
RoR or Django are just as popular today

[06:22:03.0000] <annevk>
it's not

[06:22:04.0000] <annevk>
not sure that's true

[06:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think Glazou thinks its special

[06:25:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me would avoid to think about what Glazou thinks. Let him express his own thoughts.

[06:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well I mean he did express his thoughts. They were about PHP, not templating languages in general

[06:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the only reason why PHP is more special than other conceptually similar templating languages in that PHP chooses to use a syntaxt that deliberately looks like a PI

[06:31:00.0000] <workmad3>
PHP certainly is special... goes to special school and everything :)

[08:38:00.0000] <zcorpan_>

http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9766 - should it be called websocket.protocol or websocket.subprotocol?

So it looks like we did indeed release vp8 freely.

[10:12:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I can't find the specification anywhere...

[10:12:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It just says "based on matroska"

[10:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
?_?

[10:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Is it a delta spec?

[10:13:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't understand what you're asking.

[10:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, got it.

[10:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Um, I dunno.  I suggest checking the Code page.

[10:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I guess this is all there is for now: http://www.webmproject.org/code/specs/container/

Arghl

[10:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Why do people insist on mixing in non-HTML document formats in the polyglot discussion?

[10:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
haha. Håkon just said, re the Norwegian 17th of May celebration video he showed at google I/O: "We do this every year to celebrate the video element" :-D

[10:25:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Unprocessed PHP code isn't HTML

[10:25:03.0000] <Lachy>
he's demoing WebM support in Opera

[10:25:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
ARGH I'M MISSING THE KEYNOTE AND HAKON

[10:25:05.0000] <Philip`>
Is WebM currently / going to be supported more widely than Theora?

[10:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, it's in FF and Webkit nightlies now.

[10:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is it likely to be in Safari?

[10:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Flash is on the supporter list

[10:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suspect so.

[10:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And Opera is going with a beta soon.

[10:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wonder if we pulled MS into this?

[10:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
From my reading of the container spec, a regular matroska splitter should be able to handle webm, so support could get in via regular codec packs too

[10:29:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Needs VP8 added, of course :)

[10:29:02.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, existing tools just need to add support for the "webm" doctype. But otherwise, yes, WebM is a strict subset of MKV

[10:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, and they need the VP8 codec to play videos

[10:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
support in mkvmerge is coming soon. mkvaldiator and mkclean are already out for working with webm

[10:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: If the Flash player will support it then that sounds good, since you only need to encode your video once and you can have decent fallback in all browsers

[10:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup, Adobe CTO is up on stage talking about it right now.

[10:31:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Is the blog really supposed to be private?

[10:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suspect that's a mistake.

[10:34:00.0000] <Rik`>
What about WebM and live streaming ?

[10:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
Rik`, live streaming could theoretically be done with VP8. But the video element isn't really optimised for live streaming in HTML yet

[10:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
Skype, for example, is adopting VP8 for video conferencing

[10:35:02.0000] <Rik`>
great

[10:35:03.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think they'll be using the webm container though

[10:35:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Someone started looking at the markup

[10:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
<a href="http://www.android.com"><img src="/media/images/logos/android.jpg" title="Android" alt=""></a>

[10:36:01.0000] <jwalden>
nice alt-attributing there

[10:36:02.0000] <Lachy>
all this webm stuff is really old news to me though now. I've known for a month. I'm just waiting for a response from Apple and Microsoft

[10:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
We're horrible with accessibility.  ;_;

[10:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Hey, let the rest of us be excited that we finally got confirmation.

[10:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders what company will be the first to sue over patents in VP8

[10:37:03.0000] <Lachy>
Yay, he just announced VP8 in Flash :-)

[10:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, don't you work for Google now? Didn't you know?

[10:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
No!  They were very secretive.

[10:38:02.0000] <Lachy>
wow

[10:38:03.0000] <Dashiva>
http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377

[10:38:04.0000] <Rik`>
Lachy: I bet the answer will be "hardware support?"

[10:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: You do realize most large tech companies are like that?

[10:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nobody cares about leaks from Opera, since no one can understand norwegian anyway.

[10:39:02.0000] <Lachy>
haha

[10:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
Rik`, the answer to what?

[10:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, you mean from Microsoft and Apple?

[10:41:02.0000] <Rik`>
yep

[10:41:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, my guess is that Apple and Microsoft will come back with 2 responses: 1. Patent trolls. 2. Hardware support not yet available.

[10:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
But it's coming soon, see the hardware vendors listed on webmproject.org

[10:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The x264 article claims part of vp8 is extremely similar to h264

[10:42:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Intra Prediction section

[10:43:00.0000] <Rik`>
Lachy: I'd like to, but the blog is closed right now

[10:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
We're obviously willing to swallow the patent risk.

[10:44:00.0000] <jcranmer>
if hardware vendors are implementing it, they're willing to do patent risk

[10:44:01.0000] <jcranmer>
at which point the target audience is very broad

[10:45:00.0000] <jcranmer>
it's harder to argue patent risk

[10:49:00.0000] <Rik`>
what about subtitles and multiple audio tracks in WebM ?

[10:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Not just part of it

"VP8 is simply way too similar to H.264: a pithy, if slightly inaccurate, description of VP8 would be “H.264 Baseline Profile with a better entropy coder”. Though I am not a lawyer, I simply cannot believe that they will be able to get away with this, especially in today’s overly litigious day and age. Even VC-1 differed more from H.264 than VP8 does, and even VC-1 didn’t manage to escape the clutches of software patents."

oh, the x264 guy is ripping into vp8 again

[11:51:01.0000] <virtuelv>
http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377

[11:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm.  Given that webm uses a subset of the matroska format, does that mean that any player that understands matroska and has a vp8 codec will play webm?

[11:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me doesn't know enough about video technical details.

[11:55:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Except the doctype name, apparently yes

[11:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not sure how much the doctype actually means in mkv files

[11:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, players need to add support for the webm doctype. In EBML, you need to understand the doctype in order to parse the file properly

[12:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
at least, if your implementation is following EBML, and isn't just assuming that any EBML file is a Matroska file.

[12:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
mkvinfo, however, already does ignore the doctype, and parses any file like matroska

[12:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So is it accurate or not for Microsoft to say that as long as someone has a vp8 codec on their system, IE9 will automatically play webm?

[12:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You need support for both the container and the video codec

[12:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(and the audio, does windows 7 come with vorbis?)

[12:02:00.0000] <daedb>
Vorbis is not included in any version of Windows

[12:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes. The DirectShow filters should add support

[12:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
I can't figure out from the set of IEBlog posts whether IE9 will support any video formats that are supported by DirectShow

[12:03:01.0000] <daedb>
/me just tested a 720p WebM vid from Youtube i WMP after installing the Directshow filters, and it works great

[12:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
or whether they're specifically filtering it to only allow H.264/VP8

[12:03:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Sounds like the former.

[12:04:00.0000] <daedb>
Didn't they say earlier that they weren't going to allow any random DS codec in IE9?

[12:04:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Is there a lenna.webm? :)

[12:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Let me know if you find any clear quotes saying that :-)

[12:05:01.0000] <Philip`>
Um

[12:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
daedb: ^

[12:05:03.0000] <Lachy>
daedb, if you have 5.1 channel audio support, try it with this video http://lachy.id.au/lib/media/elephantsdream/Elephants_Dream-720p-5.1.webm

[12:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
there's a stereo version of that available there too

[12:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How long is that video?

[12:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
about 10 minutes

[12:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
if you want to watch something longer, try http://lachy.id.au/lib/media/sitasingstheblues/Sita_Sings_the_Blues-360p-Stereo.webm

[12:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't have that in 720p yet

[12:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
and my experience with 1080p WebM wasn't great. The software decoding is too slow, at least for the encoding parameters I used at the time.

[12:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
There may be a way to make it more efficient, but I'm still trying to understand all the different parameters

[12:11:00.0000] <Rik`>
Lachy: the Opera Labs Mac version asks me to download your first video

[12:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hum, 10 minutes at 720p for 150 MB

[12:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Guess that's not so bad

[12:14:01.0000] <daedb>
Philip`: "In its HTML5 support, IE9 will support playback of H.264 video only." and "To be clear, users can install other codecs for use in Windows Media Player and Windows Media Center.  For web browsers, developers can continue to offer plug-ins (using NPAPI or ActiveX; they are effectively equivalent in this scenario) so that webpages can play video using these codecs on Windows." are about the most clear statements I've seen. Both are

[12:14:02.0000] <daedb>
 from the IE blog.

[12:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: How can you deduce that it is not bad from the file size?

[12:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could probably get that size with MJPEG with quality=5, but it wouldn't be not so bad

In its HTML5 support, IE9 will support playback of H.264 video as well as VP8 video when the user has installed a VP8 codec on Windows.

[12:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: I can deduce that it's not so bad from the fact that it doesn't have a much larger file size than similar h264 files I have

[12:22:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hm

[12:22:01.0000] <virtuelv>
that elephant's dream was choppy for me

[12:22:02.0000] <virtuelv>
then again, I have no hw acceleration

[12:22:03.0000] <virtuelv>
but what bothered me was that the video seemed to need deblocking

[12:23:00.0000] <virtuelv>
it appeared to have what I can best describe as low-quuality jpeg artifacts in some frames

[12:23:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(this doesn't reflect my experience with the videos on youtube

[12:51:00.0000] <erlehmann>
virtuelv, well, it will probably play theora with xiph components, won't it ?

I have a question about sandboxed iframes again

[16:31:00.0000] <roc>
if a sandboxed iframe has scripts disabled, any child non-sandboxed iframes would still have scripts enabled, right?

[16:31:01.0000] <roc>
as far as I can tell from the spec, that's true

[16:31:02.0000] <roc>
hmm, but that can't be right

[16:32:00.0000] <roc>
oh here we go

[16:32:01.0000] <roc>
"In addition, any browsing contexts nested within an iframe, either directly or indirectly, must have all the flags set on them as were set on the iframe's Document's browsing context when the iframe's Document was created."

Leave my sense of logic at the door eh? :) Sounds like a fun place to hang out.

[17:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
does anybody know if the WebM subset of Matroiska includes multitrack support? (for caption tracks, additional audio tracks, etc.)

[17:19:00.0000] <kinetik>
MikeSmith: http://www.webmproject.org/code/specs/container/

[17:19:01.0000] <kinetik>
MikeSmith: no captions.  you can include multiple tracks, but it's not clear how the non-default ones are supposed to be handled yet.

[17:19:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
"Initial WebM release does not support subtitles. 

[17:19:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
WHATWG / W3C RFC will release guidance on subtitles and other overlays in HTML5 <video> in the near future. WebM intends to follow that guidance."

[17:30:00.0000] <nessy>
interesting!

[17:31:00.0000] <nessy>
kinetik: but it would technically be trivial to include the subtitling functionality of Matroska into WebM, right?

[17:32:00.0000] <kinetik>
nessy: fairly simple, yes

[17:32:01.0000] <nessy>
got a lot of reading specs to do :)

[17:32:02.0000] <kinetik>
nessy: i think the main problem right now is that the matroska spec specifies three or four subtitle formats

[17:32:03.0000] <nessy>
and they only want one?

[17:32:04.0000] <kinetik>
ideally we'd want to support one, and that one being whatever is web friendly

[17:33:00.0000] <nessy>
I like the "we" in that sentence ;)

[17:34:00.0000] <f1lt3r>
lol

[17:34:01.0000] <nessy>
any mailing lists or stuff you'd recommend to join? where does the webm community hang out?

[17:34:02.0000] <kinetik>
nessy: http://www.webmproject.org/about/discuss/

[17:35:00.0000] <nessy>
thanks! (not actually that easy to find...)

[17:36:00.0000] <f1lt3r>
zcorpan_, where can i find out more about w3c subtitle work?

[17:40:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
https://groups.google.com/a/webmproject.org/group/webm-discuss/browse_thread/thread/21ec1286b09e5616#

[17:40:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
f1lt3r: i think the work being referred to was removed from the w3c copy of the spec

[17:40:02.0000] <f1lt3r>
ok

[17:40:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
f1lt3r: but there's http://whatwg.org/html5#websrt

[17:41:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
(the previous link was unrelated)

[17:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
kinetik: thanks for the info

[17:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and zcorpan_ 

[17:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
nessy, kinetik, the plan is for WebM to eventually support whatever format is specced for use in HTML5, which at this stage, is the WebSRT proposal.

[17:59:00.0000] <kinetik>
Lachy: that's my understanding too, but it's not clear from webmproject.org

[17:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
kinetik, I know cause I've been involved in the discussions for the past few weeks

[18:03:00.0000] <kinetik>
Lachy: on seaotter?

[18:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[18:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
"Overall, VP8 appears to be significantly weaker than H.264 compression-wise"

[18:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
who's Jason Garrett-Glaser?

[18:07:01.0000] <kinetik>
one of the lead x264 (an h.264 encoder) developers

[18:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK

[18:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

[18:24:00.0000] <karlcow>
MikeSmith, Lachy: Do you know if there are asian device makers who would be annoyed by vp8. thinking about samsung, nintendo and sony for example. Or do they use chipsets from elsewhere.

[18:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, I don't have any inside info on hardware vendors

[18:26:00.0000] <karlcow>
the list of people participating to the new webm consortium is missing some companies. Apple, Nokia, Samsung, Sony, it will be interesting to see how it evolves. Let's hope it doesn't turn into another war

[18:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
dunno know what any of those companies might think in regard to this news

[18:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and wouldn't want to speculate

[18:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and wouldn't say even if I did know anything :)

[18:37:00.0000] <karlcow>
hehe

[18:38:00.0000] <karlcow>
MikeSmith: I wouldn't hear what you would not have to say about it ;)

[18:43:00.0000] <wycats>
Hixie: from your perspective, what is the best way to ensure that forms post UTF-8 

[18:43:01.0000] <wycats>
the most reliable combination I can find is accept-charset, a hidden field with unicode character as value, and _charset_ to validate (if available)

[18:43:02.0000] <wycats>
is there anything else?

[18:43:03.0000] <wycats>
is this unreliable?

[18:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is the host document UTF-8?

[18:45:00.0000] <wycats>
Philip`: yes

[18:45:01.0000] <wycats>
Philip`: but the user can change it :/

[18:45:02.0000] <wycats>
it seems that accept-charset + hidden field with unicode value results in all browsers (including IE) ignoring user-overridden charsets

[18:46:00.0000] <wycats>
I'm asking here because there was a lot of discussion on back-compat in the WF2 days around this topic (from what I can glean)

[20:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if I were a tech reporter, I think right now I'd be asking for comments on WebM from some companies with serious business stakes in IPTV

[20:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://kynesim.blogspot.com/2010/04/interesting-times-for-ott-video.html is interesting

[20:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
"From a royalty regime point of view it's much more important to replace AC3 and MP3 with Vorbis than it is to replace HTML5 with Theora. Particularly since the MP3 licensors, in particular, are apt to charge punitive rates to implementations which take other formats too - this being one reason why IPTV broadcasts generally avoid mp3"

[20:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
mp3 patents should expire within a few years...

[20:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: so I'm sure the patent holders will do everything they can to make as much money as possible on them during those few remaining years

[20:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would if I were them

[21:06:00.0000] <nimbupani>
Would the companies not try to extend the life of the patent? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreening

[21:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me is not a patent law expert

[21:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: many of them are also patent holders on AAC and I expect they would not want to scare people off AAC by being dicks about <P3

[21:43:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
nimbupani: that's a depressing article

[21:43:01.0000] <nimbupani>
MikeSmithX: evergreening?

[21:43:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
one more among the list of things I guess I should know about but would almost rather not

[21:43:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
nimbupani: yeah

[21:44:00.0000] <nimbupani>
yeah thats how big pharmas make their money :(

[21:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, everybody's got a right to make money

[21:45:00.0000] <nimbupani>
indian companies making AIDS meds for 1/10th cost were sued out of existence coz of patent infringements

[21:45:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, that's definitely screwed up then

[21:45:02.0000] <nimbupani>
so big NGOs in Africa get grants to pay big pharmas LOTS of money to get these expensive meds and then give them for free for AIDS victims who are poor.

[21:45:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess it could be argued that they are still playing by the rules

[21:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and that it's the rules that need to change

[21:46:01.0000] <nimbupani>
MikeSmith: yes, exactly. 

[21:46:02.0000] <nimbupani>
this patent law is screwed I think.

[21:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm sure they use a good part of their profits to lobby against changing the rules

[21:48:00.0000] <nimbupani>
i think so too.

[21:49:00.0000] <nimbupani>
Plus US has all these Free Trade Agreements that let them sue companies in the countries they have FTAs with (for patent infringements)

[21:50:00.0000] <nimbupani>
the carrot in the case of Singapore was visa waiver for Singapore citizens and special H1B category for them, one of the things in return was stricter enforcement of anti-piracy practices (among others). 

[22:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
sounds more like extortion than a carrot

[22:03:00.0000] <nimbupani>
:) 

[02:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I downloaded the 64-bit Ubuntu WebM build of Opera, but it doesn't support WebM. How do I make sure the app doesn't load libs from the Opera installed from .deb and actually loads from the directory extracted from .tar.gz?

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
32-bit WebM-enabled MozillaDeveloperPreview on Mac, WFM, on the other hand

[02:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, foolip should know, if he's around

[02:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I will try the build now, see if it works for me

[02:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm still on Karmic, FWIW

[02:35:00.0000] <foolip>
hi there

[02:35:01.0000] <foolip>
there's a problem with the libc version linked in the Linux builds

[02:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hi

[02:36:00.0000] <foolip>
if you put those plugins in GST_PLUGIN_PATH and do gst-inspect opera_vp8, do you see some plugin load failed warnings?

[02:36:01.0000] <Creap>
with ARIA boolean values, does that mean I should have aria-haspopup=true, aria-haspopup=aria-haspopup or just aria-haspopup in html5?

[02:36:02.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, the build kind of works for me in Ubuntu.

[02:36:03.0000] <annevk>
Creap, I think ARIA is different from boolean attributes as defined in HTML

[02:37:00.0000] <annevk>
Creap, we gave Last Call comments to that effect

[02:37:01.0000] <foolip>
Karmic just might be too old, I built on Lucid

[02:37:02.0000] <annevk>
Creap, I lost track as to whether they were addressed or not

[02:37:03.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, but the audio seems to drop out after a few seconds, and comes back only after I seek.

[02:37:04.0000] <Creap>
ok

[02:37:05.0000] <foolip>
hsivonen: if that's the issue, then we know about it (too late) and are going to fix it

[02:38:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Creap: it should be =true according to the aria spec, iirc

[02:38:01.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: low bandwidth?

[02:38:02.0000] <Lachy>
no, playing from localhost

[02:38:03.0000] <Lachy>
well, sort of. Ubuntu running in a virtual machine is accessing the web server running under Mac on the same computer

[02:38:04.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: file a bug :) (not in #whatwg)

[02:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/726083

[02:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
will do soon

[02:39:02.0000] <foolip>
hsivonen: yeah, that's the same issue

[02:39:03.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: thanks

[02:39:04.0000] <foolip>
sorry about that, linux libraries were rushed

[02:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me looks forward to having WebM in mozilla-central and therefore in my local builds

[02:42:00.0000] <doublec>
hsivonen, the patches are in the bugs now. I'm just touching my stuff up for review

[02:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, maybe the audio issue is caused by VMWare trying to take a snapshot of the virtual machine, and using a lot of resources. I usually have to wait for that to finish before doing things

[02:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
doublec: great!

[02:53:00.0000] <annevk>
"I didn't patent CSS" heh

[02:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think it's great howcome made that point on stage.

[03:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, Håkon may not have, but Microsoft did :-)

[03:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
according to the CSS patent disclosures

[03:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
about http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=4926&to=4927 .. is that constraint meant to be machine checkable?

[03:11:01.0000] <annevk>
i think it is

[03:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
how can you detect "include data blocks"?

[03:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
how do I determine if an instance of the element contains data blocks?

[03:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I can imagine it for certain known mime types

[03:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but in general, the validator can't know what the browser would treat as script

[03:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
(what othermaciej said ... I type too clow)

[03:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not for sure anywa

[03:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
*slow

[03:13:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it can identify JavaScript and known non-script types and that's it

[03:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what's the current state of discussion around the Content Security Policy spec?

[03:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://people.mozilla.org/~bsterne/content-security-policy/

[03:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
have other browser vendors expressed some support for implementing it yet?

[03:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the WebKit project may be interested in implementing it

[03:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but

[03:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I dunno how good the current rev is

[03:17:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: i think html5 should specify a dedicated mime type for 'data blocks'

[03:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: aye

[03:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: OK, thanks

[03:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
no clear statement from vendors

[03:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I prefer security features that work more automatically w/ less work by the content author

[03:18:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but clearly the idea of dropping priveleges has a certain appeal right now

[03:18:05.0000] <othermaciej>
good night

[03:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
'night

[03:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
are the right people at Opera aware of the content type trouble with http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/1891/sunflower-webm.html ?

[03:24:00.0000] <roc>
Lachy: yesterday you said something about the performance of WebM decoding with the CPU on 1080p

[03:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(the video file is application/octet-stream; should be video/webm)

[03:25:00.0000] <hasather>
hsivonen: I can mail the guy

[03:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hasather: thanks

[03:26:00.0000] <annevk>
according to foolip application/octet-stream should play per the specification

[03:27:00.0000] <roc>
Lachy: Using GL to perform YUV conversion and scaling, we can play fullscreen 1080p using slightly less than one core of my 3-year-old Macbook pro , so it's definitely doable

[03:27:01.0000] <annevk>
specification is somewhat unclear on media types; e.g. if a UA supports Ogg Theora and WebM, someone puts WebM as video/ogg on the web, it should still play per spec

[03:27:02.0000] <roc>
which specification?

[03:27:03.0000] <annevk>
HTML5

[03:28:00.0000] <annevk>
"The MIME type "application/octet-stream" with no parameters is never a type that the user agent knows it cannot render."

[03:29:00.0000] <roc>
ah

[03:29:01.0000] <roc>
interesting, I wasn't aware of that

[03:29:02.0000] <annevk>
and fetching resources says

[03:29:03.0000] <annevk>
"If the media resource is found to have Content-Type metadata that, when parsed as a MIME type (including any codecs described by the codecs parameter), represents a type that the user agent knows it cannot render (even if the actual media data is in a supported format)"

[03:29:04.0000] <annevk>
it doesn't actually say anything about mismatching

[03:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: looks like the spec is settuing us up for image/* all over again

[03:30:01.0000] <annevk>
not sure whether to consider this broken or a feature

[03:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
right. magic numbers within image/* work

[03:30:03.0000] <hsivonen>
except for SVG maybe

[03:30:04.0000] <annevk>
yeah, SVG is noted as exception

[03:30:05.0000] <zcorpan_>
i noticed this about a year ago or so

[03:30:06.0000] <annevk>
for images

[03:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
don't remember if i emailed the list, but at least Hixie didn't think it was an obvious bug as to change the spec

[03:31:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, was there discussion about it too? I though there was

[03:31:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
at least in #whatwg, yeah

[03:32:00.0000] <roc>
hum

[03:32:01.0000] <roc>
when did this get added?

[03:32:02.0000] <roc>
adding a requirement for binary sniffing of all media types is a fairly big deal

[03:34:00.0000] <foolip>
that is what we're doing

[03:34:01.0000] <annevk>
I think we should remove that

[03:34:02.0000] <annevk>
I guess Apple advocated it

[03:34:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: about http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9707 .. the bug-status guidelines that othermaciej wrote up pretty much reserve the "invalid" state for bug reports that are simply spam. I think we are meant to use "worksforme" instead for cases like this one

[03:35:00.0000] <annevk>
but all this is based on vague recollections so don't take my word for it :)

[03:35:01.0000] <foolip>
I wouldn't mind changing the spec, but would make actually changeing the implemention veeery low priority

[03:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Why does http://videojs.com/ have a *fallback* for Opera?

[03:35:03.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan_: can you check it out?

[03:36:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
roc: at first there were no checking at all in the spec

[03:36:01.0000] <annevk>
it was added between april and august 2009

[03:36:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
roc: then some checks were added, mostly due to feedback from me iirc

[03:37:00.0000] <annevk>
/me goes to find the exact diff

[03:37:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
oh maybe you're discussing something else

[03:37:02.0000] <annevk>
foolip, wouldn't it be a trivial change?

[03:37:03.0000] <foolip>
annevk: not at all

[03:38:00.0000] <foolip>
once we hand off the media to the platform, it doesn't even have the MIME type, it uses only sniffing to set up the decoding pipeline

[03:38:01.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7977

[03:39:00.0000] <roc>
thanks anne

[03:39:01.0000] <annevk>
foolip, ah yeah, but the application/octet-stream one should be more doable

[03:40:00.0000] <foolip>
annevk: to just not support it?

[03:40:01.0000] <foolip>
/me hsan't looked at the bug

[03:40:02.0000] <foolip>
oh, simon's old bug

[03:41:00.0000] <foolip>
we already handle application/octet-stream as per spec

[03:41:01.0000] <roc>
that bug report is not very helpful

[03:42:00.0000] <annevk>
foolip, right, to not support it

[03:42:01.0000] <annevk>
roc, not really, no :/

[03:42:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: why would we want to not support application/octet-stream?

[03:43:00.0000] <foolip>
I'm beginning to think that MIME types are just silly

[03:43:01.0000] <foolip>
well, it's nice that things aren't served as text/plain I guess

[03:43:02.0000] <jgraham>
That seems to be a surprisingly common conclusion

[03:44:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, I could be convinced that we want to support lack of a Content-Type header everywhere, but then we should be consistent about it

[03:44:01.0000] <foolip>
bah, I'm not writing a manifesto for/against MIME today, life goes on

[03:44:02.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, e.g. <html manifest> does not support lack of a content type, neither does EventSource() iirc

[03:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
<video> is more like <img> though

[03:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me doesn't really care much either way

[03:47:00.0000] <annevk>
we might gain some more friends by getting rid of Content-Type :p

[03:50:00.0000] <roc>
hmmm

[03:50:01.0000] <hasather>
hsivonen: the video should work now

[03:50:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: i think there are more effective ways to gain friends :P

[03:50:03.0000] <roc>
I wonder how we handle unknown content-types for video right now

[03:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
what was the issue with http://videojs.com/ ?

[03:51:01.0000] <roc>
ah, I think we just fail

[03:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hasather: thanks

[03:52:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
i get a <video> there in opera

[03:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: opera isn't on the support list but on the fallback list

[03:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: problem with advertising, not code, then

[04:38:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh I found the wrong bug?

[04:38:01.0000] <annevk>
sorry

[04:39:00.0000] <annevk>
/me looks once more

[04:42:00.0000] <annevk>
the actual revision was http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=3497&to=3498

[04:42:01.0000] <annevk>
it is not tied back to any bug report or email unfortunately

[04:42:02.0000] <annevk>
though you could look in the archives of mailing lists to see if hixie confirmed such a change around 2009-07-30 

[04:47:00.0000] <annevk>
/me cannot find something in the whatwg archives so fast

[04:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: Do you mean http://article.gmane.org/gmane.ietf.http-wg/4340 ?

[04:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
(or the public-html equivalent)

[04:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which Google is less happy to find for me)

[05:00:00.0000] <annevk>
guess so

[06:12:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, awake by any chance?

[06:12:01.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, I was wondering if the split between display values is really intuitive enough for authors

[06:12:02.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, I think we should at least provide some simple shorthands for flex usage

[07:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ah, so it was mozilla guys asking for application/octet-stream

[07:25:00.0000] <annevk>
and now they wonder why lol

[07:25:01.0000] <annevk>
typical that only we ended up implementing it :p

[07:26:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i think the spec is fine as is, fwiw

[07:30:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, paving the path for getting rid of content negotiation and what not :p

[07:31:00.0000] <annevk>
on the other hand, it makes me wonder why we'd support media types on the HTTP level at all...

[07:31:01.0000] <annevk>
for video

[07:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
to make videos playable in top-level browsing context without sniffing everything for video

[07:34:00.0000] <annevk>
so in a top-level browsing context we'd not play video labeled as application/octet-stream?

[07:35:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
not sure

[07:35:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
but we wouldn't for text/plain or text/html

[08:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Awesome for legacy browsers like IE9 and Safari." :)

[09:04:00.0000] <paul_irish>
(sorry about the flood flood. eek)

[09:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: Hixie said websrt would be used for chapters also

[09:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
really?

[09:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
but it's not a chapter format

[09:24:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100504#l-77

[09:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: I'm up now.

[09:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
What were you thinking?

[11:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
what are the requirements for media chapters?

[11:52:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and what are the solutions being used today for media chapters?

[11:54:00.0000] <gour>
i'm reading diveintohtml5 and wonder if it is safe to use 'html' doctype and some similar html5 enhancements for a web site (which will be generated by static site generator)?

[11:55:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
depends on what you mean by 'safe'

[11:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The html doctype is completely safe; it's been usable for years.

[11:55:02.0000] <gour>
that's it will be useful for those users using old IE crap

[11:55:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Many of the simpler new elements can be used, but you have to use the html5 shim in IE, and apply proper styling to them yourself, as they're not officially recognized yet.

[11:56:00.0000] <paul_irish>
gour: yup. it'll kick it into standards mode, which means your css and js will act the exact same as if you had the xhtml1 or html4 strict doctype up there

[11:56:01.0000] <gour>
i plan to use YAML framework which takes care of (almost all) IE 'idioms'

[11:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Alternately, you may look at this page for valid html doctypes that will trigger standards mode in all browsers: http://www.xanthir.com/etc/doctype.php

[11:57:01.0000] <gour>
let me see...

[11:57:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
TabAtkins: they're not valid

[11:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan_: Really?  I discussed it here in the room, and thought it was valid a while back.

[11:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Did something change on me recently?

[11:58:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
they trigger standards mode

[11:58:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
they're not valid

[11:58:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, right.  Yes.

[11:58:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's fine.  ^_^

[11:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I will amend my statment in the future.  I didn't mean that sense of "valid".

[12:00:00.0000] <gour>
TabAtkins: http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/ is the place of html5 shiv?

[12:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[12:01:01.0000] <gour>
ta

[12:13:00.0000] <paul_irish>
<!dOcTYpE                HTMl   >  is valid though. :)

[12:13:01.0000] <paul_irish>
html5 doctype, myspace style.

[12:16:00.0000] <gour>
:-)

[12:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
msg paul_irish You work for g now, right?

[12:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Shit.

[12:23:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh.

[12:26:00.0000] <paul_irish>
:) I don't start for another 2 weeks or so.

[13:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me finishes /The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet/, wonders what he was planning to do 

[13:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
It's a fantastic book by the way

[13:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although possibly I feel too sad to do anything useful

[13:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
Finishing good books sucks

[14:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
(it is also possible that listening to the Eels isn't the most chhering way to recover)

[14:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
*cheering

[14:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
Leaving the xkcd book lying around is dangerous. Now my life is soundtracked by intermittent bursts of laughter mingled with the occasional "that is /so/ like you"

[14:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although I guess the fact that I am writing a monolouge about it on irc does provide some truth to the claims

[14:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
^_^

[16:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Both 89 and 92 have proposals on them now.


2010-05-21
[17:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: neat

[17:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: I'll record them later today

[17:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: you may also want to look a 103 and 107 in case you care

[17:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have no problem with 103, and nothing in particular to add to the 107 proposals.

[18:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is unclosed <del> supposed to affect the entire remaining document?

[18:59:00.0000] <rosh312>
has anyone had a/v syncing issues using ogg for html5 video?

[19:16:00.0000] <doublec>
rosh312, what browser?

[19:17:00.0000] <rosh312>
firefox

[19:17:01.0000] <doublec>
does the a/v sync look fine in another player?

[19:18:00.0000] <rosh312>
when i play it on vlc, it plays fine unless i try to seek

[19:18:01.0000] <doublec>
what happens then

[19:18:02.0000] <rosh312>
the video gets a little scrambled and the audio takes a second to sync back up

[19:18:03.0000] <doublec>
what version of firefox?

[19:18:04.0000] <rosh312>
i encoded it in ogg using firefogg directly from an m4v

[19:18:05.0000] <rosh312>
firefox 3.6

[19:19:00.0000] <doublec>
are you able to make the video publically available so I can try it?

[19:19:01.0000] <rosh312>
no, unfortunately not, it's for a company i'm working for that's still in private beta

[19:20:00.0000] <doublec>
if it goes out of sync in the first 20 seconds or so, is it possible to send that to me privately? (I'm a firefox developer working on the video support)

[19:21:00.0000] <rosh312>
sure, how can i send it to you?

[19:22:00.0000] <rosh312>
i can send you the whole video, i only meant i cant link you to the page where i have it playing using the video tag

[19:22:01.0000] <doublec>
how big is it?

[19:22:02.0000] <rosh312>
10mb

[19:23:00.0000] <doublec>
is there anywhere you can put it behind http authentication that I can get it from?

[19:23:01.0000] <doublec>
and then take it down when I've got it

[19:25:00.0000] <rosh312>
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45844/mergefm.ogv

[19:25:01.0000] <rosh312>
does that work?

[19:27:00.0000] <doublec>
ok, dling now

[19:29:00.0000] <doublec>
rosh312, got it

[19:30:00.0000] <rosh312>
great, score one for dropbox

[19:34:00.0000] <boblet>
hey all. what’s the HTML5 way of adding <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="chrome=1" />? Is it just something that hasn’t yet been registered on the Wiki PragmaExtensions page as per 4.2.5.4?

[19:36:00.0000] <boblet>
Also I’m assuming this could be added via the server header X-UA-Compatible: chrome=1 — anyone know if that validates?

[19:46:00.0000] <boblet>
looks like it does, according to http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22708

[19:55:00.0000] <boblet>
any thoughts on whether nested links will make it into a future version of HTML?

[19:55:01.0000] <rosh312>
turns out the issue was the flash object playing at least the audio underneath the html5 video

[19:55:02.0000] <rosh312>
the firefox bug report is here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=487398

[19:56:00.0000] <rosh312>
thanks again doublec

[19:56:01.0000] <doublec>
you're welcome rosh312!

[20:01:00.0000] <boblet>
did Eric Meyer ever submit his nested linking proposal: http://meyerweb.com/eric/html-xhtml/html5-linking.html

[20:01:01.0000] <boblet>
can’t find discussion of it in list archives

[20:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
does anybody happen to know where in the MathML 2.0 spec it defines what a number is?

[21:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/chapter2.html#id.2.1.5.1

[23:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/chapter3.html#id.3.3.4.2.5

[23:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
just discovering "negativeveryverythinmathspace"

[23:44:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
et al

[23:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
beautiful

[00:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: when you have time, I wanted to ask about updating the v.nu MathML schema

[00:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see that MathML 3.0 is now at CR

[00:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and that the spec includes an RNC schema

[00:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so...

[00:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe it'd make sense to replace the current v.nu MathML 2.0 schema with that one

[00:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and of course note in the UI that it's now doing MathML 3.0 validation

[00:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
after looking through the current (2.0) schema, I suspect there might be quite a few bugs in it

I fixed a few today, but based on that sample, I reckon there are probably more waiting to be found

[01:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and it seems like that schema has not had any maintenance in a very long time

[01:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
upstream, I mean

[01:03:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://yupotan.sppd.ne.jp/relax-ng/mml2.html shows the last update was two years ago

[01:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: Does MathML 3.0 have any UA support?

[01:05:00.0000] <jgraham>
It sems dangerous to validate something that doesn't actually work in browsers

[01:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, true

[01:05:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what is new in MML 3.0

[01:05:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I just don't relish the prospect of making further updates to this old and buggy 2.0 schema we currently have

[01:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/appendixf.html#changes.mathml2.0e-3.0

[01:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
(if you've not found it already)

[01:49:00.0000] <annevk>
so what do the i18n guys want?

[01:49:01.0000] <annevk>
that we ignore all content-language for :lang() processing?

[01:49:02.0000] <annevk>
would simplify some code, for sure...

[01:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: the more they say what they want, the less I understand

[02:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me wonders which profile of h.264 was used in http://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=67266&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+StreamingMediaMagazine-FeaturedArticles+%28StreamingMedia.com%3A+Featured+Articles%29

[02:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
"MainConcept H.264" - is that the "Main" profile?

[02:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
no, that's the vendor

[02:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
of the codec

[02:16:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[02:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
they didn't specify the profile and they didn't use what is probably the best H.264 encoder available (x264)

[02:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(profile or other encoder parameters)

[02:18:00.0000] <annevk>
wow, bunch of crap added to that URL...

[02:18:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
feeds--

[02:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
according to the internets, MainConcept is apparently a fairly poor H.264 encoder

[02:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
though it does come bundled w/ a bunch of other tools

[02:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if anybody on the channel has HTML+MathML content to test with, please run it through http://qa-dev.w3.org:8888/ (unstable instance of validator.nu backend) when you have some time.. I made some change that could have introduced regressions

"Total execution time 79 milliseconds."

[02:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
v.nu is fast

[02:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what does it require 79ms to do?

[02:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
validate the page against relaxng schema, check datatype restrictions on attribute values, maybe run some other checks (depending on the content)

[02:41:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
also schematron and checks written in java

[02:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
not bad for Java

[02:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is a relatively simple page, though

[02:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I think it might do some caching, but not sure

[02:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's definitely faster the 2+ time you check the same page

[02:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
uses Jetty, btw

[02:44:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
i think it was something on 300 ms first time

[02:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Safari takes about 25ms to parse and render it (cached), but to be fair we're not rendering the MathML (yet)

http://twitter.com/mpt/status/11106684817 interesting axiom

[04:43:01.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if it applies to specification development

[04:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, it's only a useful axiom to the extent "best use" of developer time is useful

[04:46:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
so what extension to use for webm audio? wma? :)

[04:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
Developers exist to help users make best use of their time

[04:46:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't it .webm?

[04:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
so bug trackers are really for users

[04:47:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
yes but it's being discussed that webm video and webm audio should have different extensions

[04:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
.webm is a hacky compromise to make video work reliably, I don't think we should be forcing it into the less messy area of audio

[04:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not sure what disagrees with mpt's principle

[04:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
(or rather. why he decided to formulte it)

[04:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you don't believe in Philip`'s axiom

[04:50:01.0000] <kinetik>
Dashiva: it's hacky?

[04:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Shouldn't WebM audio be .oga?

[04:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: If it's in an ogg container, yes

[04:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
Shouldn't it be in an Ogg container?

[04:51:03.0000] <kinetik>
Philip`: that requires someone to implement ogg demuxing

[04:51:04.0000] <Philip`>
You don't lose much functionality, and you gain compatibility with the rest of the world

[04:51:05.0000] <Dashiva>
kinetik: An arbitrary not-fully-compatible subset of matroska, limited to only one codec, hacky

[04:52:00.0000] <kinetik>
Philip`: you miss out on having an index for seeking

[04:53:00.0000] <kinetik>
Dashiva: two codecs.  and it's compatible bar the doctype.

[04:53:01.0000] <Dashiva>
If it's not fully compatible, it's not compatible

[04:53:02.0000] <kinetik>
why does it need to be compatible?

[04:53:03.0000] <Philip`>
kinetik: That's not much functionality

[04:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
(since it's not like it's impossible to seek in Ogg files)

[04:54:01.0000] <kinetik>
it's also not very fast.

[04:54:02.0000] <kinetik>
over high latency connections like... the internet.

[04:55:00.0000] <daedb>
Isn't Webm with only audio basically just a slightly different .mka file?

[04:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes

[04:57:00.0000] <erlehmann>
webm audio ?

[04:57:01.0000] <erlehmann>
so no ogg vorbis but instead mkv + vorbis ?

[04:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, basically

[04:58:01.0000] <erlehmann>
sounds … unnecessarily complicated.

[04:58:02.0000] <daedb>
/me fails to see the point in using Webm for only audio when Ogg already exists and works

[04:58:03.0000] <Dashiva>
If webm had been a compatible subset of matroska, it could just have been .mka

[04:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
daedb: It seems silly to use Ogg for audio and WebM for video and audio.

[04:59:01.0000] <kinetik>
daedb: if someone implements webm and nothing else, it would be useful to be able to play audio only files with it.

[04:59:02.0000] <erlehmann>
i am confused. can one of the google engineers chime in ?

[05:00:00.0000] <kinetik>
daedb: for example, it sounds like flash will support webm, but it's not going to support ogg.

[05:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
kinetik: That's not confirmed. Flash will support VP8, nothing more has been said.

[05:00:02.0000] <kinetik>
gsnedders: "it sounds like"

[05:00:03.0000] <erlehmann>
why couldn't they just use an ogg container for webm ? i thought it was more streaming-friendly.

[05:01:00.0000] <kinetik>
gsnedders: also, look at this URL: http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplatform/2010/05/adobe_support_for_webm.html

[05:01:01.0000] <kinetik>
(note that they later reposted the same article as adobe_support_for_vp8.html though)

[05:01:02.0000] <kinetik>
erlehmann: it's not really any better or worse.

[05:02:00.0000] <erlehmann>
kinetik, well, ogg software and content is already out there. so from at least one point, it actually is worse.

[05:03:00.0000] <kinetik>
erlehmann: i was replying to "more streaming-friendly", but matroska software and content already exists too.

[05:03:01.0000] <erlehmann>
take oggforward for example. how do i do that with mkv again ? ;)

[05:03:02.0000] <kinetik>
and it's trivial to modify that to support webm.

[05:03:03.0000] <erlehmann>
of course.

[05:03:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me already has a page using <audio> with .ogg+.mp3 files, and would just prefer not to have to add a third source for no overwhelmingly compelling reason

[05:04:00.0000] <erlehmann>
mkv content is out there, harr harr. on p2p :D

[05:04:01.0000] <erlehmann>
Philip`, doesn't every browser having WebM support ogg, vorbis and theora already ?

[05:04:02.0000] <daedb>
kinetik: Well if they implement Vorbis then they should implement Ogg too, since that's the de facto standard container for Vorbis and it's already widely implemented.

[05:04:03.0000] <kinetik>
daedb: why?

[05:04:04.0000] <kinetik>
daedb: that's more work for little benefit.

[05:05:00.0000] <erlehmann>
daedb, i challenge your assumptions and replace them with my own.

[05:06:00.0000] <Rik`>
and what about supporting both ?

[05:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
kinetik: It seems a relatively significant benefit for users who already some Ogg Vorbis music files and want to just stick them on their web site without having to find special conversion tools

[05:07:00.0000] <erlehmann>
what Philip`said.

[05:07:01.0000] <daedb>
kinetik: Why should I have to change all my Ogg Vorbis files to a new altered version of mka (that doesn't work on my existing software that only supports standard mka) just to serve them on a web site?

[05:07:02.0000] <erlehmann>
also, vorbis has been a successful standard for years.

[05:07:03.0000] <daedb>
Author laziness > implementor laziness, basically

[05:12:00.0000] <kinetik>
Philip`: it'd be useful to those users, however many of them there are.

[05:12:01.0000] <kinetik>
there might not be enough to convince an implementor of webm to also implement ogg.

[05:32:00.0000] <annevk>
audio/webm should prolly be tied to .webma or something like that

[05:32:01.0000] <annevk>
or .weba

[05:35:00.0000] <erlehmann>
so much stuff to sort out. i wonder if it will take half a year or longer till webm is there.

[05:35:01.0000] <erlehmann>
for sufficiently usable values of "there"

[05:37:00.0000] <virtuelv>
what does the m in webm mean?

[05:38:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
virtuelv: i think webm stands for 'web media'

[05:41:00.0000] <erlehmann>
webm is a crappy name. they should have called it rincewind or voldemort.

[05:41:01.0000] <erlehmann>
:D

[05:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
webm is a crappy name but those are wosr :p

[05:41:03.0000] <jgraham>
*worse

[05:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
does the name mean I can't use it for video content that's not in the Web?

[05:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
H.264 is clearly a much cooler name

[05:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
and not at all hard to remember or to punctuate correctly

[05:44:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
they should have just called it 'chrome'

[05:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Since everything nowadays is on the web, they should have dropped the "web" and just called it "media"

[05:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
They should have called it iVideo

[05:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
To annoy apple

[05:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
They could have claimed the i stood for internet

[05:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
What does Apple claim the i stands for?

[05:47:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it's just there for coolness

[05:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
I believe they claim it stads for "try prefixing your product name with this and we will send an army of hungry lawyers"

[05:47:02.0000] <daedb>
"Apple declared the 'i' in iMac to stand for "Internet"; it also represented the product's focus as a personal device ('i' for "individual")." <-- from Wikipedia's Imac article

[05:48:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
they should have called it media5

[05:50:00.0000] <daedb>
Yeah, then we could've had .m5v and .m5a, which is obviously way better than those lousy .m4v/.m4a MPEG-4 files :D

[05:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
indeed!

[05:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
They should have renamed VP8 so you could watch Web Codec videos in Web Media files in your Web browser, in a Web application that uses Web Sockets in a Web Worker to save the video into Web Storage

[05:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also, it should be a Spiderman video

[06:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Lots of companies besides Apple have prefixed their product names with an 'i', like iPlayer for instance.

[06:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
they have in some cases sent in the lawyers, but I vaguely recall one where the result was basically that Apple doesn't own the 'i' prefix, and can't stop others using it.

[06:10:00.0000] <daedb>
iNaming still sucks though, and Apple started that awful trend.

[06:11:00.0000] <roc>
iiW

[06:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[06:11:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
we should start using the dotless "i"

[06:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me tries to figure out how to type dotless i

[06:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
I

[06:21:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
so Web Codec would be shortened to WC

[06:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
wc-1 wouldn't be confused with vc-1 at all

[06:31:00.0000] <erlehmann>
zcorpan_, world wide web codec ! video/w3c :P

[06:33:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
erlehmann: awesome

[06:34:00.0000] <erlehmann>
sadly, google has not paid attention to imaginative people like us

[06:35:00.0000] <roc>
we had some good name ideas

[06:35:01.0000] <roc>
H.266

[06:36:00.0000] <roc>
Ogg Shikari

[06:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
H.264zilla

[06:42:01.0000] <jcranmer>
... Ogg Shikari ...

[06:54:00.0000] <erlehmann>
roc, h.666 then mozilla could claim to not support it because its the number of evil

/me desires a bluffers guide to document.write

[08:59:00.0000] <virtuelv>
jgraham: and I want a time machine where I can go back and smack whoever thought up document.write

[09:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
virtuelv: Yeah, well we all want that

[09:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
Although I guess you don't need a time machine just to smak them, only to prevent them

[09:10:02.0000] <virtuelv>
barring that, I just wish I could get google/doubleclick to stop using it

[09:11:00.0000] <virtuelv>
jgraham: the smacking was more to discourage other similar ideas that would pop up

[10:06:00.0000] <theMadness>
Heh, google wasted a wonderful chance for <canvas> today.

[10:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, it would be unjust to prevent IE users from being able to play Pacman.

[10:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm just glad it isn't Flash.

[10:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Damn ghosts run faster than pac!

[10:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So, it looks like the VP8 announcement was fairly close to the best that could be expected.

[10:21:00.0000] <theMadness>
TabAtkins, only when you're turning or eating pellets, when you're running around normally you're faster. Also, try the insert coin button and do it while controlling ms pacman too (wasd) for extra nerd points. :D

[10:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
theMadness: Nah, Pinky is faster than you in a straightaway.

[10:22:00.0000] <theMadness>
I don't remember the single ghosts features tbh.

[10:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't remember them either; that was experimentally determined.

[10:23:01.0000] <theMadness>
Apparently they reverse engineered it and found out that pinky is in fact fast.

[19:06:00.0000] <sid_>
Hi I wanted to know is there a simple JS method to convert HTML body node to plain string WITHOUT STRIPPING THE HTML TAGS?

[19:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
.innerHTML?

[19:07:00.0000] <sid_>
nono thats without the tags.

[19:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Without which tags?  

[19:08:00.0000] <sid_>
never mind

[19:08:01.0000] <sid_>
thanks

[19:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
.outerHTML includes the <body> tags, but it's not supported everywhere.

[19:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But it's part of the spec, and it's part of IE, so it should be fine to use relatively soon

[19:09:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[19:12:00.0000] <sid_>
It is supported on chrome..

[19:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is there a version of caniuse that addresses the oldest browsers still with a relevant market share, I wonder

[19:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(That is, it doesn't help to know that IE9 supports feature X if IE<9 doesn't and still has a 40% market share)

[19:27:00.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: it depends on your site’s browser breakdown, but at the top of www.caniuse.com under “other options” there’s “show conclusions”…

[19:28:00.0000] <boblet>
basically that’s the same as “if there’s red, don’t use”

[20:25:00.0000] <boblet>
ooh this is nice: http://www.germanforblack.com/articles/moving-towards-readable-w3c-specs

[03:10:00.0000] <micheil>
Hixie: can we introduce a websocket-version header, as chrome implements draft75, yet chromium implements draft76+

[03:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
micheil: versioning means you either are lying or end up with multiple implementations/forks within an implementation, which seems bad. I'd rather just people didn't rely upon a non-final protocol that much :P

[04:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
micheil: just drop chrome support

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
micheil: anyway a new header ain't gonna do you any good for supporting already-implemented handshakes :-)

[04:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
and you can distinguish the handshakes unambiguously already if for some reason you really need to support obsolete experimental implementations

[04:17:01.0000] <micheil>
yeah, I've since relieased that only draft76+ sends sec-* headers

[04:26:00.0000] <micheil>
so, theoretically, I can have a dynamic switching mode to change between 75 and 76 on a per-client basis

[05:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, a pure ECMAScript templating engine...

[05:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess I really need some sort of tree model first.

[05:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, what would be a good tree model API in ECMAScript...

[05:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess I good approach would be to take the if-in-any-doubt-go-against-DOM approach

[05:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Represent the tree as an array of triples

[05:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: How so?

[05:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: [[1, "parent", 2], [1, "parent", 3], [1, "name", "html"], [2, "child", 1], [3, "child", 1], ...]

[05:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ah, like that

[05:30:02.0000] <Philip`>
Then you won't even be limited to tree structures

[05:30:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: :)

[05:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: That doesn't address the what's a good API question, unless you intend to just expose the raw data structure

[05:31:01.0000] <fantasai>
Hixie: I can't find a spec for the <meta http-equiv="Link"/> behavior required by http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/css/cascade/import/002.html

[05:31:02.0000] <fantasai>
Hixie: don't know what you want to do about it, but thought I'd mention...

[05:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
fantasai: Per HTML5 <meta http-equiv="Link"/> should have no effect

[05:32:01.0000] <fantasai>
gsnedders: The test passes in both Mozilla and Opera

[05:33:00.0000] <fantasai>
gsnedders: If it's intended to have no effect, the HTML5 spec should clarify

[05:33:01.0000] <fantasai>
gsnedders: I didn't find any discussion of it on the lists.

[05:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
fantasai: It's specified by a whitelist of http header names

[05:33:03.0000] <annevk>
you could raise it on whatwg⊙wo

[05:33:04.0000] <fantasai>
gsnedders: That doesn't change the fact that it looks like the issue was never considered.

[05:34:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah indeed, same for http-equiv=set-cookie

[05:34:01.0000] <annevk>
(which I raised some time ago)

[05:34:02.0000] <gsnedders>
fantasai: I don't think the stylesheet case was, but well, yeah, it seems like it may be worthwhile raising

[05:35:00.0000] <fantasai>
annevk: Should I post to whatwg, public-html, or both?

[05:36:00.0000] <fantasai>
/me doesn't know what the conventions are for deciding, now that her messages get through to both

[05:36:01.0000] <fantasai>
/me only had one option before

[05:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess that depends on whether you want no discussion then a reply in six months saying "ok, I changed the spec"/"I'm not going to change the spec", or whether you want a repeat of all the previous discussions about how the http-equiv value space is meant to be defined by HTTP not HTML

[05:42:00.0000] <asmodai>
mmm, anyone saw the Android 2.2 Froyo webbrowser JavaScript performance demo?

[05:49:00.0000] <fantasai>
Philip`: So what's the convention when you don't care and just want to file the issue and leave?

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
fantasai: The WHATWG list is probably simplest, but it doesn't really make that much difference

[05:58:00.0000] <annevk>
filing a bug might be even simpler in that scenario

[05:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Also there's no guaranteed response to posts on public-html, so you'd have to use the Bugzilla instead)

[06:06:00.0000] <fantasai>
annevk: Ok, filed http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/post_bug.cgi

[06:06:01.0000] <fantasai>
er

[06:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I thought you were working on Anolis 2 :p

[06:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Um, well...

[06:10:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I got distracted.

[06:10:03.0000] <jgraham>
Also, I vaugely considered writing a js templating engine a bit like genshi

[06:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
but without all the xml crap

[06:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Doing it for the pure ES case will be more fun though

[06:11:02.0000] <jgraham>
What do you mean "pure es"?

[06:11:03.0000] <jgraham>
The template itself would be executable javascript?

[06:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Something that will run in a shell, without all the host objects browsers have

[06:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I.e., for this case, no XML/HTML parser, no tree model..

[06:12:02.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah that was part of my design goals (given an API for reading files and so on)

[06:12:03.0000] <gsnedders>
It'll be a lot of work

[06:12:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Given that :(

[06:12:05.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, writing the template parser was the first part of the project

[06:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
html5lib for ES?

[06:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
basically I figured if you made it like XML but with much less syntax it wouldn't be that bad

[06:13:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I want to be able to take arbitrary HTML input, so I don't have it so easy

[06:13:03.0000] <jgraham>
more like XML - doctypes 

[06:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Why?

[06:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Because creating another language is stupid

[06:14:02.0000] <jgraham>
Not if it makes it achievable rather than impossible

[06:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway it is a pure subset of XML 1.0

[06:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
so it's not really new

[06:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me does wonder what perf would be like of a HTML5 parser in ES

[06:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
You can always use hsivonen's GWT one :)

[06:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Because all ES engine QAs love GWT, right? :)

[06:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, well if you have a project "make a templating engine" and stage one is "write a html5 parser", it is likely that you will never get past stage one

[06:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if anyone has used pylons

[06:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
(in particular I have a trivial pylons + genshi project where I am trying to pass a variable to the template doing something like c.a = "b" in the controller. However c in the template always seems to have no properties)

[06:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for zcorpan and all his dammed script states

[06:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is still bitter about that

[06:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
*damned

[06:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I don't remember seeing anything weird when I tried Pylons before

[06:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wants to vary the layout of a blog at thereshouldbenored.com based upon browser bugs, but needs ideas for bugs

[06:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: With genshi?

[06:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: yeah

[06:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
How long ago? There seems to be a relatively new pylons and a relatively new genshi

[06:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
A year or so?

[06:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm

[06:32:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I think it was just before I started at Opera, in the two weeks between my final exam and leaving for Sweden

[06:32:04.0000] <jgraham>
I remember using pylons for something one and it working

[06:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
So it shouldn't be impossible

[06:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone tried out BESEN?

[06:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm, seems to work now. No idea what I changed apart from trying to log what was happening, of course...

[06:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I take it you don't mean the New York based investment firm, so you might need to give more of a hint

[06:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
(or indeed the 

[06:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
http://besen.sourceforge.net/

[06:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
per the thread on es5-discuss (or maybe es-discuss), currently the only ES engine claiming full ES5 compliance

[06:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Given how well it does on Google, I would suggest that no one has tried it (approximatley)

[06:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Would be fun to use it to try out something using strict mode

[07:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Gah. The ES spec is somewhat ridiculous.

[07:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/foobar/x is a valid syntaxual extension, new RegExp("foobar", "x") must throw SyntaxError

[07:21:00.0000] <micheil>
gsnedders: do you think it's wise for a server to support dynamic & automated switching between websocket versions?

[07:21:01.0000] <micheil>
so, allow the server to be told to use either draft75 or draft76, or auto

[07:21:02.0000] <gsnedders>
micheil: I'd say you run the risk of clients never moving to a newer version of the 

[07:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
spec and being stuck having to support it forever

[07:22:00.0000] <micheil>
well, the code to support the old one isn't much

[07:22:01.0000] <micheil>
just a different handshake

[07:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
substr is non-standard!?

[07:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
In the lovely app. B

[07:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Everyone loves ECMAScript

[07:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: Versioning is bad in the long run. WebSockets is just a bit unstable right now

[07:42:01.0000] <micheil>
jgraham: yeah, although, right now, chromium supports draft76+

[07:43:00.0000] <micheil>
and chrome does draft75

[07:43:01.0000] <micheil>
making it utter hell for developers wanting to use them

[07:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I'm proving how long its been sice I read the spec to be amazed a this

[07:44:00.0000] <micheil>
so what I'm thinking of doing is adding in an automatic upgrade/downgrade to draft75 or 76, unless the server is told to run explicitly on draft76 only.

[07:44:01.0000] <annevk>
micheil, well a) it's still experimental and b) the request is different so it should be as much hell as it would be with versioning

[07:44:02.0000] <micheil>
annevk: that's what I mean, so, I can check if the sec-* headers are sent, if they are, we assume that it's > 75

[07:45:00.0000] <micheil>
otherwise, we assume it's 75.

[07:45:01.0000] <micheil>
(sorta like esmtp vs smtp)

[07:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: Yeah if you need o deploy right now, that will work

[07:46:01.0000] <micheil>
so, yeah

[07:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
But I would just support 76 and ignore 75; it will disappear soon enough

[07:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
76 might disappear too...

[07:47:01.0000] <jgraham>
(I mean there is a push to change handshake yet again)

[07:47:02.0000] <jgraham>
(or two different pushes, really)

[07:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess having multiple different constructors for the various tokens is going to be suboptimal, because it'd mean using isinstance, which is (relatively) slow

[07:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Just give each token an id

[07:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
+type

[07:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, that's what I was going to do

[07:51:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: What are you actually doing now?

[07:51:04.0000] <gsnedders>
html5lib for ES ;P

[07:52:00.0000] <micheil>
jgraham: you're kidding me.. ?

[07:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: No

[07:52:02.0000] <micheil>
heh heh.

[07:52:03.0000] <micheil>
is there any information on these two pushes?

[07:52:04.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Ah, I hope phase two wasn't that significant then :p

[07:52:05.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: Sure, on the hybi mailing list

[07:52:06.0000] <micheil>
hmm..

[07:52:07.0000] <micheil>
there's archives yes?

[07:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I could be evil and have something like function EOFToken() { var t = new Token(); token.type = EOFToken; return token; }

[07:53:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Yes you could

[07:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
But that would just be odd

[07:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Also, why are both of us sitting around indoors on IRC when it's a nice sunny day?

[07:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me keeps wondering why he is, then fails to come up with a better plan of what to do :P

[07:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: Basically some people think the handshake will confuse (that is, be hard to implement in) some mixed HTTP/WebSockets servers and some people think that the handshake should be done in TLS instead

[07:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
for security reasons

[07:55:02.0000] <micheil>
oh man.

[07:55:03.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah

[07:55:04.0000] <micheil>
if you require TLS you'd be adding a barrier.

[07:55:05.0000] <jgraham>
Indeed

[07:55:06.0000] <micheil>
the current awesome thing about websockets is that anyone can start a server for it

[07:55:07.0000] <gsnedders>
switch uses non-strict equality, right?

[07:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
The argument goes "everyone will just use libraries to do TLS"

[07:56:01.0000] <micheil>
and, thanks, but the new websocket draft76 handshake isn't hard to implement in the server level

[07:56:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I think, but you aren't going to depend on that, right? :)

[07:56:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: It just makes it unusable for my case :)

[07:57:00.0000] <micheil>
yes, it required a small change to how we handled requests in node, but overall, the only difficulty is the implementation of the security headers

[07:57:01.0000] <micheil>
because of the various datatypes it uses

[07:57:02.0000] <micheil>
it's hard to implement, but not impossible / extremely hard

[07:57:03.0000] <micheil>
it just means a little more code.

[07:57:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: (I have a charsMask function that returns false at EOF, otherwise whatever does or does not match the mask, possibly "")

[07:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I don't buy the libraries argument myself; it is barely possible in the python stdlib and the puported third party alternatives are not that well known for being simple)

[07:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
(and the python stdlib is unusually good)

[08:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: If you think this would be a serious impediment to you I think you should say so on the list

[08:01:00.0000] <micheil>
jgraham: I'm not a technical person, I'm just a protocol implementor

[08:01:01.0000] <micheil>
although, really, the current spec looks rather good

[08:01:02.0000] <micheil>
(I have had code having it work, in plain JS, it was a bit difficult, but really, most other languages have better datatypes then js)

[08:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that http://philip.html5.org/tools/parser/ exists as an HTML5 parser in JS, albeit rather incompletely and buggy and inefficient

[08:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I'm also tempted doing this to follow hsivonen's example and make it a DFA, never rewinding the data stream

[08:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: and ld

[08:02:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*old

[08:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Age is unimportant

[08:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Incompleteness and bugginess and inefficiency may be important, though)

[08:03:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Wait, that's created from the OCaml impl, right?

[08:03:03.0000] <Philip`>
The _auto.js files are

[08:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: In this case age directly implies "buggy" though

[08:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
Unless your original bugs happened to exactly match the subsequent spec changes

[08:04:02.0000] <jgraham>
Which would be impressive

[08:04:03.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Not directly - age plus spec changes implies buggy

[08:04:04.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah but we know apriori that spec changed has occurred

[08:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Someone ought to update the Python impl to match the spec

[08:05:01.0000] <jgraham>
I have made some changes

[08:05:02.0000] <gsnedders>
And the PHP one too

[08:05:03.0000] <jgraham>
Locally

[08:05:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Also, did you win?

[08:05:05.0000] <jgraham>
I was going to bring back the python 3 implementation this weekend but I'm not sure I will get around to it now

[08:05:06.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: hahahaha

[08:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(I'm expecting not.)

[08:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(I guess laughter confirms that.)

[08:10:00.0000] <micheil>
hmm.. are all the messages in the mailing list about websockets pretty much from that Simon from opera?

[08:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Most discussion nowadays is about the protocol which is mainly on the HyBi list

[08:11:00.0000] <micheil>
HyBi list?

[08:12:00.0000] <micheil>
I'm looking at: http://www.whatwg.org/mailing-list

[08:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/hybi

[08:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
Notice http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg01948.html

[08:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
and http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/hybi/current/msg02003.html

[08:20:00.0000] <micheil>
right, well, for one, ssl will kill websockets, as ssl is fairly difficult to implement (in a good way)

[08:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notices where Motala is again, seeming he always forgets

[08:20:02.0000] <micheil>
I still have no idea whether node.js even supports ssl, which is where I'm seeing a large increase in interest of websockets

[08:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think there's plenty of interest not related to node.js

[08:22:00.0000] <micheil>
true, although, yeah

[08:23:00.0000] <micheil>
my point still standards, SSL is fairly heavy stuff; and as for implementing, well, what is it, openssl or gnutls?

[08:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
But I agree "just use sockets" and "just use twisted" (to reuse othermaciej's python example) are rather different uses of the word "just"

[08:24:00.0000] <micheil>
and, I like the idea of having wss and ws, they server a good purpose.

[08:25:00.0000] <micheil>
although, I don't really have any legs to stand on as far as technical chops; I can just read specs and implement them (hopefully).

[08:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So, uh, anolis 2.

[08:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: You seem ideally placed to answer questions like "is X too big a barrier for typical server developers"

[08:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
(of course it may be that the security argument wins over convenience, in which case we jsut have to suck up the fact that therewill be far less diversity of implemntation)

[08:38:00.0000] <micheil>
yeah

[08:41:00.0000] <micheil>
jgraham: I guess the other thing to note, is if you want some super strength security on your websockets, then we've already got wss

[08:42:00.0000] <micheil>
which is, afaik, much like https

[08:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think the point is not to protect the data being transmitted, but to protect non-websockets servers

[08:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
So optional wss doesn't help

[08:45:00.0000] <micheil>
I'm confused there, tbh.

[08:45:01.0000] <micheil>
a normal server should not be handling an upgrade request like an ordinary http request, should it?

[08:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
A normal server could be anything, not just http

[08:47:00.0000] <micheil>
okay, non-websocket server then

[08:47:01.0000] <micheil>
a non-websocket server just simply doesn't respond to a websocket upgrade request

[08:47:02.0000] <jgraham>
Say you could construct the websocket handshake in just such a way that a smtp server (for example) would see a commnt (smtp probably doesn't have comments but let's pretend)

[08:47:03.0000] <jgraham>
and then once you were connected, you would start sending smtp

[08:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
that would be bad

[08:48:01.0000] <micheil>
(that's odd, I actually know a fair bit of the smtp protocol, I was implementing that for node.js as well)

[08:48:02.0000] <jgraham>
I know roughly nothing about smtp

[08:48:03.0000] <micheil>
so, what, you mean connecting to a server, then faking a connection, like connecting via telnet

[08:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: s/ about.*//

[08:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: That is true of everyone though and is therefore a less interesting observation

[08:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: Yes

[08:50:00.0000] <micheil>
right, but that's an attack vector in.. well, pretty much every protocol, isn't it?

[08:50:01.0000] <micheil>
I mean, even if you do requrie tls / ssl connections, you can still do it.

[08:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me decides to try out geotagging photos from tracks recorded on his phone

[08:50:03.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: I'm not an expert

[08:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
But yes it applies to more than just websockets

[08:51:01.0000] <micheil>
well, of the protocols I've seen, most are somewhat malleable through telnet or ssl telnet

[08:51:02.0000] <micheil>
so, by saying that websockets requires more then any other protocol seems rather odd to me.

[08:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
It's the other way around; you shouldn't be able to talk some other protocol using websockets

[08:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
just like you can't talk smtp by carefully constructing http requests

[08:52:02.0000] <micheil>
although, we have to remember that websockets are an extension to http.

[08:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
(so websockets shouldn't be like telnet which does allow you to talk random other protocols)

[08:53:01.0000] <micheil>
unless of course you make them not an extension on http

[08:53:02.0000] <jgraham>
They are not really an exension of HTTP

[08:53:03.0000] <micheil>
at the same instance, a websocket client probably couldn't talk to smtp

[08:54:00.0000] <micheil>
jgraham: well why aren't they a separate protocol from the start then?

[08:54:01.0000] <micheil>
eg, using a custom packet format, etc.

[08:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: I don't recall everything but it is likely to do with playing nice with existing infrastructure

[08:55:01.0000] <micheil>
right.

[08:55:02.0000] <micheil>
sorry, this is all a bit confusing, is it we currently have something that plays with existing infrastructure, but someone else saying that's a security flaw?

[08:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
No it's only a security flaw if you can abuse the protocol 

[08:56:01.0000] <micheil>
hmm.. it just occurred to me that it may, and may only just be possible to connect to a websocket server using an xmlhttprequest

[08:56:02.0000] <micheil>
because you have access to the headers on a xmlhttprequest

[09:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
I don't think that matters

[09:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
The problem is using websockets to access something that isn't websockets

[09:06:00.0000] <micheil>
from client or server?

[09:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
client

[09:06:02.0000] <micheil>
hm...

[09:07:00.0000] <micheil>
I don't think that'd be possible, as the client initiates with that GET request

[09:07:01.0000] <micheil>
which most other protocols would not understand, would they?

[09:07:02.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah probably most. The trick is to make it "all"

[09:08:00.0000] <micheil>
well, I can't think of one off the top of my head that would understand a http request but not be a http server

[09:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
The argument is that "I can't think of why this won't work" isn't good enough for security

[09:10:00.0000] <micheil>
true

[09:10:01.0000] <micheil>
it sort of like saying that someone abusing an smtp client could maybe pass off as something else.

[09:12:00.0000] <micheil>
there's so many different protocols, that with enough time & effort, you could probably pass on off for the other

[10:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
micheil: With the current websockets handshake you would need to trick the server into responding with the right value computed from the random bytes and th key headers

[10:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
That seems challenging; the question is whether it is good enough

[10:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
7.15km, I think that counts as a reasonable walk

[11:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
Sigh. html5lib is crashing python

[11:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well I gues lxml is really to blame

[11:21:02.0000] <jgraham>
But still I have no idea why this is happening...

[11:21:03.0000] <jgraham>
(it works fine to run the same code in ipython)

[11:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Agh, not the list @type thing again

[11:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Unless there's a <ref> element to do automatic backreferences, it makes no sense to call it semantic

[11:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1369950 -- we need a html5 parser in Haskell :)

[11:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I thought Philip` already had one

[11:35:02.0000] <jgraham>
That was O'Caml

[11:35:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh

[11:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I know a bunch of Haskell fanbois who deal with HTML and related stuff...

[11:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
"a bunch" == 2

[11:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
True

[11:37:02.0000] <jgraham>
Pretty disappointing if we were talking about bananas

[11:37:03.0000] <gsnedders>
But we're not talking about bananas.

[11:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
Depends what ou think about Haskell fanbois really

[11:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I usually buy bananas in bunches of 2

[11:38:02.0000] <Dashiva>
They go overripe too fast to buy more at a time

[11:38:03.0000] <jgraham>
I'm pretty sure that would be a pair of bananas

[11:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
No, see, there's a big bunch in the store, and then I split it into two smaller bunches, one of which has two

[11:39:01.0000] <jgraham>
If you split it into N-1 and 1, would you describe it as a bunch of one?

[11:39:02.0000] <Dashiva>
No, because then there would be no bunching, just a single banana

[11:39:03.0000] <Dashiva>
But the bunch of two is a fully connected entity

[11:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you split them apart, it'd be a pair of bananas

[11:40:01.0000] <jgraham>
Nevertheless "bunch" typically implies "large group"

[11:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But this isn't a normal-size bunch, it's a rather small bunch

[11:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
It depends if the critical feature of being a bunch in this case is a) banananess b) connectedness c) magnitude

[11:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess b) is plausible

[13:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ryanair is evil. The flight times are close to what I want. If the times of the flights on Friday and Saturday were the other way around everything would be fine...

[13:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, apart from the fact it's still Ryanair

[13:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
But at least I could fly at the time of day I want.

[13:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Which is about all you can wish for with Ryanair)

[14:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: to a very close approximation, you can't send a handshake with websocket that looks different enough from HTTP for a cross-protocol attack to be an issue

[14:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Too many negatives combined with "approximaion"

[14:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
the current handshake is fine

[14:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: That's what I'm hoping :)

[14:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
I hate OSX

[14:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Could adobe please release lightroom for linux

[14:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
Thaen all I would need would be some decent non-apple laptop (or even an apple laptop running linux) and I could be happy

[14:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I am trying to rebuild lxml to see if the previous crash has been fixed and it doesn't compile. No one on other platforms has these issues)

[14:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
lxml issues fixed... finally

[16:52:00.0000] <boblet>
anyone like to give me some feedback on a flowchart for sectioning content (the dreaded article vs section difference etc)?

[16:54:00.0000] <boblet>
aaw


2010-05-23
[05:55:00.0000] <boblet>
anyone want to give me some feedback on an HTML5 ‘choose the right element’ flowchart?

[05:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you just post the link and hang around, someone might :)

[06:15:00.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: up: http://oli-studio.com/temp/sectioning-flowchart-horiz.png :)

[06:16:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Shouldn't "any semantics" be the first block?

[06:16:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or rather, non-sectioning semantics

[06:17:00.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: do you mean the text in the first diamond?

[06:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I mean reordering the choices so the last one is first

[06:19:00.0000] <boblet>
I’m trying to start from the most specific stuff and get gradually more general, as the other direction won’t work

[06:20:00.0000] <boblet>
although I see what you mean in that I’m taking it as a given there are some semantics

[06:20:01.0000] <boblet>
(although that’s a reasonable assumption I think)

[06:20:02.0000] <Dashiva>
To take a somewhat contrived example, I'm writing a recipe as a list of steps

[06:20:03.0000] <Dashiva>
It works as a separate entry in a feed, so I should use <article> instead of <ol>?

[06:21:00.0000] <boblet>
aha, but it wouldn’t make sense in a feed without a title (recipe name)

[06:21:01.0000] <boblet>
or at least knowledge that the feed contained recipes

[06:22:00.0000] <boblet>
(might be worth adding “with a title” to <article> tho huh)

[06:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
boblet: The text rendering on that diagram looks ugly :-(

[06:22:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I think it's worthwhile to specify that the steps are to sort out sectioning elements

[06:22:03.0000] <Dashiva>
And that non-sectioning elements should be handled separately

[06:22:04.0000] <Philip`>
Also: s/it's/its/

[06:23:00.0000] <boblet>
Philip`: yeah I know — I used a for-print serif font (making as a PDF), need to change it…

[06:24:00.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: good feedback

[06:24:01.0000] <boblet>
Philip`: ouch, embarassing!

[06:24:02.0000] <boblet>
thanks

[06:24:03.0000] <Dashiva>
(Also, you have 'yes' choices, but no 'no' for the alternative paths)

[06:26:00.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: that was done for space reasons, and in the hope that it’s obvious enough to not require labeling. not obvious enough huh?

[06:26:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It is, just a style nitpick

[06:27:00.0000] <boblet>
I was hoping to put a no between the final diamond and div

[06:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
How can the media fragments WG have existed for so long without even being sure how the media fragments are supposed to be displayed?  Shouldn't the use-cases make that obvious?  Or did they start with no use-cases, only "create a media fragment syntax"?

[06:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/WD-media-fragments-reqs/ looks like their use cases

[06:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems to mix problem and solution without much analysis of what would actually be a suitable solution, though

[06:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. "Sebo is Deaf and enjoys watching videos on the Web. Her friend sent her a link to a new music video but she doesn't want to waste time and bandwidth receiving any sounds. So when she enters the URI in her browser's address bar, she also adds an extra parameter to select the video track only."

[06:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why would anyone want to use a URI for that, rather than configuring their browser to just never download audio?

[06:54:00.0000] <doublec>
it would be the same solution though wouldn't it?

[06:54:01.0000] <doublec>
If they flipped that switch in the browser the browser would use a media fragmment request on all media requests

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Requests don't contain fragments

[06:56:00.0000] <doublec>
I mean add the fragment request to the URI - or however the media fragment spec says it's done

[06:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.w3.org/2008/WebVideo/Fragments/WD-media-fragments-spec/MF-SD-ServerSideSetup.png seems to be what it suggests - the UA converts the URI fragment into some kind of HTTP headers depending on what data it needs from the server

[06:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
If the UA does it automatically then you don't need any URI fragment at all, you just need whatever HTTP features exist for requesting partial resources

[06:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
and it looks like the Media Fragments URI spec is only defining the URIs, not the HTTP features

[07:01:00.0000] <doublec>
you need the URI fragment so people can link to it in blogposts, etc

[07:01:01.0000] <doublec>
haven't you ever wanted to link to specific time ranges in a video cropped to a particular rectangle?

[07:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's a sensible use case for media fragments, but I was referring to the deaf user who supposedly modifies a URI manually in order to save time and bandwidth

[07:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
which seems a much less compelling use case

[07:04:01.0000] <doublec>
true

[07:04:02.0000] <doublec>
I fear that the grammar for fragments will evolve into some turing complete language to rip apart, demux, remux, crop, etc media

[07:04:03.0000] <doublec>
and be near impossible to implement and ue

[07:04:04.0000] <doublec>
s/ue/use

[07:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Just let people encode entire Avisynth scripts in the fragment

[07:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
That should be sufficient power

[07:06:02.0000] <doublec>
hehe

[07:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone taken a look at http://www.google.com/logos/js/pacman10-hp.3.js?

[07:11:01.0000] <doublec>
I saw the logo and played the game

[07:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
doublec: I don't care about that :

[07:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
* :)

[07:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Just seems to be using a div and Flash for the sound

[07:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Just loads of elements

[07:14:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Unusually readable for Google JS, quite a lot of identifiers still there

[07:15:00.0000] <doublec>
someone linked to a prettified version on reddit recently

[07:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Gah, the normal version with whitespace added in is really readable by Google terms. More people should try looking at Gmail. :)

[07:47:00.0000] <nessy>
note about the media fragments: this far the discussion have concentrated on time ranges and we're fairly confident that side is well defined now; but pictures and spatial stuff hasn't been discussed sufficiently

[07:48:00.0000] <nessy>
AryehGregor: keeping just a focus on a part of the picture rather than actually zooming in makes more sense for video than for single images

[07:49:00.0000] <nessy>
but the spec doesn't really prescribe the presentation, since that's to be discussed with browser vendors

[07:50:00.0000] <nessy>
just like the URI spec doesn't prescribe how to present html pages ;)

[07:57:00.0000] <boblet>
try two: http://oli-studio.com/temp/sectioning-flowchart2.png — Dashiva’s reordering (ruins the nice line I had going tho), screen capt from PDF not Graffle for less chunky fonts, addition of nav since it’s sectioning elements…

[08:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hm, I was thinking div should be the last step, and appropriate element first (just to exclude non-sectioning)

[08:04:00.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: wouldn’t that basically involve a question like “is this a sectioning element?”? :P

[08:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah

[08:06:00.0000] <boblet>
I’m still a little unsure if I prefer the any semantics q at the start or end

[08:07:00.0000] <boblet>
I’ll run it past a few more people. need to get some feedback from neubs :)

[08:19:00.0000] <boblet>
pulling those flowcharts until they’re done (should be live at HTML5Doctors on Tuesday)…

hello everybody

I don't know if i'm right here ... I'm writing a little tool that extracts ttf/otf font tables from WOFF files and saves them into a generic ttf/otf file. However I've got problems with decompressing the font tables. Does someone know more about it? 

[12:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
peta: You're not supposed to do that :)

[12:24:00.0000] <peta>
Dashiva: ouh, you mean in regard to license/copyright violations?

[12:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Nah, that applies to copying the original woff files too

[12:25:00.0000] <peta>
nono ... that's not my intention. I just was curious about the format spec ... and wanted to try it for the sake of it

[15:18:00.0000] <zcorpan_>

html4 errata?

What, where?

[15:28:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't that html5?

http://dev.w3.org/html5/profiles/drafts/ED-html5-profiles-20100522/

[15:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I blatantly need to catch up on the mailing list

[15:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Non normative errata? That couldn't posibly cause confusion

[15:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Is it inappropriate to complain that that document doesn't comply with ISO 2145?

[15:29:02.0000] <annevk>
lol

[15:29:03.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, it's inappropriate to ask that more than once

[15:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or, to be brief, yes

[15:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hangs head in shame

[15:30:02.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, about specifications complying with ISO 2145 that is and since you already did...

[15:30:03.0000] <Dashiva>
What exactly does the profile add in the rdfa example?

[15:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: I'm not sure I understand

[15:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
They seem to be suggesting it should change the predicate

[15:31:02.0000] <jgraham>
(s)

[15:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
To me the tuples look like what I'd expect without the profile too

[15:32:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
adding more attributes seems like a good way to make rdfa easier to understand

[15:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: I hink you are supposed to assume no vocabularly-specific knowledge

[15:32:03.0000] <jgraham>
*think

[15:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
It is hard to tell though because the document only specifies that the profile attribute is allowed and that URIs are processed from left to right (dunno what that means really)

[15:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
So the triple generation stuff seems to be entirely unrelated to the rest of the document

[15:36:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me wonders if the people in the Built-in image sprite support in HTML5 thread know about #SVGView()

[15:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I guess "These instructions and vocabulary terms apply to the current element and all descendant elements." is intended to be a normative requirement but it is extremely odd since this spec doesn't actually provide any processing for @profile. Therefore the relevant conformance class for that reuirement is presumably other specs)

[15:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
So I guess it's just a talisman then

[16:51:00.0000] <boblet>
hey all, where are HTML5 unit tests living?

is there a phrase for someone who’s all like “your site doesn’t validate so you’re obviously an idiot”?

[18:43:00.0000] <ako>
depends on the severity of the errors

[18:43:01.0000] <boblet>
I think this was what I was getting at: http://meiert.com/en/blog/20081120/pseudo-standardistas/

[18:44:00.0000] <ako>
e.g. if it's something that will most likely cause different DOM trees in different browsers, then he's right :>

[18:44:01.0000] <boblet>
ako: 6, of which 2 are legit (1 in a comment, 3 from plugins)

[18:44:02.0000] <ako>
if it's an unescaped & in some url... well... :>

[18:44:03.0000] <boblet>
and none of the errors cause different DOM trees

[18:45:00.0000] <ako>
in a... comment? how does that work?

[18:46:00.0000] <boblet>
apparently allowed HTML subset rules don’t apply to authors  9.9 

[18:46:01.0000] <boblet>
(fixed :)

[18:46:02.0000] <deltab>
ako: unescaped ampersands do cause real problems

[18:47:00.0000] <ako>
like?

[18:48:00.0000] <ako>
&s inside urls aren't escaped on most sites (or at least many sites)

[18:48:01.0000] <deltab>
I know of one popular forum package that turns &curr into ¤, which breaks urls containing "foo=123123&current=3234"

[18:48:02.0000] <ako>
heh

[18:48:03.0000] <deltab>
which is a pattern used by one of the larger photo hosting sites

[18:50:00.0000] <ako>
well, it's still less severe than a garbled layout

[18:50:01.0000] <ako>
well, sort of

[18:51:00.0000] <deltab>
it's caused thousands of broken links on one site alone

[18:51:01.0000] <ako>
ok here is another exampe... bullcrap attributes

[18:51:02.0000] <deltab>
likewise &lang can be turned into a left angle bracket

[18:52:00.0000] <deltab>
in comments though, it doesn't matter; only -- matters there

[18:53:00.0000] <ako>
e.g. at work i can't really use a regular validator because that .net webforms stuff together with those f-ing retarded 3rd party controls generates pure junk markup

[18:53:01.0000] <ako>
i can only check if it's at least sorta well formed

[18:54:00.0000] <ako>
(my "validator" uses very sloppy rules)

[18:54:01.0000] <deltab>
the questions that really matter are "Have I made a mistake?" and "Will browsers understand this?"

[18:55:00.0000] <ako>
yes, hence the sloppy validator it can only catch things which will most likely break things in horrible ways

[18:55:01.0000] <deltab>
an SGML validator such as the one at validator.w3.org is poor at answering either question

[18:55:02.0000] <deltab>
validator.nu is better

[18:56:00.0000] <ako>
e.g. it will complain about <a><b></a></b> or if a tag isn't closed... but it uses sloppy rules for <br/>, <img/> or <p></p> for example

[18:57:00.0000] <ako>
well, in theory one could run automated tests... where the generated dom is sent back to the server

[18:58:00.0000] <ako>
but that would be quite a lot of work

[18:58:01.0000] <deltab>
you could set that up with Selenium

[18:59:00.0000] <ako>
sill... you'd need a bunch of machines for that crap

[19:00:00.0000] <ako>
oh well... nn

I haven't played NetHack in months, and only beat it like three times, but once in a while I still see something like "nn" and my first reaction is "two nymphs standing next to each other, watch out!"

[19:20:00.0000] <estellevw>
Can anyone tell me if the spellcheck attribute i supported in any browser and how i can test it?

[19:21:00.0000] <estellevw>
i supported = is supported

[19:26:00.0000] <Aleoss>
estellevw: It should be supported in Chrome and FF for sure.

[19:27:00.0000] <estellevw>
other than the spec, i am not finding any documentation

[19:27:01.0000] <Aleoss>
estellevw: The only way to check it is test it out. Or unless someone already did that and did a report on a blog that can be found via Google.

[19:28:00.0000] <Aleoss>
estellevw: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_%28HTML5%29#Global

[19:28:01.0000] <Aleoss>
estellevw: Learn to Google.

[19:28:02.0000] <estellevw>
I do google

[19:28:03.0000] <estellevw>
learn to be less arrogant

[19:29:00.0000] <Aleoss>
estellevw: You said all you could find is the spec.

[19:30:00.0000] <Aleoss>
estellevw: As I hypothesised. FF supports it and Chrome supports it but not to the spec standards.

[19:30:01.0000] <estellevw>
right.

I procrastinate too much to get things done hehe

[22:44:02.0000] <jwm>
been working 13 years almost to get a network platform going

[22:44:03.0000] <jwm>
I guess I've been waiting for the right platform :)

[22:45:00.0000] <jwm>
didn't imagine the web would end up to potentially be that 

[22:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the perfect storm

[22:47:00.0000] <jwm>
yeah

[22:47:01.0000] <jwm>
now I am excited about the peer to peer provisions in the new spec

[22:47:02.0000] <jwm>
I'd like to do a social network and also distributed.net/folding@home esque payload system

hehe

[22:49:03.0000] <jwm>
their 10.50 launch page

picking daisies?

[23:32:04.0000] <jwm>
might as well say that

been reading news, thinking up ideas

[23:33:01.0000] <jwm>
keeping my mind broad heh

[23:33:02.0000] <jwm>
redesigning my site every other week

I'm one of the mom's basement non-success stories

[23:33:05.0000] <jwm>
the only thing I have going for me is I have cool 4 letter domain names 

[23:34:00.0000] <jwm>
because I managed to register them before school zones did (dist domains were used for distRICT) heh

[23:34:01.0000] <jwm>
except a domain squatter did beat me to dist.com

[23:34:02.0000] <jwm>

nessy: http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-May/026456.html is well put

[23:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe even FAQ-worthy

[23:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
though I don't know which FAQ would be the right place for it

[23:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: in particular, what you say about lessons learned from the last 10 years

[23:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jwm: well, the next 13 years are going to make the last 13 look boring

[23:40:01.0000] <jwm>
I know MikeSmith 

[23:40:02.0000] <jwm>
especially if peer to peer unfolds

[23:40:03.0000] <jwm>
I think that has the potential to unseat google 

[23:40:04.0000] <jwm>
heck any ISP

[23:40:05.0000] <jwm>
heh

[23:41:00.0000] <roc>
if software patents and locked-down platforms continue their meteoric rise, the next 13 year are going to be very boring indeed

[23:41:01.0000] <jwm>
if the stupid ISPs would stop throttling outbound speeds

[23:41:02.0000] <jwm>
that's why peer to peer is so nice roc

[23:41:03.0000] <roc>
P2P doesn't help with those issues at all

[23:41:04.0000] <jwm>
create your own protected from government space 

[23:41:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
roc: I think we need for things to get worse before they get better

[23:41:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
(as far as patents go)

[23:41:07.0000] <jwm>
have you looked at freenet?

[23:41:08.0000] <jwm>
it helps

[23:42:00.0000] <jwm>
there are a lot of projects to help people living behind firewalls heh

[23:42:01.0000] <jwm>
even 'civilized countries' are creating bad information policies

[23:46:00.0000] <roc>
a future where innovation is restricted to a few outlaws on darknets isn't a very innovative one

[23:46:01.0000] <jwm>
that's if the peer to peer is done using freenet's ways

[23:47:00.0000] <jwm>
not web tech which is more expansive and will be harder to block without blocking legitimate web traffic

[01:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
me just now finds http://www.robglidden.com/2010/05/how-googles-open-sourcing-of-vp8-harms-the-open-web/

[01:19:01.0000] <jwm>
ehe

[01:19:02.0000] <jwm>
how opening a protocol harms a set of open protocol :)

[01:19:03.0000] <jwm>
s

[01:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"leaving VP8 code out in the open with nothing but a mutual non-assert license leaves the patent issue not only unaddressed, but up for capture by those with uncharitable agendas, and on their turf and time frame"

[01:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"Contributing VP8 to a standards group with a strong patent disclosure policy would be a good corrective move; it would force lurking patent holders to come fully into the public"

[01:23:00.0000] <jwm>
yeah

[01:23:01.0000] <jwm>
I completely agree

[01:23:02.0000] <jwm>
it has come about very weirdly

[01:23:03.0000] <jwm>
and I do think maybe google is still trying to figure it out

[01:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I did suggest to Google that VP8 should be submitted to a standards group with disclosure rules and relevant patent holders present

[01:24:01.0000] <jwm>
I mean vp8 seemed to come from left field when nobody was watching

[01:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
they seemed surprisingly uninterested in taking it to a standards body

[01:25:00.0000] <jwm>
well

[01:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
given the spec they have now, a second independent implementation would be almost impossible

[01:25:02.0000] <jwm>
there may be a better reason for that than they are afraid of it being vulnerable to other patents

[01:25:03.0000] <jwm>
it may be because h264 has so much steam they want to get out the door real fast

[01:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: have they actually made the spec (such as it is) publicly available yet?

[01:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: have you read http://www.robglidden.com/2010/05/how-googles-open-sourcing-of-vp8-harms-the-open-web/ yet?

[01:28:01.0000] <nessy>
nope, doing now

[01:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: yes

[01:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.webmproject.org/en/us/media/pdf/vp8_bitstream.pdf

[01:29:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah yeah

[01:29:03.0000] <othermaciej>
many things are spec'd only as C code though

[01:30:00.0000] <nessy>
MikeSmith: Rob has never understood that open source communities build de-facto standards, too

[01:31:00.0000] <jwm>
well he mentioned that he thinks it should be open for the patent holders to look at too

[01:31:01.0000] <jwm>
like lawyer friendly docs

[01:31:02.0000] <jwm>
:)

[01:31:03.0000] <nessy>
he was trying to develop the open video standard format while in Sun

[01:31:04.0000] <nessy>
trying to go down the same path that Google has taken a lot more successfully now

[01:32:00.0000] <nessy>
it's amazing what you can do with the right funding ;)

[01:32:01.0000] <jwm>
hehe

[01:32:02.0000] <jwm>
problem is now google is getting so big that it can't keep track of what it is doing

[01:33:00.0000] <jwm>
I read an article about some engineers that work at google that didn't know 2.2 android was being released 

[01:33:01.0000] <jwm>
kind of shocked me 

[01:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: the "spec'd only as C code" thing seems to have generated quite a bit of ridicule already

[01:34:00.0000] <nessy>
even submitting a codec to a standards group doesn't get the lurking patent holders out of the thicked

[01:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
jwm: android engineers?

[01:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: true

[01:34:03.0000] <jwm>
MikeSmith: not quite android engineers but not too outside the mobile division

[01:34:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it certainly raises the bar some

[01:35:00.0000] <jwm>
you'd think maybe they'd of gotten a hey froto is released email or something :)

[01:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it should be taken to a standards group not just because of IPR issues, but because, if it's supposed to become a critical part of the open web, it should be specified by a group where all stakeholders can participate, and specified in a way that multiple independent implementations are possible

[01:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
anything that has only a single viable implementation is not an open standard

[01:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jwm: not sure what "not too outside the mobile division" means, but it doesn't seem terrifically surprising that engineers working on other projects didn't all know about the release

[01:36:01.0000] <jwm>
they should of developed vp8 in amaya first :)

[01:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: if it ends up being that it has only a single viable implementation, that would seem to be true

[01:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
difficult to see how it's going to get to multiple implementations without actually speccing it properly

[01:38:01.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: are you quoting or is that your statement?

[01:38:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wonder if multiple implementations is an actual goal or not

[01:38:03.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: that's my statement

[01:39:00.0000] <nessy>
I agree with the need for an independent implementation

[01:39:01.0000] <nessy>
I would think Google would encourage that, too

[01:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(and not necessarily the opinion of my employer, any open source projects I am involved with, or any standards bodies I am involved with)

[01:39:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: I think this guy needs some assistance: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2895214/what-is-the-semantically-correct-way-to-use-the-article-tag-in-html-5-with

[01:40:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: thanks for the email. will check SF out

[01:40:01.0000] <boblet>
woops SO

[01:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: I guess it's one thing to encourage in principle, another thing to actually do the real work in practice to make sure it happens

[01:41:01.0000] <nessy>
I don't think though that a standard necessarily needs to be defined by a group of stakeholders - in particular something as complex as a video codec will take ages to create in a group - MPEG seems to be working on one such, so maybe that can become the successor to WebMM

[01:42:00.0000] <nessy>
I think for now, WebM can fill the need for a baseline codec and is independent enough from Google to be acceptable

[01:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what's the advantage of not taking WebM to a standards body?

[01:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
ok, there is the resource cost, but clearly for Google that would be pocket change

[01:44:00.0000] <jwm>
isn't webm just for the container which is matroska?

[01:44:01.0000] <nessy>
the advantage that WebM has on its side compared to Theora (apart from better quality) is that there is a patent gorilla behind it to defend it *should* a patent suit happen - plus they threw their engineering force at it to build the software patches to provide application support - plus they threw their relationships at it to get other commercial entities behind it, too

[01:44:02.0000] <nessy>
jwm: if so, s/WebM/VP8/ :-)

[01:45:00.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: I am all for taking it to a standards body, too

[01:45:01.0000] <annevk>
from what I heard Google was interested in taking it to a standards body at some point

[01:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
webm is both the container and (I think) the collective name for the container/codec suite

[01:45:03.0000] <jwm>
I think vp8 is just an interrim project

[01:46:00.0000] <nessy>
I was probably one of the first to say that is a good idea even before it all happened - but it will take a long time and in the meantime VP8 can grow in support around an open source community, like many other technologies

[01:46:01.0000] <jwm>
http://www.matroska.org/news/webm-matroska.html

[01:47:00.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: what other chance do we have for a baseline codec, realistically?

[01:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think they are interested in it the same way I am interested in exercising more at some point - vaguely in favor, but no concrete plans that would actually lead to that result

[01:47:02.0000] <jwm>
the only thing nice about software patents is when they expire 

[01:47:03.0000] <jwm>
so we just need to wait another 10 years and we can use h264

[01:47:04.0000] <jwm>
just like gif :)

[01:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: I'm not aware of a currently viable solution, but it's possible that WebM/VP8 could be one in the future

[01:48:01.0000] <nessy>
why is it not viable now?

[01:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the IP situation is unknown, it's not an open standard, and it does not yet have any hardware support (and is apparently hard to implement in hardware)

[01:50:00.0000] <nessy>
we know that Google has patents on it and would be one of the first targets if something went wrong with IP - that's not an unknown patent situation IMHO

[01:51:00.0000] <nessy>
what consists an "open standard" is a matter of discussion - is RSS an open standard? is SRT?

[01:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe after some time has passed it will be more clear whether anyone wants to make an IP claim (or if it went through a standards process with disclosure requirements, it would at least get IP claims of the usual suspects out in the open)

[01:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
RSS - yes, it has a published spec, and multiple independent implementations

[01:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
SRT - no adequate spec, but Hixie is trying to fix that

[01:53:00.0000] <nessy>
is that your criteria for an open standard? interesting...

[01:53:01.0000] <nessy>
so, theora is an open standard?

[01:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know enough about theora to say

[01:54:01.0000] <nessy>
I guess on the HW front, we should see soon...

[01:55:00.0000] <nessy>
btw: I don't see a need to write WebM into HTML5 as the baseline codec now - I think the market will decide more than anything else

[01:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
are there any theora decoders that are not derivative works of the original VP3 code drop?

[01:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I agree, it is likely the market will decide

[01:56:00.0000] <nessy>
sometimes a de-facto standard can be achieved quicker than a standard that is created through lengthy discussions between many parties

[01:57:00.0000] <nessy>
the theora codebase now has a couple of serious forks by different groups, but I actually don't think anyone cared to write a completely new implementation

[01:58:00.0000] <nessy>
they are all still format-conformant, so not spec forks, but only forks for different platforms

[01:59:00.0000] <nessy>
but anyone could build an independent re-implementation if they wanted to - strangely nobody has cared to yet

[02:00:00.0000] <nessy>
maybe what needs to be done to encourage independent implementations is to make sure that the reference implementation is really bad ;)

[02:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
now that Google owns On2's patents I guess they could also clarify that the patent rights are not tied to the specific implementation

[02:03:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, from what I heard it sounded like there were plans, but I could be mistaken I suppose

[02:03:01.0000] <annevk>
(re standards body)

[02:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah I have no idea really

[02:11:00.0000] <jwm>
anyone know if the peer to peer provisions in html5 will be brought back to life?

[02:11:01.0000] <jwm>
maybe in a websocket form?

[02:11:02.0000] <jwm>
or if I could help in doing that?

[02:12:00.0000] <annevk>
if someone figures out the communication protocols that would go a long way

[02:12:01.0000] <annevk>
so if you can do that :)

[02:12:02.0000] <jwm>
well if you do it over websocket

[02:12:03.0000] <jwm>
that wouldn't be a problem would it?

[02:12:04.0000] <jwm>
you just specify a socket receive functionality

[02:12:05.0000] <annevk>
that only solves client <> server

[02:12:06.0000] <annevk>
not client <> client

[02:13:00.0000] <jwm>
I'm going to be starting a web based p2p network project

[02:13:01.0000] <jwm>
and I'd like to use web standards completely

[02:14:00.0000] <annevk>
no need for motivation, I'm sure we'd all love to have it :)

[02:14:01.0000] <jwm>
I think that would change the face of the web completely

[02:14:02.0000] <jwm>
or not the face but the landscape :)

[02:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>

now wondering if I should change my templates based on my own advice :S

[02:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[02:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, "the new license Google is using for the project is one that's not been submitted to the Open Source Initiative for approval. As it stands it possibly can't be approved due to Google's ironic inclusion of a "field of use" restriction in the patent grant"

[02:20:00.0000] <annevk>
grmbl

[02:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that article is inaccurate on one point (by implication)

[02:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MPEG-LA does not offer any indemnification

[02:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
who does offer indemnification?

[02:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what instances are there of companies/organizations actually offering indemnification for a particular technology?

[02:22:01.0000] <jwm>
why don't we just use gstreamer or something else to do video

[02:22:02.0000] <jwm>
why put the codec in the browser

[02:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: it apparently does happen sometimes but I don't know much about this area

[02:24:00.0000] <annevk>
jwm, we don't want to end up with a plethora of formats everyone has to support on whatever device imaginable

[02:25:00.0000] <jwm>
but that won't happen, the market will decide

[02:25:01.0000] <jwm>
I'd rather it left be open so that the market can be open to new formats

[02:26:00.0000] <jwm>
video/audio is something that is always developing

[02:26:01.0000] <jwm>
some new tech seems to come out all the new time

[02:26:02.0000] <jwm>
-new

[02:28:00.0000] <boblet>
new video tech!? quick, someone start a patent pool

[02:28:01.0000] <boblet>
it’s getting hot, and we’ll need something to drink martinis by pretty soon…

[02:30:00.0000] <ment>
what does patent pool mean?

[02:30:01.0000] <boblet>
that’s what the lawyers can afford to buy after litigation :|

[02:31:00.0000] <ment>
lol

[02:31:01.0000] <boblet>
I _think_ it means making a list of all the patents you have that you think you can sue the competing guys with

[02:31:02.0000] <boblet>
(but my first definition seems more accurate to me)

[02:32:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: added <p> to the flowchart of doom, but not as a new diamond: http://oli-studio.com/temp/sectioning-flowchart3.png

[02:32:01.0000] <boblet>
should anyone have flowchart feedback it would be gratefully received. especially if you aren’t too sure about the whole section/article thing

[02:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: ah, that looks good

[02:34:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: i kinda liked the linearity of the last one, but Dashiva’s reordering suggestion is prolly better for ppl who aren’t familiar

[02:34:01.0000] <boblet>
it’s hard to know if this will still make sense to ‘normal’ people

[02:35:00.0000] <jwm>
yeah not enough nudity 

[02:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
normal people don't choose elements manually

[02:35:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
they push buttons

[02:35:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and turn knobs

[02:36:00.0000] <boblet>
jwm: I took my t-shirt off, any improvement?

[02:36:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: well, ‘normal’ webmonkeys then

[02:36:02.0000] <jwm>
these are standards we're dealing with, you need to document your taking of your shirt off next time

[02:36:03.0000] <boblet>
the ones that are all section/article confused

[02:37:00.0000] <boblet>
jwm: sheesh

[02:37:01.0000] <jwm>
why not just steal visios graphics?

[02:37:02.0000] <boblet>

[02:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

[02:43:02.0000] <jwm>
you know I never hear much about what he thinks of w3c

[02:43:03.0000] <jwm>
or web in general

[02:44:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk said the Keio no-shirt parties are really steamy

[02:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
The man uses email to get web pages

[02:44:02.0000] <jwm>
I know he hates how closed off the code/systems are that run servers

[02:44:03.0000] <jgraham>
That should tell you everything

[02:44:04.0000] <jwm>
I wonder if he'd appreciate a p2p web

[02:45:00.0000] <jwm>
where the software was all in the browser

[03:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
jwm, tor and freenet have P2P web solutions, and they're slow and painful to use.

[03:14:00.0000] <jwm>
they are slow anyway

boblet: Your images seem to have disappeared

Dashiva: try again

[05:03:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
anyone knows how to coerce youporn into giving html5 video ?

[05:03:01.0000] <erlehmann_>
i heard it had this, but i only see flash.

[05:04:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
aside, when porn picks up html5, it is ready ;)

[05:06:00.0000] <ment>
so "html5 readiness research" is in fact looking at porn all day? :)

[05:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
erlehmann_: ycombinator?

[05:11:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
Dashiva, wtf are you talking about.

[05:11:01.0000] <erlehmann_>
i have no idea what ycombinator is.

[05:11:02.0000] <jgraham>
ment: Only if you are Hyatt, probably

[05:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
erlehmann_: I heard the claim that youporn had html5 video earlier, but I could only source it to a single post from there

[05:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
erlehmann_: It's a venture capital company for tech startups. But, more relevantly, it is the home of Hacker News

[05:12:02.0000] <erlehmann_>
Dashiva, i read it on netzpolitik.org, but they didn't name any sources.

[05:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
erlehmann_: Which is like reddit but without many of the things that make reddit crap

[05:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The actual youporn site just links to .3gp file

[05:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
erlehmann_: and some unique things that make it crap

[05:13:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Which, true enough, isn't flash

[05:18:00.0000] <nielsle>
If you launch a html5 based youporn competitor now, then you will be able to target a large group of linux-using virgins.

[05:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
They would never use closed-source porn

[05:23:00.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: oh, any feedback? I’m getting “not understandable for normal webmonkeys” from someone, and am worried it’s true :)

[05:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I would agree, but at the same time normal webmonkeys would probably never think to use such a chart anyway

[05:24:01.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: ohrly?

[05:24:02.0000] <Dashiva>
The users would have to be semantic-conscious enough to actually care about the right element

[05:37:00.0000] <slartsa>
apparently youporn is a necessary element of html development :)

[05:39:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
we should make youporn use websockets with draft76 to settle the handshake

[05:43:00.0000] <jgraham>

gsnedders: Genshi

[05:47:00.0000] <slartsa>
this channel is kinky, I like it here

[05:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
slartsa: Wait, what sort of porn do you think we're talking about?

[05:48:00.0000] <slartsa>
any you could think of ;)

                     ^ you are here

[05:48:03.0000] <jgraham>
This is quite far above the average for the channel as you see

[05:49:00.0000] <slartsa>
Awesomeness.

erlehmann_: Install the firefox plugin named user agent switcher. If you set your use agent to iphone then you can watch some of the videos as mp4.

[06:02:02.0000] <erlehmann_>
???

[06:02:03.0000] <erlehmann_>
besides, vp8 has double the version number

[06:03:00.0000] <erlehmann_>
so it must be TWICE AS GOOD

[06:03:01.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: I’m hoping to make something that the ppl who use http://www.flickr.com/photos/antoniolupetti/3894233282/sizes/l/ or http://media.smashingmagazine.com/cdn_smash/wp-content/uploads/images/html5-cheat-sheet/preview.gif would find useful

[06:14:00.0000] <boblet>
would you say that the figure element is tangentially related, or part of the page’s main content?

[06:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's part of the main content, but doesn't need to be inside the main content

[06:23:00.0000] <boblet>
Dashiva: thanks, that’s what I thought

[06:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
At least that's how I understand it. If it wasn't part of the main content it'd be an <aside>

[06:26:00.0000] <boblet>
I’m actually wondering if the presentation (something with caption) will end up trumping the “could be moved to a different place, such as an appendix” part

[06:27:00.0000] <boblet>
am thinking that I’ve used figure for content that if moved would kill the article :/

[06:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I think it's a common guideline to require all figures to be referenced explicitly in the main text

[06:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Serving as the "entry point" where it's natural to look at the figure

[07:26:00.0000] <nessy>
wow - nothing makes my browsers steam up my laptop as much as loading the html5 spec!

[07:27:00.0000] <slartsa>
http://hixie.ch/tests/evil/html/parsing/compat/001.html try that

[07:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
nessy: I bet the Web Applications 1.0 spec steams it up more

[07:29:00.0000] <nessy>
you mean: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/ ?

[07:30:00.0000] <nessy>
that's the one I meant ;-)

[07:30:01.0000] <nessy>
maybe I shouldn't use "html5 spec" for it, but "html5" has become a placeholder for all the modern web app specs, I guess

[07:31:00.0000] <nessy>
haha - only seconds after loading that page, Chrome goes haywire and the same for firefox

[07:31:01.0000] <slartsa>
:P

[07:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
nessy: No, I mean http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html

[07:32:00.0000] <nessy>
Philip`: you're right - that page makes it take off even before the page is loaded

[07:34:00.0000] <slartsa>
took 10 seconds to load but works

[07:34:01.0000] <slartsa>
HUGE amount of data

[07:40:00.0000] <doublec>
nessy, try doing an incremental search in firefox with the complete whatwg spec loaded

[07:40:01.0000] <doublec>
nessy, definitely painful

[07:41:00.0000] <nessy>
/me shudders

[07:41:01.0000] <nessy>
the html5 spec is definitely the challenge of the future for web browsers ;)

[07:41:02.0000] <doublec>
browsing the spec with curl http://... |less however is fast

[07:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What you really want is http://gsnedders.html5.org/html5.txt

[07:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
You want the PDF, since that (I assume?) has working hyperlinks

[07:45:00.0000] <doublec>
gsnedders, you are right, that txt file is nice

[07:46:00.0000] <doublec>
27.584 references, wow!

I am toying with a canvas based painting program, and I want to make an eraser. In other words I want make the canvas transparent again.  Can I define a strokeStyle that does this?

[07:53:00.0000] <nielsle>
(I hope that I am in the right channel.. I tried to judge from previous conversation :) )

[07:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
nielsle: You should be able to do it by setting globalCompositeOperation

[07:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
to e.g. destination-out (I think)

[07:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
and then draw a solid line

[07:55:02.0000] <nielsle>
Cool thanks.

[07:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Maybe it's more like source-out or something)

[08:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hum, http://www.osnews.com/story/23346/Nero_Files_Antitrust_Case_Against_MPEG-LA

[08:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It seems there are lawsuits all over lately

[08:25:00.0000] <nessy>
Dashiva: that's a good thing - stuff gets clarified in lawsuites

[08:25:01.0000] <nessy>
stops FUD from happening

[08:29:00.0000] <boblet>
and lawyers get new pools

[08:39:00.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: just got my suspicions of earlier on confirmed about theora - there are indeed two independent implementations - the one from xiph and the one from ffmpeg - they both originated from vp3 code, but both have changed so much that there is assumed there is no code overlap any longer

[10:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So, suppose I'm a web developer and give users the ability to create images somehow.  Suppose the user provides no alt text, for whatever reason.  Should I put no alt attribute, or empty alt text, or something else?  Is there any guidance about this?

[10:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's one of the controversial areas

[10:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I figured.

[10:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems to me that logically, you'd want to either have no alt attribute or a magic value.  Having alt="" or the filename or whatever strikes me as bad from everyone's perspective.

[10:14:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes

[10:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it also strikes me that if you allow this, then suddenly zillions of sites will have to switch from alt="" to your magic value and everyone will be forced to admit that few sites have ever used decent alt text.

[10:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
As opposed to calling required alt text a success, as a Mozilla developer recently did on public-html.

[10:15:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Heh

[10:15:03.0000] <jgraham>
You just use missing alt as your magic value

[10:15:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, that seems to make the most sense.

[10:15:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, the controversy isn't just the syntax, but also whether it should be conforming or not

[10:15:06.0000] <jgraham>
Not to the Experts

[10:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But then you get people complaining that your app isn't conforming, unless missing alt text is conforming.

[10:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
unless they changed their minds

[10:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you're pressured into missing alt text.

[10:16:03.0000] <Dashiva>
That's how it ends up, yes

[10:16:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, you're pressured into adding empty or useless alt text.

[10:16:05.0000] <Dashiva>
If missing alt is the solution, and missing alt is nonconforming, you get bogus alt

[10:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If magic value is the solution, you get bogus magic value

[10:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What I'd like is some guidance that actually tells me what the best course of action is for screen readers.

[10:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
Current or future or science-fiction screen readers?

[10:17:03.0000] <Dashiva>
If missing alt is the solution, and missing alt is conforming, you get "but that's not machine checkable"

[10:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Surely screen readers need to know the difference between "don't know what the alt should be" and "alt should be empty, this is decorative".

[10:17:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Current or near future.

[10:17:06.0000] <Dashiva>
Screen readers want missing alt

[10:17:07.0000] <Dashiva>
They have to handle those anyway

[10:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, do they want it more than filler like the filename?

[10:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I assume they could fill in the filename themselves.

[10:18:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or other useful info.

[10:18:03.0000] <Philip`>
Decorative is easy, that's just alt=""

[10:18:04.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm sure you can find enough screen readers to justify either case

[10:18:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Because apparently we have to consider every version of every product ever released

[10:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(JAWS is currently version 11, but version 4 is brought up in discussions...)

[10:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
And every user's configuration of said products

[10:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe nobody upgrades JAWS because of how ludicrously expensive it is?

[10:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's the common argument

[10:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
A blind person once told me Mac's built-in screen reader is the best.

[10:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Other blind people may say very different things

[10:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is unaware of objective comparisons between the various products

[10:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me guesses people learn to use one and then want to stick with it for a long time, because it's so hard to learn another even if it's supposedly better

[10:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
What he said completely met my expectations of the different platforms, though, so I'm inclined to believe him.

[10:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
He said on Windows, the software is lousy, made by third parties, and unreasonably expensive.

[10:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
On Linux, it's still lousy, but at least it's free.

[10:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
On Mac, it comes with the OS and is excellent.

[10:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd expect Apple to make a good screen reader.  It's the sort of thing they do well.  UI, basically.

[10:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Whereas open-source stuff, and random special-purpose Windows apps, tend to have lousy UI.

[10:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like JAWS is about $900, but presumably you get significant discounts via employers or other groups

[10:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
so maybe JAWS + a cheap Windows PC/laptop is still cheaper than a Mac

[10:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can surely get a Mac of some kind for $900.

[10:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can, but you can get a Windows one for much less, and the difference may be greater than a discounted JAWS

[10:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like it won't be a huge difference, though

[10:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why do you assume that you can get a discounted JAWS so easily?

[10:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't that the norm?

[10:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Bulk discounts for organizations

[10:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Because they talk about multi-user pricing on their site, and because I vaguely remember some mentioning how people often get that kind of thing through an employer rather than buying it personally

[10:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
though I could be entirely misremembering and/or wrong

[10:38:04.0000] <Philip`>
s/some/someone/

[10:38:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, if you have an entire organization of blind people, yes.

[10:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I assume they can charge so much for JAWS because users can get some kind of subsidy

[10:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Any reasonably large organisation will probably have enough to make it worthwhile

[10:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
On the other hand, maybe blind people do tend to work for companies full of blind people.  I suppose they'd have some trouble at a random employer, even in a carefully-selected field.

[10:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders about that.

[10:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I would assume most blind people are members of an interest organization for blind (or somewhat more general)

[10:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The first time I ever saw a blind person actually at work was here at Google.

[10:40:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dude works in one of the nearby buildings.

[10:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, *most*?  Really?

[10:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can't imagine it's most.

[10:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, I'd be totally unsurprised if Google made a point of employing more blind and deaf people than normal.

[10:41:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

[10:41:03.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Why not?

[10:41:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Do you know what he does?

[10:41:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: No clue.

[10:41:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
I just see him at lunch.

[10:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, because . . . there are surely way more blind people than employees of blind-person advocacy groups?

[10:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
So if I have a document with some timeouts and document.write in it in such a way that the original document is blown away, should the timeouts still fire?

[10:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: first thought is no.  That is not based on any evidence or even knowledge, though.

[10:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah that is my first thought, based on the same

[10:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Are you attempting to apply logic to determine the expected outcome?

[10:43:03.0000] <othermaciej>
wikipedia says: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness#Epidemiology

[10:43:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Yes.  In absence of reality, logic is all we have.

[10:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: I'm afraid you are violating this channel's rules

[10:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, I guess when it comes to blindness you have to remember that not everyone who's legally blind is really fully blind.

[10:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"do the timeouts still fire" is probably a more relevant question

[10:45:02.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: How does employees figure into it?

[10:45:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Damn, you're right.

[10:45:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
My mother once taught an art course with a blind art major in it, who was an excellent student and got an A.

[10:45:05.0000] <Dashiva>
I said member, not employee

[10:45:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
I need to base more opinions on knee-jerk opinions, then.

[10:45:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
She could still see a little.

[10:45:08.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: that article distinguishes those of the legally blind who are not totally blind as "low vision"

[10:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
although many low vision persons have low enough vision that they would in practice need a screen reader to use a compuer

[10:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, oh, I misread you.  Then you might be right.

[10:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
"Approximately ten percent of those deemed legally blind, by any measure, have no vision. The rest have some vision, from light perception alone to relatively good acuity. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_vision is sometimes used to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200."

[10:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Damn, really?  Without contacts I'm legally blind, then.

[10:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Opinions are fine because they're easy to detect and ignore; logic is dangerous because it tricks you into believing its conclusions are true

[10:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Makes sense.  There's no way I can drive without contacts or glasses.  I'd kill myself and others.

[10:47:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, it all says "with best correction possible".

[10:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So it's measuring how good your vision is *with* contacts or glasses or whatever.

[10:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
so we should stick to opinions and facts (and ignore the former)

[10:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Ah, kk.  Well, still, my statement stands.  Without contacts I'm blind.  ^_^

[10:48:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: That's disturbingly convincing.

[10:48:04.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Are cyborg eyes possible?

[10:48:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, surely you mean we should ignore the latter.

[10:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, it says "spectacle or contact lens correction", which excludes that

[10:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: You and I have nearly identical commenting patterns.  (Based on gavinsharp's room stats.)

[10:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, one of the pages says that)

[10:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, oh, you mean like time zones.  Odd.  You're on the West Coast, right?

[10:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
*And* I tend to go to bed early, which should exacerbate the difference.

[10:51:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Now I am, yeah.  But I was Central for most of my commenting history.

[10:51:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, that makes more sense.

[10:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Also, I'm rarely in the room in the evening, so you going to bed early actually helps align us.

[10:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Blue isn't even visible for either of us.

[10:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm pretty sure I've never commented in a blue time.

[10:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm sure I have occasionally, although it doesn't say the time zone.

[10:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
Isn't gavin in Mountain View? Although his server might not be of course

[10:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It has to be an american time zone, or else I'd be in blue at some point.

[10:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What if it's a Canadian time zone?!

[10:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
We own those time zones too.

[10:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
alternately: I meant american supercontinent.

[10:56:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
No one in America follows Newfoundland time.

[10:56:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's not aligned on one-hour boundaries.

[10:56:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nobody cares about newfie time, though, so it's all right.

[10:56:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also too far east.

[10:56:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Granted.

[10:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Typical Wikipedia moment: "Oh, so is that what it's called?  *reads*"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_paving

[10:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Huh.  I always thought that was just for grip or something.

[10:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I never realized it was for blind people, although it makes sense.

[11:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
boblet's in Japan, right?

[11:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
His 404 page is Japanese, at least

[11:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me always knew they were for blind people, but assumed they were to tell blind people where it was safe to cross the road, rather than to tell them where it's *not* safe to walk without care

[11:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Good accessiblity is multi-purpose!

[11:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, that wouldn't explain why they're on the edges of train platforms.

[11:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Indeed, my assumption of the explanation did not fit perfectly with reality

[12:25:00.0000] <jwm>
http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=377

[12:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what self-raising flour is in Swedish, and what grease-proof paper is

[12:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me also wonders whether to cook today or tomorrow

[13:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: grease-proof paper: wax paper?  or parchment paper?

[13:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Um, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greaseproof_paper

[13:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, kk.

[13:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: self-rasing lour doesn't exist

[13:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: gah,

[13:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
you just have to use ordinary flour + baking powder

[13:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*gah

[13:24:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: What's baking powder, then?

[13:24:05.0000] <jgraham>
Something quite obviosu

[13:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
Bakpulver

[13:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ah, ok

[13:25:02.0000] <jgraham>
Greaseproof paper is something like Bakpaper

[13:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is proving how much baking he's done in the past year

[13:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
I don't know the Swedish for "my oven's on fire" so if you reach that stage you're on your own

[13:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has concluded he'll just bake after lunch tomorrow

[13:27:02.0000] <jgraham>
What?

[13:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, it's a bit on the late side already, and it won't take long

[13:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(See, having lunch at $ridiculousTime has advantages

[13:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://www.robglidden.com/2010/05/how-googles-open-sourcing-of-vp8-harms-the-open-web/

[13:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So is the argument here that we should put web video on pause for 10 years while stuff is developed?

[13:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: And now you're going to call me insane :P

[13:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: I'd like to believe that the dude recognizes that every solution is bad, and that he's merely pointing out the badness of the particular solution that Google chose.

[13:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It doesn't seem that way. "It is well known that many experts consider it now feasible to standardize serviceable royalty-free codecs." and "Google should get on board on this important trend, not undermine it"

[13:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
This also seems to show a misunderstanding of how patent trolls work: "Contributing VP8 to a standards group with a strong patent disclosure policy would be a good corrective move; it would force lurking patent holders to come fully into the public."

[13:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I'd just like to believe that.

[13:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Truthfully he seems to be painfully naive.  I noticed that last one you quoted in particular.

[13:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, a strong patent disclosure policy like ISO, which produced H.264?

[13:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Disclosure isn't the same as licensing.

[13:51:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup, I think he has a mistaken idea of what it means to "disclose" a patent.

[13:51:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Patent trolls don't join groups with patent licensing policies.

[13:51:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
It can mean "Yup, we have a patent.  Have fun licensing it!"

[13:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even in a group like the W3C, anyone with patents could always refuse to join the Working Group rather than disclose or license its patents.

[13:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Assuming they're a member in the first place.

[13:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But I read another thing somewhere else. What if someone came up with a patent that turned out to be essential to h264, and refuse to license it. Could they shut down everyone using h264?

[13:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure, in theory.  You don't have to license your patents to anyone.

[13:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's unlikely that they wouldn't accept whatever payout they were offered, though.

[13:55:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, we could just have H.264a released really quickly to work around the patent.

[13:55:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Plus there's H.265 one of these days.  So it wouldn't help much, I don't think.

[13:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, the concept was that someone would do it because they wanted to give open video a boost by shutting down the best alternative

[13:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That would be somewhat hilarious, actually.

[14:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I submitted a comment to glidden's post expanding on what we're saying here.

[15:08:00.0000] <annevk>
omg lost

[15:08:01.0000] <annevk>
still can't fathom it

[15:08:02.0000] <annevk>
"retardation" comes to mind

[15:09:00.0000] <ment>
lost what?

[15:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
The TV series?

[15:09:02.0000] <ment>
ah, Lost :)

[15:09:03.0000] <ment>
well now i'm glad i've stopped watching that after first season

[15:10:00.0000] <annevk>
LOST but I was going for no caps

[15:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
I have never seen it but I thought the general consensus was that the writers had gone "fuck we can do whatever we want and they will kep watching this shit" around season 2

[15:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah

[15:14:00.0000] <annevk>
it had a lot of highlights for me, but the wrapping up of it utterly failed

[15:15:00.0000] <volkmar>
Hixie: ping

[15:15:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Time travel is always a bad sign

[15:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Not if it's in Doctor Who

[15:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Doctor Who doesn't have time travel, it just has travel that happens to use time as medium instead of space

[15:45:00.0000] <jwm>
aka time travel

[15:45:01.0000] <jwm>
:)

[15:45:02.0000] <gratz|home>
Doctor Who doesn't really exist

[15:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
He doesn't?

[15:45:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Noooo!

[15:47:00.0000] <jwm>
any plans to add saving of data uris to html 5?

[15:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Saving of data uris"?

[15:48:01.0000] <jwm>
generated data of any kind, or data uris themselves to files

[15:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: They're not really the same - if it was equivalent to travel through space then you'd never be able to meet yourself

[15:48:03.0000] <jwm>
instead of having to have a server connection to download a file

[15:48:04.0000] <jwm>
just set a mimetype to any data in javascript

[15:48:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
jwm: You can just load a data uri and then Save As, no?

[15:48:06.0000] <jwm>
I mean an actual file dialog generated from javascript

[15:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, that.  Yes, there is.  Not through data urls, though.

[15:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, I can meet myself anytime I like.

[15:49:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hello, AryehGregor.  How are you?

[15:49:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm okay, thanks for asking.

[15:49:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Travel to a mirror

[15:50:00.0000] <jwm>
TabAtkins: cool, any info in the spec?

[15:50:01.0000] <jwm>
also does anyone know about the [dropped] peer to peer provisions in html5, I know websockets got moved out

[15:50:02.0000] <jwm>
but I'd like to help if I can to add p2p to websockets

[15:50:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
The work isn't in HTML, but rather in javascript.  Check the webapps archives for File objects and similar.

[15:50:04.0000] <jwm>
a possible idea I was having were listen websockets

[15:51:00.0000] <jwm>
also adding upnp/dlna tech

[15:51:01.0000] <jwm>
but that would be browser specific

[15:51:02.0000] <jwm>
can't call it a browser anymore once we do p2p though :)

[15:51:03.0000] <jwm>
TabAtkins: cool yesterday I subscribed to the list

[15:51:04.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: That still won't let you violate causality

[15:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
whereas time travel does as long as you don't mind being attacked by special effects because of it

[15:52:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's not really important, since none of the causality violations in Dr Who have any real consequences

[15:54:00.0000] <jwm>
webworkers + file api + websockets (with listening) = freenet web :)

[15:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
A "serverless" web?

[15:54:02.0000] <jwm>
yeah

[15:54:03.0000] <jwm>
that is what I would like to help create heh

[15:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's a cool goal.

[15:55:01.0000] <jwm>
real cloud/real web

[15:55:02.0000] <jwm>
if you want to use buzzwords :)

[15:55:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Unite not good enough for you? :)

[15:55:04.0000] <jwm>
nah

[15:55:05.0000] <jwm>
unite still uses opera's servers

[15:55:06.0000] <jwm>
it's nothing more than a proxy

[15:56:00.0000] <jwm>
I'd like to get the web to where it has the least reliance on client/server communication as possible

[15:56:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's just for the hostname

[15:56:02.0000] <jwm>
you can't do peer to peer in unite 

[15:56:03.0000] <jwm>
as far as I read

[15:56:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's a cool goal that's more or less worthless in practice, because a client-server model works much better unless you're trying to evade a concerted effort by powerful but not-too-powerful enemies who are trying to systematically silence you.

[15:56:05.0000] <jwm>
AryehGregor: ie governments?

[15:56:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Pretty much.

[15:56:07.0000] <jwm>
it'd be harder than heck to filter web p2p traffic

[15:57:00.0000] <jwm>
you can't just block ports and call it a day

[15:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Particularly civilized governments that actually believe in trials and due process, rather than breaking down your door and shooting you.

[15:57:02.0000] <jwm>
you'd block a lot of legitimate traffic

[15:57:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can't just block ports with BitTorrent either.

[15:57:04.0000] <jwm>
performance of p2p can be great though

[15:57:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
In some cases, yes.  If it means that the server is on the same network as you.

[15:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you have to go over twice as much last-mile copper wire, though, it's probably slower.

[15:58:01.0000] <jwm>
I get higher throughput using torrent than I get from regular servers

[15:58:02.0000] <jwm>
yeah I'm just saying it would help relieve the reliance on central servers

[15:58:03.0000] <jwm>
not eliminate it

[15:58:04.0000] <jwm>
but that option would be there

[15:58:05.0000] <jwm>
it'd help a lot of projects that can't afford to pay for bandwidth

[15:59:00.0000] <jwm>
also I'd like to run payloads across the network

[15:59:01.0000] <jwm>
AI, scientific research stuff (kinda like folding@home or distributed.net)

[15:59:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
By letting them sneak the bandwidth away from their ISP because home connections are usually not metered.  A technical solution to a social problem.

[15:59:03.0000] <jwm>
if you had 300 million people running a browser that would be willing to let you use 10% of their cpu power/network bandwidth that'd be a powerful network

[16:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It'd also use up a ton of power for something you probably don't care about.

[16:00:01.0000] <jwm>
it'd cut down on all the advertising based revenue driven sites

[16:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Witness the school administrator who got fired for installing Folding@Home on all his school's computers.

[16:00:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Means they can't shut off and save power.

[16:01:00.0000] <jwm>
yeah but you are just bringing up negative aspects

[16:01:01.0000] <jwm>
which there are plenty

[16:01:02.0000] <jwm>
but there are already 80% of workers at most institutions looking at facebook

[16:01:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
You still need a central server that receives all requests if you want the site to be up-to-date.

[16:01:04.0000] <jwm>
using up a large majority of network bandwidth and processor power

[16:01:05.0000] <jwm>
watching youtube, etc

[16:01:06.0000] <jwm>
you can do a supernode hybrid p2p network

[16:01:07.0000] <jwm>
like gnutella

[16:01:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm being negative because peer-to-peer stuff has been tried before and has never really succeeded except for illegal activity.

[16:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The vast majority of things are client-server for a reason.

[16:02:01.0000] <jwm>
well I'd like to change that

[16:02:02.0000] <jwm>
I use p2p to download large legal files too

[16:02:03.0000] <jwm>
works nice

[16:02:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can't change the reasons for why most things are client-server, because they're good reasons.

[16:02:05.0000] <jwm>
why not argue the other side if you want to be unbiased

[16:02:06.0000] <jwm>
client server doesn't get rid of illegal behavior either

[16:03:00.0000] <jwm>
heck a lot of piracy happens on irc

[16:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't believe I'm especially biased (or rather, I can't tell which direction my bias lies in).  I've reached a conclusion based on my analysis of the evidence.

[16:03:02.0000] <jwm>
or usenet

[16:03:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I said P2P is mostly useful for illegal activity, not that client-server isn't also useful for that.

[16:03:04.0000] <jwm>
if you could create a web that had the capability of running your favorite app without advertising if you just let it use some of your resources

[16:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Few web sites are static, so they need to do lots of processing per request, and distributed processing is really hard, and very widely distributed processing across unreliable heterogeneous undebuggable hardware is much harder

[16:04:01.0000] <jwm>
it'd make us less reliant on information hungry companies like google 

[16:04:02.0000] <jwm>
and rather on each other

[16:04:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Distributed computing power isn't worth much.

[16:04:04.0000] <jwm>
tell that to botnets :)

[16:04:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's hard to use for general-purpose problems because of how unreliable it is.

[16:04:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Again, illegal activities.  P2P is good if you want to evade authorities, because it's hard to stamp out.

[16:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, botnets are usually controlled centrally.

[16:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
With a client-server model.

[16:05:02.0000] <jwm>
so you wouldn't want to see any p2p in your browser at all?

[16:05:03.0000] <jwm>
not even for running a webapp that could use it for benefits outside illegal activity?

[16:05:04.0000] <jwm>
I say it's worth it to let it happen

[16:05:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't care about P2P per se.  I care about concrete useful features.  I don't foresee P2P providing any for me.

[16:05:06.0000] <jwm>
let researchers give it a try

[16:05:07.0000] <jwm>
well I do

[16:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could say that about anything.  Ultimately it's about what browser implementers think they should prioritize.

[16:06:01.0000] <jwm>
I'd love to not rely on google but instead have an army of opensource engineers making apps that have tons of bandwidth or cpu activity

[16:06:02.0000] <daedb>
I already have p2p in my web browser :p

[16:06:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Problem is, that doesn't work so well.  Coordination is essential for large-scale activities.

[16:06:04.0000] <Philip`>
Bandwidth and CPU are cheap, armies of developers are expensive

[16:06:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even something like Folding@Home isn't peer-to-peer, really.  Distributed computing is different from P2P.

[16:07:00.0000] <jwm>
opensource projects are sort of loosely coupled

[16:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And yeah, usually the easy part is getting hosting.  The hard part is the actual development.

[16:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can get hosting from ads, or donated mirrors, or just personal funding unless your app is huge.

[16:07:03.0000] <jwm>
yes I know, distributed computing can be distributed in many different ways, p2p just being one of them

[16:08:00.0000] <jwm>
yeah but barring money, ads, and personal funding, and you know the first two are hard to come by typically

[16:08:01.0000] <jwm>
what if the only reason people avoid an idea is that it would cost money

[16:08:02.0000] <jwm>
to get the idea out there

[16:09:00.0000] <jwm>
Philip`: the army of developers could be the people using the network itself

[16:09:01.0000] <jwm>
just like google

[16:09:02.0000] <jwm>
google's developers aren't just the people that sit in an office all day coding

[16:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ads are very easy to come by.  They're very efficient, and will only become moreso, I suspect.

[16:09:04.0000] <jwm>
they are also the customers that visit and share their information

[16:10:00.0000] <jwm>
I think it's a really interesting distribution model that is being left out of browsers 

[16:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
jwm: Armies of people writing code and debugging it and administering the systems are expensive, then

[16:10:02.0000] <jwm>
it'll probably be here in the future

[16:10:03.0000] <Philip`>
and users aren't part of that

[16:11:00.0000] <jwm>
networks are getting faster, computers are getting faster

[16:11:01.0000] <jwm>
it's a waste not to have access to all those resources 

[16:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me notes that the majority of countries where internet access is becoming commonplace don't have very quick internet access

[16:12:00.0000] <jwm>
yes but there are still 100s of millions of people with fast internet

[16:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You're conflating distributed computing and peer-to-peer networking again.

[16:12:02.0000] <jwm>
it'll just get better

[16:12:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Distributed computing isn't very useful for most tasks, because it's unreliable and high-latency.

[16:12:04.0000] <jwm>
I don't have the two confused, I am just exposing what I am interested in

[16:12:05.0000] <jwm>
I'm interested in p2p and distributed computing

[16:13:00.0000] <jwm>
ibm's grid computing 

[16:14:00.0000] <jwm>
I'm in the communications field and go into a lot of homes.. tons of people use p2p

[16:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
jwm: Networks and computers are getting faster meaning they're going to no longer be the bottlenecks in developing a system, except in special cases like large file transfers or large numerical computations

[16:14:02.0000] <jwm>
that's more reason to incorporate it into the web

[16:15:00.0000] <jwm>
even more people would be using it if it was as simple as a javascript call in some library set

[16:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, well, good luck.  But it's not going to happen.  It makes much more organizational sense to have computation centralized.

[16:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If anything, the trend du jour is the opposite -- cloud computing.

[16:16:02.0000] <jwm>
for some things it does

[16:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Few things.  Mostly, as I said and as simple observation confirms, illegal things.

[16:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(which isn't necessarily a criticism, since there are unreasonable laws, particularly in some countries)

[16:17:01.0000] <jwm>
if you don't have a revenue model I don't think you should be without full access to the web

[16:17:02.0000] <jwm>
well I would like to actually bring non illegal activity to p2p heh

[16:17:03.0000] <jwm>
but ok, you're against p2p

[16:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you don't have money, there are a lot of things you can't do.  No way around that.

[16:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not against it, just skeptical of the claims that it's broadly useful or likely to take off.

[16:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's had decades to take off, and hasn't.

[16:18:02.0000] <jwm>
well we don't know until we try on the web 

[16:18:03.0000] <jwm>
yeah it has, but then again, for illegal activity

[16:18:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why would the web be qualitatively different from all the other places P2P has been tried?

[16:18:05.0000] <gsnedders>
It could've worked fine on a larger scale on the web by just, e.g., integrating BitTorrent clients into web browsers

[16:18:06.0000] <jwm>
because the web doesn't require you to install additional applications or setup ports

[16:18:07.0000] <jwm>
it's more accessible

[16:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(Which Opera does, on desktop.)

[16:19:01.0000] <jwm>
imagine if youtube was just an app you downloaded

[16:19:02.0000] <jwm>
it'd be used by far less people

[16:20:00.0000] <jwm>
I work in communications and nearly half of my clients run p2p software heh

[16:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be used by enough people to show it's probably a useful idea

[16:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
(People used special video plugins, so it was apparent that video was useful, so it got integrated into Flash, and more people used it, and it got integrated into HTML)

[16:22:01.0000] <jwm>
though I believe video codecs shouldn't be in the browser itself

[16:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Probably a similar path would have to be taken by other technologies that haven't proved themselves yet)

[16:22:03.0000] <jwm>
heh

[16:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anyone interested in CSS flexbox, could you take a look at http://www.xanthir.com/:wih and tell me if any of the examples could use improving?

[16:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've just created pictures for everything.

[16:32:00.0000] <jwm>
cool

[16:32:01.0000] <jwm>
looks nice

[16:32:02.0000] <jwm>
kind of how jquery does its docs

[16:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's the wonder of Markdown and fairly simple styling.

[16:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me loves Markdown so much, he'd marry it if he weren't already, and it were legal to marry a technical specification.

[16:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wouldn't it be neat if browsers could parse text/markdown into a DOM natively?

[16:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It would indeed be neat.

[16:37:00.0000] <roc>
wouldn't it be neater if browses didn't have to build in support for everyone's favourite markup language?

[16:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
probably also a security hole

[16:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
browsers certainly don't *have* to

[16:39:00.0000] <jwm>
you can just a javascript component :)

[16:39:01.0000] <jwm>
load*

[16:39:02.0000] <Rik`>
TabAtkins: with the changes, is it possible to have all children occupy 1/(number of children)

[16:39:03.0000] <jwm>
javascript booklet

[16:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rik`: That's the default, actually.  width:auto makes everyone have width:1fl, which distributes all space evenly.

[16:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rik`: If you're using padding and border and such, just pair that with a box-sizing:border-box too.

[16:41:00.0000] <Rik`>
even if one child has more text inside than the medium width ?

[16:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
jwm: I already made a js script that parses <pre>[[csv here]]</pre> into a table, so doing markdown is definitely possible too.

[16:41:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rik`: Yes, it doesn't pay attention to the contents unless it has to.

[16:41:03.0000] <Rik`>
cool

[16:41:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rik`: Like if you do width:calc(fit-content+1fl)

[16:42:00.0000] <Rik`>
that was something I couldn't do when I tried with webkit

[16:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
webkit's flexbox impl is kinda broken anyway.

[16:45:00.0000] <jwm>
I'd never heard of flexbox

[16:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jwm: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox is the current draft, which Firefox mostly implements and Webkit somewhat less implements.  I'm rewriting it right now.

[16:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Don't really bother yourself reading the current draft. Just read mine.  It's easier to understand.)

[16:48:01.0000] <Rik`>
any known effort for other layout modules ?

[16:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
After I'm done with Flexbox I'll be tackling Template Layout.

[16:50:00.0000] <Rik`>
oh cool !

[16:51:00.0000] <jwm>
will this allow for proper vertical positioning? :)

[16:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jwm: You can do proper vertical positioning with this, yeah.  Proper abspos centering using flexes is a near-future goal too.  ^_^

[16:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<div display:flex><div margin:1fl>I'm centered!</div></div>

[16:52:02.0000] <jwm>
ohh nice

[16:52:03.0000] <jwm>
tears of joy here

[16:52:04.0000] <jwm>
it'll only be IE 21 until it is implemented to standards though

[16:52:05.0000] <Rik`>
right now, you have box-pack and box-align, right ?

[16:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rik`: No, those are dropped in favor of directly using flex units.

[16:53:01.0000] <Rik`>
when I say right now, I meant in browsers

[16:53:02.0000] <jwm>
I never liked using em in browsers

[16:54:00.0000] <jwm>
I'm actually trying to come up with some html5/jquery inspired web designs right now

[16:54:01.0000] <jwm>
to use for clients

[16:54:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rik`: Yeah, right now the current draft is implemented in FF and webkit.

[16:54:03.0000] <jwm>
I'd like to make stuff scale

[16:54:04.0000] <jwm>
where the entire design scales to the window size

[16:54:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
So box-pack and box-align must be used.

[16:56:00.0000] <Rik`>
TabAtkins: Alternately, you may use flex in the display property, which is equivalent to declaring block flex

[16:57:00.0000] <Rik`>
declaring block flex ?

[16:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rik`: Sorry, that's a leak from my "split display" proposal.

[16:57:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Where display becomes a shorthand for display-outside and display-inside.

[16:57:03.0000] <Rik`>
I did get that, I didn't get the block: flex part

[16:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, no, I meant "display:block flex"

[16:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Let me go revise that.

[16:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Better now?


2010-05-25
[17:00:00.0000] <Rik`>
yep, thanks

[17:11:00.0000] <Rik`>
TabAtkins: In 3, "then the first child of placed against the left edge of the flexbox's content area" first child IS placed ?

[17:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup, fixed.

[17:20:00.0000] <figaroo>
Hi everyone!

[17:20:01.0000] <Rik`>
TabAtkins: in 5, the text under the first example is marked as an example

[17:26:00.0000] <figaroo>
Does HTML5 support the /> syntax? For example, <br/>

[17:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rik`: Fixed.

[17:26:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
figaroo: For void elements (ones that don't have end tags, like <br>) you can use the <br/> syntax too, if you want.

[17:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But non-void element like <p>, <div>, etc. can't be self-closed, even if they're empty.  So you can't do <div/>.

[17:27:01.0000] <figaroo>
Okay.

[17:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Basically, the / is always ignored in HTML.)

[17:27:03.0000] <figaroo>
That was the question I was leading up to.

[17:28:00.0000] <figaroo>
Why is it that HTML5 didn't add the ability to close a tag with />, that is, <div/>

[17:28:01.0000] <figaroo>
?

[17:28:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
figaroo: Because no existing browser supports that for HTML, so if you tried to do so it would break your page in all current browsers.

[17:29:00.0000] <figaroo>
oh

[17:29:01.0000] <figaroo>
So it's not backwards compatible, I get it.

[17:29:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, the current behavior is what everyone already does.

[17:29:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Of course, if you serve your HTML as application/xml, you can self-close, because that's valid XML.

[17:30:00.0000] <figaroo>
oh

[17:30:01.0000] <figaroo>
So this is supported in XHTML, right?

[17:30:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[17:30:03.0000] <figaroo>
As long as you send it with the application/xml MIME?

[17:30:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
As long as you're actually serving XML, not HTML that you're trying to pretend is XHTML.  ^_^

[17:30:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[17:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anything sent with text/html is HTML, full stop.  You can't serve XHTML with text/html.

[17:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Though you can do some XHTML-ish things, like self-close your void elements, even in the HTML syntax.)

[17:32:00.0000] <figaroo>
by "even in the HTML syntax" you mean "even if you serve it with text/html"?

[17:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[17:32:02.0000] <figaroo>
Oh.

[17:32:03.0000] <figaroo>
How do you do that?

[17:32:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
You serve HTML in the HTML syntax when you send it as text/html, and in the XHTML syntax when you send it as application/xml.

[17:33:00.0000] <figaroo>
Yes, I'm aware of that. However, can you send an XHTML document with text/html and still have the browser recognize the /> closing syntax?

[17:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, sorry.  Yeah, that's what I was just mentioning.  HTML ignores the / if you're using the HTML syntax, so you can do <br/> and still be okay.

[17:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Because it's the same as just writing "<br>".)

[17:36:00.0000] <figaroo>
Yea, the point I'm trying to make is, can you make <div/> syntax.

[17:37:00.0000] <figaroo>
Because, sometimes I want to create an empty div, and the easiest way to do that is <div/>

[17:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
No.  In HTML syntax, the / is always ignored.  Saying "<div/>" is always identical to "<div>".  HTML doesn't *really* allow the self-closing syntax, it just ignores certain uses of it.  If you want real self-closing you have to use XML.

[17:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And <div></div> isn't that much more difficult than <div/>.  ^_^

[17:40:00.0000] <figaroo>
it's not as difficult, however it seems cleaner, IMO.

[17:40:01.0000] <figaroo>
So if I serve an XHTML Transitional doc with the text/html MIME, will browsers understand <div/>?

[17:40:02.0000] <daedb>
No.

[17:40:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
No.  If you serve it with text/html, it's HTML.  Always and forever.

[17:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All browsers have always treated pages as plain HTML when served as text/html.  If we changed that for some reason, 90%+ of the "xhtml web" would immediately break with parsing errors.

[17:41:01.0000] <figaroo>
Ok, cause you said you can do XHTML-like things in HTML even if you serve text/html. I'm assuming you ment that you can do <br/> in HTML.

[17:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
figaroo: Yeah, just little things like that, which are harmless and browsers already do.

[17:42:01.0000] <figaroo>
Yea, I read somewhere that XHTML docs on the web aren't "really" XHTML, because they don't change the MIME to application/xml.

[17:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Harmless because <br>, <meta>, <link>, etc already don't have an end tag, so using a syntax that says "I'm going to omit this element's end tag" is harmless.)

[17:42:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't <br></br> actually <br><br>?

[17:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: Yes.

[17:43:01.0000] <Dashiva>
So not 100% harmless

[17:43:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But that's an additional special rule, on top of any self-closing concerns.

[17:43:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: Treating them as self-closing is harmless.  Trying to un-self-close them isn't.  ^_^

[17:44:00.0000] <figaroo>
In XHTML, the browser is suppose to quite executing the document if it has errors?

[17:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, my bad

[17:44:02.0000] <figaroo>
or is that only for Strict XHTML?

[17:44:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I didn't read carefully enough

[17:44:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
figaroo: That's how XML works.  The fabled "draconian error handling".

[17:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is, imo, the primary reason why XML is still a failure on the web, and will continue to be for the forseeable future.

[17:46:00.0000] <figaroo>
Oh

[17:46:01.0000] <figaroo>
what if there was a more unobtrusive way to handle errors

[17:47:00.0000] <figaroo>
like, the page could continue to run, but dispatch an error to the console or something.

[17:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Sort of like... HTML?

[17:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then you'd have HTML, more or less.  (There'd be some differences, obviously, but fairly minor.)

[17:47:03.0000] <figaroo>
HTML logs errors in the console?

[17:47:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, but it recovers gracefully from errors.  That's the important bit.

[17:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Current browsers don't, but there's nothing preventing them from doing so

[17:48:01.0000] <figaroo>
Yea, the important bit, but the other bit would be nice.

[17:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Go file bugs on browsers.  They can do that if they want right now.  ^_^

[17:48:03.0000] <figaroo>
Is it in the standards though?

[17:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Doesn't need to be.  It's UI.

[17:49:01.0000] <figaroo>
If it mentioned in the standards to do so, I'm sure the browser makers would be more inclind to implement it.

[17:49:02.0000] <Dashiva>
HTML5 defines what a parse error is

[17:49:03.0000] <Dashiva>
The rest is UI

[17:49:04.0000] <figaroo>
Oh

[17:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Whether a browser logs errors or not has no effect on whether a page displays correctly, so we don't care about it for web standards.

[17:50:01.0000] <daedb>
Maybe someone could make an extension for logging parse errors in the console?

[17:50:02.0000] <figaroo>
That's what I meant to ask; Does the standard mention the different errors.

[17:50:03.0000] <figaroo>
but ok

[17:50:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
daedb: You'd have to hook too low.  Or run your own parser over the source.

[17:50:05.0000] <figaroo>
Yea

[17:51:00.0000] <figaroo>
I think firebug in firefox logs html and css errors, but I can't remember

[17:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
For now, though, validators do the job of reporting parse errors.

[17:51:02.0000] <daedb>
TabAtkins: Ok, just a late night idea anyway. I don't know much about how the extensions work :)

[17:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
daedb: I dunno, maybe it's possible.  I don't know much about how they work either.  ^_^

[18:02:00.0000] <figaroo>
HTML5 spec defines the video element right?

[18:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
figaroo: Yes

[18:05:01.0000] <figaroo>
k

[18:06:00.0000] <figaroo>
I noticed that Chrome doesn't currently fully support the buffered media property for video/audio.

[18:06:01.0000] <figaroo>
Is that because it's new in the spec?

[18:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
figaroo: Yeah, we just haven't fully implemented the latest changes.

[18:20:00.0000] <figaroo>
We?

[18:21:00.0000] <figaroo>
Are you apart of the chrome team?

[18:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[18:25:00.0000] <jwm>
we're all apart of the chrome team!

[18:25:01.0000] <jwm>
using beta software >:)

[18:25:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Chromium team, for you.  ^_^

[18:25:03.0000] <jwm>
hah

[18:27:00.0000] <figaroo>
so everyone here in this IRC is from the chrome team? O.o

[18:27:01.0000] <figaroo>
except me*

[18:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, most of them are from Opera.  ^_^

[18:27:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
jwm was joking about how, if you use Chromium, you can count yourself a contributor to Chrome.

[18:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Most of the active people in the room are from one of the browser vendors, though.

[18:30:00.0000] <jwm>
I'm just a loon with impossible goals

[18:41:00.0000] <figaroo>
I was wondering. When the user scrubs ahead of what's currently buffered, a new buffer is added to the TimeRange (correct me if I'm wrong in any of this). Is the old buffer still accessable for playback?

[18:47:00.0000] <roc>
figaroo: it is if it's still in the 'buffered' TimeRagnes

[18:48:00.0000] <figaroo>
still? Is there ever a situation when a range gets removed from the 'buffered'?

[18:49:00.0000] <roc>
sure

[18:49:01.0000] <roc>
the browser can discard data from its buffer at any time

[18:51:00.0000] <figaroo>
ok

[18:52:00.0000] <figaroo>
so if it is still within the buffered attribute can playback be set without there being any need for re-buffering?

[18:57:00.0000] <figaroo>
This is what I'm trying to ask. What happens when a previous buffer range starts to play again; Does the UA buffer at the end of the range till it reaches the second range, and then concatenates the two ranges into larger range?

[19:22:00.0000] <roc>
figaroo: that's what we'd do

[19:22:01.0000] <roc>
in fact that's what we do do already

[19:22:02.0000] <roc>
we just don't expose it in 'buffered' yet

[21:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
WebApps WG?

[21:04:02.0000] <nessy>
would that be the right place?

[21:05:00.0000] <nessy>
I only asked a few people personally

[21:05:01.0000] <nessy>
and I think it was discussed on whatwg mailing list, but not specifically like that

[21:05:02.0000] <nessy>
s/whatwg/public-htmlt/

[21:05:03.0000] <nessy>
sorry

[21:05:04.0000] <nessy>
I can send a similar email to public-html - I'm just trying to find the right place to get it done!

[21:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: no, I'm not complaining

[21:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't think public-html would be the optimal place anyway

[21:07:01.0000] <nessy>
where do you think it would belong?

[21:07:02.0000] <nessy>
that's what I thought...

[21:07:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think discussion on the whatwg list is the right place for now

[21:07:04.0000] <nessy>
excellent

[21:08:00.0000] <jwm>
what does nessy want to do?

[21:08:01.0000] <nessy>
adaptive HTTP streaming needs standardisation across formats, not just for H.264

[21:09:00.0000] <jwm>
cool

[21:09:01.0000] <nessy>
see email to whatwg

[21:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
nessy: what needs to be defined for it?

[21:09:03.0000] <jwm>
that's more of a container issue right?

[21:09:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe W3C needs to do some thinking about getting a group organized specifically around video

[21:09:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Apple's HTTP streaming support is an IETF Internet-Draft

[21:09:06.0000] <nessy>
no, not container - it's a protocol issue really

[21:10:00.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: indeed - and possibly Apple's HTTP streaming approach can be adopted by everyone

[21:10:01.0000] <nessy>
but right now everyone goes out and rolls their own scheme

[21:10:02.0000] <nessy>
there is no central place to have everyone get together and bang it out - test it on other formats etc

[21:11:00.0000] <jwm>
welcome to the web :)

[21:11:01.0000] <jwm>
I keep trying to get people together for project work

[21:11:02.0000] <doublec>
I think it'd take someone to bang it out then say "hey look, what do you think" and form a project around it

[21:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess it depends on the MPEG-2 container: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-03

[21:11:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me finds http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-03

[21:11:05.0000] <jwm>
never pans out

[21:11:06.0000] <jwm>
doublec is exactly right

[21:11:07.0000] <nessy>
MikeSmith: ha! that's exactly what I told Philippe 3 years ago! Video needs its own group!

[21:11:08.0000] <nessy>
MikeSmith: too many interconnected issues

[21:11:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: yeah

[21:11:10.0000] <jwm>
I think the container is what matters for streaming

[21:12:00.0000] <jwm>
matroska for example allows true streaming

[21:12:01.0000] <jwm>
aka webm :)

[21:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder why this spec is all MPEG-2 rather than MPEG-4

[21:12:03.0000] <nessy>
"true streaming" … with bitrate adaptation?

[21:13:00.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: yeah - Adobe and Microsoft did it for MPEG-4

[21:14:00.0000] <nessy>
doublec: I can do that for Ogg - and I can do that for WebM - but to get it happening across container formats needs some kind of unifying environment

[21:15:00.0000] <nessy>
it's come up in the media fragments WG incidentally

[21:15:01.0000] <roc>
why does it need to happen across container formats?

[21:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what IETF mailing list (if any) does discussion about draft-pantos-http-live-streaming take place on?

[21:17:00.0000] <nessy>
well, maybe I am too idealistic - but I would like to put a single description file on my server that every browser can interpret and do the same switch to retrieving another byte range independent of whether the container on the server is Ogg, WebM or MPEG-4, or MPEG-2 or whatever

[21:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: I can find out - Dave Singer would know

[21:18:00.0000] <nessy>

[21:19:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[21:19:04.0000] <jwm>
vacation.. must be nice

[21:19:05.0000] <roc>
nessy: I don't think there's a huge benefit to using the same scheme for all formats

[21:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I knew you would be, didn't know that Dave was as well

[21:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
he's on vacation all this week, back next week I think

figaroo: doesn't need to be

[21:34:01.0000] <figaroo>
Is it good practice to?

[21:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's parsed case insensitively

[21:34:03.0000] <figaroo>
so it doesn't matter at all

[21:34:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's not bad practice either way

[21:34:05.0000] <figaroo>
k

[21:34:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
right, doesn't matter

[21:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, figaroo: do you know what "self-raising flour" is in Swedish, and what "grease-proof paper" is

[21:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think there might be some people in the IETF hybi WG who are curious to know that answer for that now

[21:36:00.0000] <figaroo>

Wow, this is weird

[21:49:00.0000] <figaroo>
Idk if you guys talk about this, but for some reason in my javascript script has a variable called 'bar' which equals the HTML element <div id='bar'> without me setting it to equal it.

[21:49:01.0000] <figaroo>
Anyone know why that could be?

[21:50:00.0000] <figaroo>
What's going on here...

[21:51:00.0000] <figaroo>

figaroo: in IE?

[21:54:05.0000] <figaroo>
Yes

[21:54:06.0000] <figaroo>
No it's in Chrome

[21:54:07.0000] <miketaylr>
:o

[21:54:08.0000] <figaroo>
It's the weirdest thing

[21:54:09.0000] <miketaylr>
that's a pretty well known "feature" in IE

[21:55:00.0000] <roc>
I think Webkit emulates that IE quirk

[21:55:01.0000] <figaroo>
I got rid of all my javascript in my document, just kept the html, and then went into my console and type foo

[21:55:02.0000] <roc>
Gecko doesn't

[21:55:03.0000] <roc>
except in quirks mode maybe?

[21:55:04.0000] <figaroo>
and foo = document.getElementById('foo');

[21:55:05.0000] <figaroo>
Maybe I'm in quirks mode

[21:56:00.0000] <figaroo>
but I thought I set an HTML5 doctype

[21:56:01.0000] <figaroo>
lemme check

[21:56:02.0000] <jwm>
http://www.karlstanley.net/blog/?p=5

[21:56:03.0000] <roc>
yeah, we emulate it in quirks mode but not standards mode

[21:56:04.0000] <figaroo>
maybe this is an invalid html5 doctype <!DOCTYPE html>

[21:56:05.0000] <miketaylr>
interesting

[21:57:00.0000] <roc>
quite possibly Webkit emulates it in all modes

[21:57:01.0000] <figaroo>
Is <!DOCTYPE html> not a valid doctype for chrome 5.x?

[21:58:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: re: progress element, it’s in the pipeline. thanks for the info

[21:59:00.0000] <figaroo>
roc, must be the case  because my document does have an HTML5 doctype

[22:01:00.0000] <figaroo>
I even added an HTML 4 transitional doctype and it still has this behavior

[22:03:00.0000] <figaroo>
yea it emulates it.

[22:03:01.0000] <figaroo>
only if you have an id that is "awesome-video-player" there is no variable, I suppose.

[22:04:00.0000] <figaroo>
I was wondering though, why is HTML5's doctype <!doctype html> and not <!doctype html5>, it seems it would make more sense when HTML6 comes out.

[22:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
figaroo: because it's not a version indicator

[22:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
its sole purpose is to prevent document fro

[22:05:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
*documents from being parsed in quirks mode

[22:05:03.0000] <figaroo>
oh

[22:06:00.0000] <figaroo>
Why do we even have quirks mode?

[22:06:01.0000] <figaroo>
Oh wait.

[22:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
because some geniuses in the past thought it was a really keen idea

[22:06:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and now we are stuck with it for eternity

[22:06:04.0000] <figaroo>
So

[22:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and not sure what you mean about <!doctype html> being valid in chrome, but if you mean Chrome parses your doc in quirks mode even though it has that doctype, then, it should not be doing that

[22:08:00.0000] <figaroo>
how do I know if it's parsing in quirksmode or not?

[22:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
check the error console

[22:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe

[22:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I dunno

[22:09:03.0000] <figaroo>
I even tried a HTML4 transitional doctype

[22:09:04.0000] <figaroo>
and foo still equaled document.getElementById('foo');

[22:10:00.0000] <figaroo>
If newer browsers used standards mode regardless of whether or not there is a doctype, then it what would happen?

[22:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if there's not doctype, it gets parsed in quirks mode

[22:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
*no doctype

[22:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
browsers don't use standards mode for doctype-less documents

[22:11:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: ah, cool

[22:11:03.0000] <figaroo>
Yes but why are browser venders continueing this paradigm?

[22:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for bugwards compatibility with the Web

[22:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
existing content

[22:12:02.0000] <figaroo>
bugwards, lol

[22:12:03.0000] <figaroo>
hmm

[22:12:04.0000] <aho>
document.compatMode === "CSS1Compat" -> standards mode

[22:12:05.0000] <figaroo>
How many pages out there don't have a doctype?

[22:12:06.0000] <aho>
"BackCompat" -> quirks mode

[22:13:00.0000] <jwm>
figaroo: a lot

[22:13:01.0000] <jwm>
every site I've created

[22:13:02.0000] <jwm>
j/k

[22:13:03.0000] <figaroo>
well

[22:13:04.0000] <karlcow>
jwm, that compensates for all sites I created ;)

[22:13:05.0000] <figaroo>
What about older browsers that don't support the HTML5 doctype, will they render in quirksmode?

[22:14:00.0000] <aho>
it's "<!DOCTYPE html>" by the way

[22:14:01.0000] <figaroo>
aho, yes I'm aware.

[22:14:02.0000] <jwm>
don't need capitalization

[22:14:03.0000] <jwm>
:)

[22:15:00.0000] <aho>
older browser think "ah there is a doctype... and it's one i don't know... must be something new" :>

[22:15:01.0000] <aho>
so... yea, it's basically a cheat

[22:15:02.0000] <aho>
but it works

[22:15:03.0000] <aho>
i.e. they go into standards mode

[22:15:04.0000] <figaroo>
whew the web has some deep rooted issues...

[22:16:00.0000] <figaroo>
So how do we (the web community) plan on moving forward? How will we introduce new features to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while keeping keeping things backwards compatible?

[22:17:00.0000] <aho>
looking at the specs... it doesn't seem to be case insensitive

[22:19:00.0000] <aho>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/syntax.html#the-doctype <- kay... this one states it's case insensitve :>

[22:20:00.0000] <aho>
i'll continue to use uppercase tho... got autocomplete for that :>

[22:20:01.0000] <jwm>
it'll be nice if future browsers just follow standards only

[22:20:02.0000] <jwm>
:)

[22:20:03.0000] <jwm>
free up some memory

[22:20:04.0000] <jwm>
mobile web browsers shouldn't have to be backwards compatible

[22:21:00.0000] <jwm>
if following the mobile specs

[22:22:00.0000] <figaroo>
What are the major differences between quirksmode and standards mode?

[22:23:00.0000] <roc>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla_Quirks_Mode_Behavior

[22:30:00.0000] <figaroo>
What happens when we want to change HTML syntax, down the road?

[22:31:00.0000] <figaroo>
Will we need a new doctype or just a version attribute in the head element?

[22:32:00.0000] <aboodman>
MikeSmith: hallo

[22:32:01.0000] <aboodman>
oh, sory

[22:37:00.0000] <aboodman>
MikeSmith: two main differences off the top of my head. 1) Widgets are a package of HTML and related resources, while what I'm proposing is a wrapper around a URL (no resources are included). 2) Widgets are dramatically larger than what I'm proposing (more akin to Chrome or Firefox extensions).

[22:39:00.0000] <aho>
<figaroo> What are the major differences between quirksmode and standards mode? <- quirksmode is pretty random, standards mode is somewhat predictable

[22:39:01.0000] <aho>
simply put: no one wants quirks mode

[22:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
aboodman: I see

[22:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[22:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me re-reads aboodman e-mail message

[22:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
aboodman: as Dion alludes to his reply, I think the permissions mechanism and the UI around that would be a challenge to get agreement about

[22:55:00.0000] <aboodman>
MikeSmith: that isn't what I got from Dion's reply.

[22:55:01.0000] <aboodman>
/me goes to re-read Dion's reply.

[22:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
aboodman: the 2nd to last paragraph

[22:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe I'm reading too much into that

[22:57:02.0000] <aboodman>
i think at least having a common framework to work within could be a good start.

[22:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[22:58:01.0000] <aboodman>
if there is only overlap on 50% of the features, taht still gives a good base to converge from.

[22:58:02.0000] <aboodman>
heck even if there is _no_ overlap on features, if the base format is the same, that is good.

[22:58:03.0000] <aboodman>
that is the situation with browser-specific css enhancements today :)

[23:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
true, I suppose

[00:07:00.0000] <figaroo>
Do I need to use CDATA in my script tags?

[00:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: about MathML 3: Are two of Gecko, WebKit, Presto and Trident treating the presentational part of MathML 3 as something they'd tracked for implementation?

[00:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/tracked/track/

[00:12:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: no idea, but I can ask and find out

[00:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok

[00:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: were you wondering if patent evergreening applies to software?

[00:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[00:13:03.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: reading the Nero v. MPEG-LA court filing suggests that it applies

[00:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yeah, if what Nero alleges in there is accurate

[00:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
especially the bit about the claim to the Dept of Justice that they'd have at most 50-some essential patents

[00:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
when the actually ended up adding 800 or whatever

[00:15:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
for mpeg-2

[00:15:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and then 1000 or more for H.264

[00:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
iirc

[00:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: btw, I am in the process of finishing your review changes for the xml-stylesheet PI checker

[00:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I'm trying to figure out what'd be the best way to deal with the issue you pointed out about the enum I'm using to handling switching on the pseudo-attribute names

[00:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you remember I have this:

[00:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
      private enum PseudoAttrName {

[00:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
          HREF, TYPE, TITLE, MEDIA, CHARSET, ALTERNATE, INVALID;

[00:19:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
          private static PseudoAttrName toCaps(String str) {

[00:19:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
              try {

[00:19:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
                  if (!str.toLowerCase().equals(str)) {

[00:19:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
                      return INVALID;

[00:19:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
                  }

[00:19:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
                  return valueOf(str.toUpperCase());

[00:19:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
              } catch (Exception ex) {

[00:19:10.0000] <MikeSmith>
                  return INVALID;

[00:19:11.0000] <MikeSmith>
              }

[00:19:12.0000] <MikeSmith>
          }

[00:19:13.0000] <MikeSmith>
      }

[00:19:14.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, sorry for long paste

[00:19:15.0000] <MikeSmith>
that looked shorter in vim

[00:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, you'll also remember I'm doing that so that I can switch on the uppercase version of the pseudo-attribute name

[00:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
                  switch (PseudoAttrName.toCaps(attrName)) {

[00:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
                      case HREF:

[00:21:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
etc.

[00:21:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I realize that's a bit idiosyncratic

[00:21:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe just dumb

[00:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so if you have a better suggestion on how to handle the switch, I'm happy to change it

[00:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or I can just change the whole thing to use if/else-if instead

[00:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I suggests rolling your own toAsciiUpperCase

[00:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[00:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or finding one I most likely have already written elsewhere in the codebase

[00:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I remember some places where you have lowercasing ones

[00:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I'll just borrow from that

[00:25:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: does Gecko implement the presentational part of MathML, the other part (whatever it's called) or both?

[00:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me is once again finding that he wishes svn provided a way to choose only some parts of file changes in a workspace to commit

[00:55:00.0000] <nessy1>
MikeSmith: move to bzr or git or something more modern ;)

[00:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: I'm not the owner for the repository

[00:56:01.0000] <nessy>
shame! encourage them to move ;)

[00:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and even if I were, easier said than done :)

[00:56:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[00:57:00.0000] <nessy>
I've been trying to do that with W3C ppl for the last year - at least moving from cvs to svn would be nice … but I haven't had much luck :(

[00:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: W3C has an mercurial repo now

[00:57:02.0000] <nessy>
oh my

[00:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
systems team can set up you up with space there if you want

[00:58:01.0000] <nessy>
does it support everything?

[00:59:00.0000] <nessy>
I'm an editor on Media Fragments, so that's my experience with VCS of W3C

[00:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: btw, is it OK with you if I remove the static copies of validator/src/nu/validator/servlet/PageEmitter.java and validator/src/nu/validator/servlet/FormEmitter.java from the repository?

[00:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: because they are now regenerated/replaced by the build

[00:59:03.0000] <nessy>
incidentally - I'm not mercurial-fluent, so might pass on that :(

[00:59:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
nessy: it supports all whatever a default install of mercurial supports, I think

[01:00:00.0000] <nessy>
I meant all W3C specs

[01:00:01.0000] <nessy>
but it's ok - I think I'll pass - too much pain involved in learning another VCS

[01:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[01:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, spec sources for HTML WG and WebApps WG are all still in cvs on dev.w3.org

[01:01:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but we can move them eventually

[01:01:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think the HTML WG testing TF is using the mercurial repo already

[01:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: Gecko implements the presentational part only

[01:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: does the build put the generated emitters in the old .java location?

[01:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't believe there are plans to implement the non-presentational parts in WebKit

[01:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: which MathML spec are you tracking for the parts that you are implementing?

[01:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: dunno - the person working on it is a part time volunteer

[01:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yep, it puts the generated emitters in exactly the same location as the .java files

[01:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/MathML%20Goals

[01:32:01.0000] <foolip>
nessy: around?

[01:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: then I'm OK with removing the generated files from version control

[01:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ok, thanks

[01:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: so far, I don't have enough data to have an informed opinion about changing the validation target from MathML 2 to 3

[01:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
understood

[01:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but SVG 1.2 being what it is, following the spec with the highest number isn't a given

[01:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll do some more asking

[01:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
roger that too

[01:49:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know what the differences between 2 and 3 are

[01:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: as I mentioned my concern about MathML is just that based on what I've seen of that existing (third-party) MathML 2.0 schema, it's highly likely to have significant bugs that are waiting to be discovered

[01:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: e.g., the one I fixed in it last week was because he had a regular expression in it for checking number values for width and height, etc., values -- and the way he had it, it only accepted integer values 

[01:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so it leads me to wonder how closely dude actually has read the MathML 2.0 spec

[01:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I suspect the answer is, not too closely

[01:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I wonder if I could convince the MathML WG to produce an RNC schema for MathML 2.0

[02:02:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i bet there is more technical feedback on websockets in whatwg than on hybi

[02:02:01.0000] <boblet>
anyone worked out how to fire CSS3 transitions on :hover but not :active?

[02:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me wonders what the discussion on whatwg⊙wo is supposed to be that isn't technical discussion

[02:06:00.0000] <boblet>
othermaciej: the HTML5 video for porn thread yesterday was still technical… right?

[02:08:00.0000] <annevk>
boblet, set -o-transition:0 on :active ?

[02:09:00.0000] <annevk>
(it's a guess)

[02:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: fwiw, I finally committed the xml-stylesheet PI-checking code to the v.nu repo today

[02:10:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: yay

[02:13:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: that’s what I thought. hmm, browser support is patchy. Opera 10.5 appears good tho

[02:13:01.0000] <boblet>
ta

[02:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: here's a real-world test case http://home.arcor.de/martin.honnen/operaBugs/op9/XML/ampersandInPI2.xml

[02:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: but the validator just complains about the root element's namespace and refuses to validate :(

[02:17:00.0000] <annevk>
/me goes to verify his guess

[02:17:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: oh the checking isn't live yet on v.nu

[02:19:00.0000] <annevk>
boblet, it's undefined though I think if Opera does what you say it does it should be defined as such as nothing else is really logical

[02:19:01.0000] <annevk>
boblet, see http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#starting

[02:20:00.0000] <boblet>
I looked there for stopping actually :)

[02:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: yeah, it won't be live until the next time hsivonen deploys

[02:20:02.0000] <boblet>
annevk: making a matrix atm

[02:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I also need to fix an enum I added to the MediaQuery.java datatype code

[02:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
to do proper ascii uppercasing

[02:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I note the you have a somewhat different method for doing the lowercasing there

[02:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in https://whattf.svn.cvsdude.com/syntax/trunk/relaxng/datatype/java/src/org/whattf/datatype/AbstractDatatype.java

[02:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
toAsciiLowerCase using a CASE_MASK bitmap

[02:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: the CASE_MASK thing is just complexity compared to plus/minus

[02:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[02:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so OK if I simplify it?

[02:26:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is, use the same method you're using in the htmlparser code?

[02:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
newAsciiLowerCaseStringFromString

[02:28:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: doesn’t work with -o-transition:0 on :active (transitions on mouseover/out, but also mouseup), but does with -o-transition-property: none (only on mouseover/out as desired)

[02:29:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: webkit has the ‘also mouseup’ behaviour on both -webkit-transition:0 and -webkit-transition-property:none, so it’s all transitions or no transitions it seems

[02:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yes, it's OK to simplify it

[02:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
htanks

[02:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: http://usa10.webdirections.org/program looks borked

[02:33:00.0000] <boblet>
woah, you’re not wrong

[02:34:00.0000] <boblet>
wonder who’s in charge of that. will let ppls know, thanks

[02:35:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm, chrome's view source of http://home.arcor.de/martin.honnen/operaBugs/op9/XML/ampersandInPI2.xml is lying

[02:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: hmm, yeah

[02:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Safari shows it correctly, afaict

[02:37:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
chrome also screws up if the last thing in source is </script>

[02:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
nessy: If you can deal with Git, MErcurial is a walk in the park

[02:55:00.0000] <boblet>
the spec used to mention footnotes as a use for aside element, and doesn’t anymore. any reason why? still kosher?

[02:55:01.0000] <boblet>
(if anyone knows :)

[02:57:00.0000] <boblet>
aah np, I found 4.13.3

[03:00:00.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: i added a patch for the bug 721, please check it out

[03:00:01.0000] <Yudai>
Mike seems offline now

[03:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: The patch looks OK if it's a good idea not to report data: URLs with fragments as errors

[03:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: however, considering that data: URLs with fragments don't actually work in browsers, I think it's useful to report them as errors

[03:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if that position can't be backed by specs, at minimum the validator should emit a warning telling authors not to use fragments in data: URLs.

[03:07:01.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: I'm not sure whether the browsers' behavior is "by design" or just a bug

[03:07:02.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: if it is by design, it is useful to report as errors, i think

[03:07:03.0000] <jgraham>
Where does the spec define what type the events have e.g. how do you work out what to pass as typeArg to initHashChangeEvent?

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: I suspect in Gecko's case it was a bug

[03:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
bugs have a tendency to be promoted to design on the Web, though

[03:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
best way to reduce the number of bugs

[03:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wish we had a well-functioning spec group for URLs for determining what's a bug and what's a feature here

[03:10:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i've found myself wanting a URL spec surprisingly often in the past few months

[03:10:01.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: some people believe that the validator is always right and same as the specs. so if we report it as error, we should change the message

[03:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: ideally, the validator matches the spec and the spec makes sense in light of the browser implementations

[03:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me looks up the data: URL spec

[03:11:02.0000] <roc>
I thought that fragments were an HTTP-specific thing

[03:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: the fragment isn't resolved by the HTTP stack, so it doesn't really make sense for it to be HTTP-specific

[03:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: it seems to me the data: RFC disagrees with the RFC you are citing

[03:14:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: possibly a bug in the data: RFC

[03:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: anyway, I think the validator should match the spec

[03:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: and if the spec is bad, the spec should be changed

[03:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: here, it seems that there are contradictory specs

[03:15:03.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: i agree with you

[03:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: so I'd be inclined to using the spec that comes with results that are closer to the real world

[03:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: which currently is the data: RFC not speccing fragment ids for data: at all

[03:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(which does seem like a bad oversight)

[03:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: I'd be OK with taking the patch if it emitted an error whining something more specific about fragments in data:

[03:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: I could also be persuaded into turning it into a warning instead of an error

[03:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: but I'd rather keep it an error until the spec closer to the subject matter (data: spec) and the browsers are changed

[03:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the applicability of generic URI syntax as defined by the IETF to all URLs is a fiction anyway

[03:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
consider javascript:

[03:20:02.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: yes

[03:21:00.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: it makes sense

[03:21:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
javascript: is the exception confirming the rule ;)

[03:21:02.0000] <Yudai>
personally, i'd like to use #frag with data: url, so i prefer warning :)

[03:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me thinks it's good to be able to use fragments with data: urls

[03:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: would you like to use #frag before it actually works in URL consumers?

[03:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I'd like to be able to use #frag in data: URLs, too, in the sense of having Gecko, WebKit, etc. changed to allow it)

[03:23:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: are there bugs about changing checko and webkit?

[03:23:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
s/c/g/

[03:23:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
s/h//

[03:24:00.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: the validator can not only follow the other consumers but also run at the head of them, i think

[03:24:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
typo++

[03:24:02.0000] <roc>
I would love to have that feature

[03:25:00.0000] <roc>
really useful for stuff like filter: url(data:...#filter);

[03:25:01.0000] <Yudai>
and i believe validators should be stricter than the others

[03:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: how much to let the validator be "ahead" is a tough call

[03:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: especially with wrong directions of where "ahead" is--like SVG 1.2

[03:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: I don't know about bug reports

[03:27:00.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: hmm, it's a difficult problem

[03:28:00.0000] <Yudai>
ok, keep it as errors and show another message for users

[03:29:00.0000] <Yudai>
which is like "RFC2397 and RFC3986 are conflicted in this point"

[03:30:00.0000] <Yudai>
my wish is to let the users know  a right knowledge

[03:31:00.0000] <Yudai>
if we don't give users information, they might believe it is a simple error

[03:41:00.0000] <asmodai>
I'm sure you guys saw http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/a-new-type-of-phishing-attack/ ?

[03:45:00.0000] <Yudai>
hsivonen: i added a new patch

[03:50:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100525#l-499 - it's specced in html5

[03:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
here http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete/browsers.html#named-access-on-the-window-object

[04:11:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: nice work on the MathML stuff

[04:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: MikeSmith's work, probably

[04:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Yudai: thanks. I sent you email about the patch.

[04:44:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: Still nice ^^

[05:44:00.0000] <boblet>
anyone want to talk about figure and the “is typically referenced as a single unit” mention in the spec?

[05:45:00.0000] <boblet>
I’m wondering if the presentational (something-with-caption) will trump the “that could, without affecting the flow of the document, be moved away from that primary content” part of the spec

[05:47:00.0000] <boblet>
thinking about it I’ve used figure for it’s caption even when the content contained would have made the main article hard to understand if it was moved to a different page — the surrounding text wouldn’t provide enough information to cover the figure content not being there

[05:48:00.0000] <daedb>
boblet: I always thought of the "could be moved away" part of <figure> as an optional nicety that works some figures, but not all figures.

[05:49:00.0000] <boblet>
daedb: I’m starting to think that the “could be moved away” part is the nub, and the “typically referenced” part is the optional nicety. certainly seems like it’s more literary than captioning

[05:50:00.0000] <boblet>
aaw mike, you just missed my deep semantic philosophical question

[05:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
boblet: I think you are over thinking it

[05:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: darn

[05:50:03.0000] <jgraham>
<figure> is for things that are referenced as figures

[05:50:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me checks the logs

[05:51:00.0000] <boblet>
jgraham: is it possible to *over*-think semantics!?

[05:51:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: hehe

[05:51:02.0000] <jgraham>
boblet: Sure

[05:51:03.0000] <boblet>
/me should have added a :| to that comment huh

[05:51:04.0000] <jgraham>
When the maount of thought you put in is disproportionately high compared to the value

[05:51:05.0000] <jgraham>
*amount

[05:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
The bar for that is actually quite low becase semantics are only useful if someone else understands them

[05:52:01.0000] <boblet>
jgraham: when you say “referenced as figures”, you mean there should be a link in the text saying “ bla bla (see Fig 2.7) bla”, right?

[05:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think jgraham is right

[05:52:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
about over thinking it

[05:52:04.0000] <jgraham>
boblet: Yeah. But that's not really a necessary condition

[05:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think in some cases, you may be putting more thought into the wording than Hixie did when he wrote it

[05:53:01.0000] <asmodai>
MikeSmith: I hear you are to be blamed for the mathml stuff for the validator according to hsivonen. Thanks ^^

[05:53:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
kind of like, Blessed are the cheesemakers

[05:53:03.0000] <boblet>
heh

[05:53:04.0000] <daedb>
It's going to be commonly used without proper figure references anyway, so saying it should only be used that way is pointless.

[05:53:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
asmodai: not sure what you mean

[05:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway, to copntinue my previous point, for the general web case the value of the semantics is typically "will this be processed in a useful way by a general-purpose UA"

[05:54:01.0000] <daedb>
/me checks what the spec actually says...

[05:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
asmodai: if you mean the mathml integration into text/html validation, that is completely the work of hsivonen himself

[05:54:03.0000] <boblet>
the article that’s making me wonder is the one I wrote on ruby: http://html5doctor.com/ruby-rt-rp-element/#without-rp

[05:54:04.0000] <asmodai>
/me wonders why hsivonen mentioned you then

[05:54:05.0000] <jgraham>
Although there is also some value in "am I making it easy for people to write specialised screen scrapers"

[05:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
asmodai: maybe because I had earlier today been talking here about a couple bugs in the MathML schema that I fixed recently

[05:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
but that's not semantics as much as consistency, and exposing the right parts in elements

[05:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
asmodai: but those were relatively minor changes

[05:56:01.0000] <asmodai>
Oh ok

[05:56:02.0000] <boblet>
all of the groups of images followed by some italic text are figures, so I used figure a lot

[05:56:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: I think element semantics are a massive gray area, and much of the decisions come down to judgment calls

[05:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
(so <dt>title: <dd>Foo is mildlybetter than just <span>title: foo</span> because it is easier to find the markup corresponding to the title and the value of the title

[05:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
)

[05:57:02.0000] <boblet>
the article wouldn’t be so informative with the figure elements moved to a different page, fror example

[05:58:00.0000] <boblet>
/me wonders if he’s the only one that really enjoys a good natter about semantics

[05:59:00.0000] <boblet>
so using figure as a way to just add a caption to an image (even if it’s not referenced in the main text) is still cool huh

[05:59:01.0000] <boblet>
thanks for the input all

[06:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: I think a lot of people do care about clear guidance around semantics

[06:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
which is why you should keep writing Doctor stuff about for

[06:00:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
*about it

[06:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: btw, I wish the other doctors would come here and hang out on IRC more

[06:01:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: I’m having a conversation with someone about that ‘confusing elements of HTML5’ flowchart thing, and he’s saying figure is tangental and must be referenced

[06:02:00.0000] <boblet>
so I’m just wanting to make sure I’m on the right path

[06:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: talk to two different people and you are likely to get two different opinions

[06:02:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think much of it is subjective

[06:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and anybody who claims otherwise is confused themselves

[06:03:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: will mention it. I think that between the two (possibly three) books, event organisation, speaking appearances and workshops everyone is doing (not to mention two are expecting), they don’t have much time for the jollities of this channel

[06:03:02.0000] <boblet>
yeah, thought so

[06:03:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
bullshit

[06:03:04.0000] <boblet>
har

[06:04:00.0000] <boblet>
will have a stern talking to them then ;-)

[06:04:01.0000] <daedb>
The spec says that figures *could* be moved away, not that it must always be movable. At least that's how I interpret it :)

[06:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think plenty of people on this channel are just as busy

[06:04:03.0000] <boblet>
daedb: yeah me too

[06:05:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: well, I’m here

[06:05:01.0000] <boblet>
>_<

[06:05:02.0000] <annevk>
"no time" just means "not interested enough right now"

[06:05:03.0000] <boblet>
doh!

[06:05:04.0000] <boblet>
＞＿＜

[06:05:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: yeah, you are leading by example

[06:05:06.0000] <boblet>
nya nya, doublebyte on yo’ emoticon ass

[06:05:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
and the jollities of the channel mask the fact that a lot of seriously important discussion takes place here

[06:06:00.0000] <boblet>
actually @rem has two books on the go himself

[06:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: But all we talk about here is the Swedish for baking paper

[06:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: often it's discussion that would burn up a lot of e-mail time otherwise

[06:06:03.0000] <jgraham>
I read it on the IETF mailing list so it must be true

[06:06:04.0000] <boblet>
true true, I’ve been here for a couple of big spec changes

[06:07:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm not sure what point he was trying to make

[06:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
(And the fact that I spent a good deal of the day before talking about WebSockets here is obviously irrelevant)

[06:07:02.0000] <annevk>
but whatever, I'm pretty much done with hybi

[06:07:03.0000] <jgraham>
The point he made to me is "my email should be ignored"

[06:07:04.0000] <jgraham>
Dunno if that is what he was aiming for

[06:08:00.0000] <annevk>
those guys there are full of petty arguments

[06:08:01.0000] <annevk>
i guess that's what hybi is mostly useful for

[06:08:02.0000] <annevk>
a wide selection of petty arguments

[06:09:00.0000] <annevk>
god knows there's never enough of those

[06:10:00.0000] <annevk>
on another note, I think I'll add addMediumListener / removeMediumListener to CSSOM View now

[06:10:01.0000] <annevk>
nobody complained about the email for over two weeks; lets see what a draft brings out

[06:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I can see why the IETF guys might be unhappy if a spec they don't want is being nominally developed in an IETF WG

[06:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but if they don't want it there, perhaps they should have allowed it to proceed in the W3C!

[06:11:01.0000] <annevk>
there's no "they" though

[06:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[06:11:03.0000] <annevk>
much like there's no "us"

[06:12:00.0000] <annevk>
the app director convinced the W3C domain lead to do it at the IETF and that was it

[06:12:01.0000] <annevk>
I don't think much more thinking went into the whole thing

[06:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
considering that the W3C has a serious patent policy and the IETF hasn't moving stuff from the W3C to the IETF seems bad

[06:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess wanting to have any and all protocols in the IETF is the same issue as wanting to have any and all Web document formats at the W3C

[06:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
Isn't there some historic agreement that W3C wants to honour in order to avoid ploitical battles?

[06:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
*political

[06:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah

[06:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but it seems the issue still is keeping up the appearance that if you want to make a protocol, the IETF is the place to go

[06:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
see http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/08/23/overton-window

[06:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
sliding the window to #5

[06:16:03.0000] <hsivonen>
except with IETF instead of the W3C

[06:49:00.0000] <annevk>
aah crap

[06:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: ?

[06:51:00.0000] <annevk>
HTML5 has MediaError

[06:51:01.0000] <annevk>
CSSOM has MediaList

[06:52:00.0000] <annevk>
I need MediaCallback / MediaChange for CSSOM View

[06:52:01.0000] <annevk>
it makes sense to call them MediaCallback and MediaChange given MediaList

[06:52:02.0000] <annevk>
but not given MediaError

[06:53:00.0000] <annevk>
I suppose I could call them MediaQueryCallback and MediaQueryChange and hope future media query related interfaces stay clear of the prefix Media

[06:53:01.0000] <annevk>
I think I'll go with that

[06:56:00.0000] <annevk>
it's pretty clear this stuff was not designed with vision

[06:57:00.0000] <annevk>
media can mean video/audio, resource type, or rendering type

[06:58:00.0000] <annevk>
and now it all comes together years downstream and we've to patch it up

[07:14:00.0000] <akamike>
boblet: you said there would be nurses :(

[07:14:01.0000] <boblet>
akamike in da house! the challenge has been answered

[07:15:00.0000] <boblet>
heh, bait n switch yo

[07:16:00.0000] <boblet>
akamike: oh any thoughts on what it was about aside that Rich wanted improved?

[07:17:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: damned English having the same word for different things

[07:19:00.0000] <akamike>
Yes, though I haven't had a chance to send them around yet

[07:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
is akamike and HTML5 doctor?

[07:19:02.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: indeedy

[07:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there goes the neighborhood

[07:20:01.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: oh, you better make with the hawt nurses you promised

[07:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[07:20:03.0000] <akamike>
:D

[07:20:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
akamike: glad you are here

[07:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you have found the right place

[07:22:00.0000] <akamike>
Happy to be here, I have stopped by a couple of times before but not for very long

[09:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://forums.whatwg.org/viewtopic.php?t=4309 - anyone remember why workers resolve urls against the worker script's url instead of the document's url?

[09:06:00.0000] <annevk>
for the same reason background image URLs in CSS are resolved against the style sheet rarther than the document they are associated with?

[09:07:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
but workers are scripts

[09:07:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
scripts in <script> use the document's url

[09:07:02.0000] <annevk>
can't a worker be shared?

[09:07:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
ah

[09:07:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
yes, that's probably why

[09:08:00.0000] <annevk>
for scripts it makes sense I think, especially when they mutate the DOM... but yeah

[09:08:01.0000] <annevk>
people should use a trailing slash

[09:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
trailing slash?

[09:14:00.0000] <annevk>
a leading

[09:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
yeah. works poorly for local testing but then again the whole origin policy also works poorly for local testing

[09:18:00.0000] <annevk>
local testing is still done? I guess you could configure a server of some kind

[09:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
another fwiw about v.nu changes: I finally also committed code for checking text content of style elements

[09:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
another thing that'd been sitting in my workspace for a long time

[09:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
(pending me getting around to finshing changes from review comments from Henri)

[09:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
all it does is check to make sure any "<!--" in a style text content has a matching "-->"

[09:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I also have half of a patch for <script> element text-content checking written up

[09:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe I can finish that this week

[10:14:00.0000] <chris_7>
hi all

[10:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
hi

[10:19:00.0000] <chris_7>
Just started with html using emacs nxml (http://github.com/hober/html5-el).  Right direction?  Or is there a better environment on linux?

[10:19:01.0000] <chris_7>
html5 not just html

[10:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Shrug.  I just use a text editor for my html authoring.

[10:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
chris_7: That tool is great if you are creating something that is going to be servedc as application/xhtml+xml it might get you in trouble otherwise

[10:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: What is emacs if not a text editor?

[10:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
Waht, bad question

[10:24:04.0000] <jgraham>
*Wait

[10:24:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Exactly.

[10:24:06.0000] <jgraham>
But still there is nothing wrong with using emacs for HTML editing

[10:24:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Perhaps I should say I use *just* a text editor.

[10:25:00.0000] <chris_7>
jgraham, well it's going to be used in an effort to write for websockets

[10:25:01.0000] <jgraham>
Actually the problemn is that the default HTML mode is too sucky

[10:25:02.0000] <jwm>
I use the text editor on the other end of the war lines from emacs

[10:25:03.0000] <jwm>
:)

[10:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
Someone should implement a HTML5 parser in elisp and use that to implement syntax highlighting, indenting, etc.

[10:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
And then get embedded ja and CSS right somehow

[10:26:02.0000] <chris_7>
that would be exactly what I wanted

[10:26:03.0000] <jgraham>
*js

[10:26:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I use Notepad++, Gedit, or Editpad, depending on the computer.  Basically whatever's a normal-ish editor on that system.

[10:26:05.0000] <jwm>
my palm pre came with vi on it

[10:26:06.0000] <jwm>
:)

[10:27:00.0000] <chris_7>
if only I wanted to spend the time to learn elisp

[10:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
chris_7: If you're writing html in lisp, you should be using cl-who or similar anyway.  (Though, I don't know if that works in elisp, since it's a cl library...)

[10:28:00.0000] <chris_7>
TabAtkins, I'll look it up :)

[10:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Who said they were writing HTML in lisp?

[10:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sorry, I just assume that anyone using an editor with a lisp built-in and readily accessible wants to use lisp.  ^_^

[10:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also, I assume that everyone wants to use lisp.

[10:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Any project whose step one is implemening an HTML5 parser...

[10:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
So your proposal is (html (head (title Foo))) and so on, and then write functions to expand it to HTML?

[10:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yus.

[10:30:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, the cl-who version is (:html (:head (:title Foo)))

[10:30:03.0000] <chris_7>
Would that be more efficient in the end?

[10:30:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Arbitrary lisp expressions can be nested in there to construct your page, unlike plain HTML.

[10:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me doesn't know enough lisp to know what : signifies... atom?

[10:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Self-evaluating symbol.

[10:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Basically, guaranteed not-eq-to-anything-but-itself.

[10:31:03.0000] <chris_7>
Well... looks like I need a good lisp tutorial now haha

[10:31:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Awesome. Queensrÿche is on Spotify now.

[10:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
chris_7: Look up "practical common lisp".  Free webbook written by peter seibel, who's a good guy.

[10:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I know, taht's why I haven't tried

[10:32:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That'll teach you tons of practical lisp.

[10:32:03.0000] <chris_7>
TabAtkins, Awesome!

[10:32:04.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Also, it will not be awesome until Joanna Newsom is on spotify

TabAtkins, http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/

[10:32:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bwahaha, and I advance the lisp agenda one step further.

[10:32:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, that's it.

[10:33:00.0000] <chris_7>
lol one user at a time huh?

[10:33:01.0000] <jwm>
is there lisp for vim? :)

[10:33:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
We lispers have survived since 1960, we can afford to go slowly.

[10:33:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
jwm: Probably!

[10:33:04.0000] <jwm>
I love jquery fluid grid

[10:34:00.0000] <chris_7>
slow and steady wins the race I guess :P

[10:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
chris_7: Also, you should know TabAtkins is insane

[10:34:02.0000] <jwm>
http://www.zaum.co.uk/ - that design is awesome (resize window)

[10:34:03.0000] <jgraham>
And he has a certiticate to prove it!

[10:34:04.0000] <jwm>
mcse?

[10:34:05.0000] <Dashiva>
The advancement of lisp resembles the increase in wealth from a bank account with interest rate below inflation

[10:34:06.0000] <chris_7>
Ooooh ouch!

[10:35:00.0000] <chris_7>
Dashiva, Ice burn! haha

[10:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
jwm: Fluid grid doesn't seem to be useful outside of certain specific cases where you really don't care what order things are in.

[10:35:02.0000] <jwm>
you can order things too

[10:36:00.0000] <jwm>
I'm just saying it's a nice effect

[10:36:01.0000] <jwm>
my favorite web designs are full width ones

[10:36:02.0000] <jwm>
:)

[10:36:03.0000] <jwm>
I'm trying to come up with a web design I can use for multiple clients right now

[10:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I've done designs that would benefit from fluid grid, where I have a bunch of boxes that I just wanted to pack in tightly, but they're rare.

[10:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And a balanced multicol does the job equally, just distributed the opposite way.

[10:37:02.0000] <jwm>
well you'd be approaching the same concept with multicolumn

[10:38:00.0000] <jwm>
if you allowed more columns or less columns based on width

[10:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's what column-width is for.

[10:38:02.0000] <jwm>
yeah but column width looks ugly imo :)

[10:38:03.0000] <jwm>
you get huge boxes with wide content

[10:38:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
?_?

[10:38:05.0000] <jwm>
or skinny boxes with narrow content

[10:38:06.0000] <jwm>
you're saying keep the same number of columns

[10:38:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
You could replicate the demo exactly by using column-width:240px;

[10:39:00.0000] <jwm>
but grow the columns

[10:39:01.0000] <jwm>
ohh ok I see what you are saying

[10:39:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, I mean keep the same column-width, and change the number.  ^_^

[10:39:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
'columns' keeps the number steady, 'column-width' keeps the width steady.

[10:39:04.0000] <jwm>
well you'd be approach the same concept then :)

[10:39:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup.

[10:39:06.0000] <jwm>
I like the variable size content though

[10:39:07.0000] <jwm>
kind of breaks up the lines

[10:39:08.0000] <jwm>
you can do the same I know 

[10:39:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
That comes for free with multicol.  ^_^

[10:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And/or flexbox.

[10:40:01.0000] <jwm>
I like the animations though :)

[10:41:00.0000] <jwm>
I can't find that many animated html5 site designs out there

[10:41:01.0000] <jwm>
I found one cool site that links to 100s called cgvietnam.com

[10:41:02.0000] <jwm>
but other than that..

[10:42:00.0000] <chris_7>
TabAtkins, is this lisp book available in print?  I need to get a hard copy from my uni's library if they do.

[10:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, it is.

[10:51:00.0000] <chris_7>
Cheap school only keeps the online version and it's $60 at amazon.  Free on the internet it will stay

[10:56:00.0000] <theMadness>
Question, is http://www.css-zibaldone.com/test/generate/counters-pseudo-elements-000.html an opera bug, or is it a false expectation?

[10:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is what an opera bug?

[10:57:00.0000] <theMadness>
Should li have a counter if I tell them to be display:block ?

[10:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
theMadness: Opera bug

[10:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>
theMadness: the fact it's display:block has no effect

[10:57:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
theMadness: You're seeing *no* counters in Opera, correct?

[10:57:04.0000] <gsnedders>
s/has/should have/

[10:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: right

[10:58:01.0000] <theMadness>
TabAtkins, yep, none is present.

[10:58:02.0000] <theMadness>
Not that this case has any real world implication tbh.

[10:58:03.0000] <theMadness>
list-item and block are pretty similar to each other.

[10:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, that's a bug.  Making the <li>s display:block should suppress the *automatic* counter, but should have no effect on the one you manually inserted via ::before.

[10:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, list-item is a block with magic.

[10:59:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It just means "generate the ::marker pseudoelement for this box".

[10:59:03.0000] <jwm>
I don't like opera :/

[10:59:04.0000] <theMadness>
Yeah, that's relevant.

[11:00:00.0000] <jwm>
I know I know

[11:03:00.0000] <theMadness>
Anyone knows if Opera contacts you when they fix a bug you reported? Like an automated thing even.

[11:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've never been contacted, but then, maybe they just never fixed my bugs.

[11:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
theMadness: They don't

[11:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even Microsoft lets you see the bugs you filed.

[11:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even if it's just to hear "Won't fix for this release" one day after you file it.

[11:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
The only contact is when asking for more information, or when asking if you want to be acknowledged for a security bug they fixed, as far as I'm aware

[11:11:03.0000] <Philip`>
The easy solution is to get hired by Opera

[11:11:04.0000] <Philip`>
That's worked for most people in here

[11:22:00.0000] <chris_7>
TabAtkins, Do you know if Lisp in a Box comes with Emacs 23.1.1?

[11:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
chris_7: No clue - never used that distro.

[11:32:00.0000] <chris_V>
TabAtkins, don't think it does. I think it's pretty specific to the textbook

[12:15:00.0000] <chris_7>
TabAtkins, this book is quite spectacular and is exactly in the right direction I needed.  Thanks for the suggestion :)

[12:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You're welcome!

[12:45:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, flex draft reads nicely!

[12:46:00.0000] <annevk>
but uh, calc(20px + 1fl)? must be the most ugly CSS syntax ever

[12:48:00.0000] <annevk>
flex units somewhat make sense on their own, but adding them to normal lengths seems really odd

[12:50:00.0000] <Peter->
20px as the minimum width using the calc statement?

[12:51:00.0000] <annevk>
preferred width

[12:51:01.0000] <Peter->
These additional 20px change the available width, thus influencing the fl-value itself

[12:51:02.0000] <annevk>
meaning it can get smaller if there really is a need

[12:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Yeah, I know, but I don't think there's any way to express preferred lengths that isn't ugly or verbose.

[12:55:00.0000] <roc>
maybe Andrew's right and we should go without preferred widths until there's a clearer need

[12:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think the uses that you brought up, roc, are pretty clear.

[12:55:02.0000] <roc>
well

[12:56:00.0000] <roc>
he's right that you can kind of hack around most of them

[12:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, perhaps some of them can be done with just a min instead of preferred.

[12:56:02.0000] <annevk>
and some can be done using media queries

[12:56:03.0000] <annevk>
the draft lacks a definition of <flex> btw

[12:56:04.0000] <roc>
from my point of view, the main thing that sucks about not having preferred widths is that the existing Gecko and Webkit flexbox users won't map easily into the new world

[12:56:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Yeah, I know.  I've got some handwaveyness right now.

[12:57:00.0000] <roc>
but I don't want that to slow down flexbox for the Web

[12:57:01.0000] <annevk>
and is stuff like margin:0 auto 0 1fl; all clear?

[12:58:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders how much of chapter 9/10 of CSS is affected

[12:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Yes.  See 7.1.1

[12:58:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or, I guess, 7.1.1.3

[12:58:03.0000] <roc>
dbaron: ^^^

[12:58:04.0000] <annevk>
7.1.1 doesn't seem to take into account elements with intrinsic widths for instance

[12:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Elaborate?

[12:59:01.0000] <annevk>
7.1.1.1

[12:59:02.0000] <annevk>
well, the 'width' can be auto, but you wouldn't want it to be treated as 1fl

[12:59:03.0000] <annevk>
methinks

[12:59:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
width:auto is treated as 1fl only if it's the only flexible length in that direction for that element.  Otherwise it's treated as fit-content.

[13:00:00.0000] <annevk>
and height would also become 1fl without taking into account the aspect ratio?

[13:01:00.0000] <annevk>
we have so many special cases currently for all these scenarios should all that be thrown away? guess it would make things easier...

[13:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Current flexbox draft, when translated into my new draft, essentially makes 'auto' equal to "fit-content" along the box-pack axis, and "1fl" along the box-align axis.

[13:01:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, it doesn't care about aspect ratio.

[13:01:03.0000] <annevk>
i'm not sure how much i like that

[13:02:00.0000] <annevk>
also, is 'fit-content' defined?

[13:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I assume it's somewhere.  dbaron's mentioned it before.

[13:03:00.0000] <annevk>
in http://dbaron.org/css/intrinsic/ ...

[13:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's a new name for 'intrinsic', yeah.

[13:03:02.0000] <annevk>
also not defined ;)

[13:03:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
"shrinkwrap", then.  ^_^

[13:04:00.0000] <annevk>
jaja

[13:06:00.0000] <roc>
'intrinsic' isnt' defined, but it is used so we may as well keep using it :-)

[13:08:00.0000] <annevk>
i'm not opposed to having it

[13:08:01.0000] <annevk>
i'm mildly opposed to Opera having to reverse engineer what it means

[13:08:02.0000] <annevk>
but I think we might have already

[13:08:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's "whatever you do to floats".

[13:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also, tables.

[13:09:01.0000] <roc>
right

[13:09:02.0000] <annevk>
sure yeah, all things that are not really defined

[13:09:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I use display:table-cell sometimes as a temporary hack for width:fit-content.)

[13:09:04.0000] <roc>
CSS needs to define that

[13:10:00.0000] <roc>
just use width:-moz-fit-content :-)

[13:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd like it to work in IE8 too.  ^_^

[13:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is using -moz-fit-content on a page of his, though, where it doesn't matter that the thing defaults to width:auto everywhere else.

[13:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: It's just max(min-content, min(max-content,available width)).

[13:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Where "min-content" is "the width if you take every linebreak opportunity possible" and max-content is "the width if you don't take any non-forced linebreaks".

[13:15:00.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, it's a) not that simple and b) not defined by CSS in detail so far

[13:15:01.0000] <annevk>
but I have to go now; ttyl

[13:15:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Sure.  But it needs to be, so I'll just depend on it and assume that it will be defined.

[13:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
theMadness: Yeah, really getting hired is the only way

[13:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: Or volunteer ;)

[13:22:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
so how long will it take until someone implements this with html5 http://vimeo.com/9194146

[13:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Damn you, Linux flash player!

[13:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Oh yeah good point, you could volunteer. No idea how one does that though

[13:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.  Loading of my ad script blocks loading of my page.  Is there any way to avoid that cross-browser?  Like could I just put it in an iframe, or would that have bad consequences?

[13:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ideally, could I stop the script from freezing my page?  It seems to be freezing my page right now for some reason.

[13:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some kind of malfunction.

[13:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, it already is an iframe . . . blast.

[13:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some script from quantserve.com is hanging the page.  Drat it.

[13:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hopefully only for me.

[14:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Obvious solution: Delete the ad script blocks

[14:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Amazing idea.  Too bad it will cost the site owner the several thousand dollars a year that I need to pay for bandwidth and hardware.

[14:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(he needs, rather)

[14:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Swap to an ad provider with less broken scripts

[14:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, except that a) this one makes me twice as much money as AdSense, b) it prohibits concurrent use of other gaming-related ad providers, so I can't experiment much.

[14:15:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, they've mostly worked okay.

[14:15:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I would have thought that scripts in an iframe wouldn't interfere with stuff outside the iframe, but I guess I was wrong.

[14:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: This doesn't sound like "mostly working OK"

[14:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
To be fair to them, it might have been a problem with Chrome dev channel.  We've had them for a year, this was the only time I've seen it, and it didn't show up in Firefox or when I restarted Chrome.

[14:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So really it would be nice more because I'd like loading not to block for the extra few hundred ms.

[14:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or rendering, I guess I mean.

[14:16:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me types how many ms it is

[14:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
The idea of letting some random third part write more or less anything they like into my page is mildly terrifying

[14:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
Aren't there any ad companies who compete on not doing that

[14:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: You mean like blog comments?

[14:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: No, I mean unlike blog comments, which tend to be heavily sanitised first

[14:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, I guess your "anything" includes arbitrary HTML

[14:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
$9,000 a year is enough to offset any terror I may have at that thought.

[14:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(particularly since hosting costs more than $6,000 and there are no other meaningful revenue sources for the site)

[14:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
It seems much more profitable for ad companies to compete on how simple it is to embed their ads into your page, and how they can update their implementation without having to tell you to update your embedding code, which in practice means they'll just make you use an <iframe> or a <script>, I guess

[14:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Except that they don't necessarily compete so much.  In fact, the one I use has explicit anti-competitive wording in its EULA, prohibiting you from trying out competitors, and this seems to be typical.

[14:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although your conclusion holds, yes.

[14:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They want to be able to update without changing the deployed HTML.

[14:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Plus they want to collect data that's only available to script, for better targeting and maybe for resale.

[14:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(good thing my site has no meaningful privacy policy)

[14:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
Surely there must be somewhere that clauses like "you are forbidden from trying our competitors" are illegal

[14:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Doubtful.

[14:25:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It might be only if it's on the same page, though.

[14:25:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Let me check.

[14:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nope: "Use of other gaming networks to sell advertising space on a web site which has its advertising space being sold by GAO is subject to Our mutual agreement."

[14:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they'd have a hard time successfully suing you for trying a competitor, but they can just cancel your account and keep all your money

[14:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
GamerDNA has a similar requirement, except vastly more horrible.

[14:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, and I don't want to break my agreements anyway.

[14:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it doesn't need to be a legally viable thing

[14:27:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: There are practical issues

[14:27:03.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not suggesting you should break it

[14:27:04.0000] <jgraham>
I'm wondering if its legal

[14:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Quick! Find a lawyer!

[14:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
Nah, better to wildly speculate

[14:28:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm pretty sure it's legal.

[14:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Exclusivity is pretty common in all sorts of contracts, no?

[14:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
(it would be pretty surprising if, say, Apple buried somewhere in the iTunes license agreement that you were prohibited from using other media players)

[14:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
I guess

[14:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I imagine that's a different story, since you don't have large sums of money changing hands there.

[14:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
AutoCAD then

[14:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_of_adhesion#Contracts_of_adhesion

[14:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems to me that there's a difference between saying "you can't serve someone else's software from your site" and "you can't have other software installed separately on your desktop".

[14:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although I can't put my finger on it.

[14:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, they're jerks, yes.  I wish I could shop around some more.

[14:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, what I wish is that AdSense gave me non-pathetic amounts of income.  It was running things like Muslim dating sites, on my gaming forum, because someone mentioned Islam somewhere in their signature.  Srsly.

[14:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or better yet, it ran Muslim dating ads in topics in our politics forum about how the Muslims are all devil-worshiping terrorists who should be nuked.  Kind of the wrong audience.

[14:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe it was playing devils-advocate?

[14:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Running on the "those who complain most loudly..." theory?

[15:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, Tab is still using 2048-bit hashes to index his content.

[15:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me boggles at URL

[15:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wanna fight about it?

[15:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
[18:42] <jgraham> chris_7: Also, you should know TabAtkins is insane

[15:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
Clearly this is not widely enough known

[15:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Look, I provide a shorturl for you people.  Why aren't you happy with that?

[15:32:01.0000] <chris_7>
jgraham, there is method to TabAtkins insanity

[15:32:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just don't look at the url bar after following the shorturl.

[15:34:00.0000] <chris_7>
jgraham, You might also want to look at the end of this channels /topic haha

[15:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, I just read on Slashdot about some security researcher trying to jump on the clickjacking bandwagon by making up a cool name for his hypothetical attack.  It was "tabnapping", which immediately reminded me of "catnap" rather than "kidnap", so I pictured you taking a nap.

[15:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rather than one of my browser's tabs being abducted, as intended.

[15:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(although I use "picture" loosely, since I have no idea what you look like)

[15:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I do, in fact, kidnap people.  I'm unshaven and dressed in a cat-burglar outfit.

[15:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Do cat-burglars normally kidnap people?

[15:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm bucking the trend.

[15:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That way no one suspects me.

[15:50:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ingenius.

[15:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
They're all "Oh, that dude's just knocking over a house.", while really I'm all shoving people in my trunk.

[15:51:01.0000] <svl>
AryehGregor: not a "Security researcher" - Aza, Firefox's "Creative Lead" - http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/a-new-type-of-phishing-attack/

[15:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, okay.

[15:51:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I didn't actually read the story, looked boring and overhyped.  Like most stories about hypothetical threats, especially social-engineering-type attacks like this.

[15:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, I read in the Slashdot summary something like "Most users know by now not to click links in suspicious e-mails", and whoever wrote that instantly lost all credibility in my eyes.

[15:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
The problem is clicking links in non-suspicious emails

[15:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's no good if you're only protecting yourself against incompetent attackers who can't make a plausible-looking email

[15:53:01.0000] <svl>
I don't think this was ever intended to be this widely hyped and re-reported. Just part of the thinking process about the new Firefox account manager, and what sort of potential situations it'd need to deal with

[15:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was going to say, the Firefox Account Manager is the right way to go here, to fight phishing.

[15:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This doesn't seem like it needs different types of countermeasures to usual phishing, does it?

[15:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Seems not.

[15:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It is a pretty slick demonstration, though.

[16:10:00.0000] <chris_7>
TabAtkins, Do you know of a Lisp specific irc channel I can join?  I'm probably going to be needing it soon.

[16:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I do not, unfortunately.

[16:10:02.0000] <chris_7>
Unfortunate

[16:10:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though there is #lisp on freenode.

[16:10:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which has a lot of people in it

[16:11:00.0000] <chris_7>
Thanks :)  I'd rather use there to ask questions about it.  Want to stay on channel topic

[16:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
very cool to see that Mozilla is now getting a built-in DOM inspector

[16:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
already now in Minefield

[16:41:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://antennasoft.net/robcee/2010/05/14/inspector-landing/

[16:41:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, really?

[16:41:04.0000] <Rik`>
MikeSmith: I don't understand why it has to be a new tool

[16:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://antennasoft.net/robcee/2010/05/21/inspector-impetus/

[16:42:01.0000] <Rik`>
I've already read that and it's not explaining anything

[16:42:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Rik`: you mean as opposed to building with Firebug or the existing DOM Inspector extension?

[16:42:03.0000] <Rik`>
yep

[16:43:00.0000] <Rik`>
it's not introducing a new UI from the screenshots I've seen 

[16:43:01.0000] <boblet>
wow, you’re up early Mike. meetings?

[16:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there seem to be some good clarifications in the comments of http://antennasoft.net/robcee/2010/05/21/inspector-impetus/

[16:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
comment from Colby Russell

[16:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and from Rob too

[16:45:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., " It’d be technically difficult to include Firebug in its entirety in Firefox, requiring a significant rewrite to get the code in line with the browser’s."

[16:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and from Colby: Firebug guys have their own approach and way of development, outside of Mozilla’s infrastructure" but .." there’s nothing saying future convergence is out of the question. "

[16:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I was glad to see this too.

[16:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: yeah

[16:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It will be quite a while till it gets up to speed with WebKit's Web Inspector, I'd guess, let alone Firebug (which is reportedly better than WebKit's Web Inspector but I never noticed).

[16:47:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
AryehGregor: true that

[16:47:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
(although I did notice when I used Firebug in Firefox and Gmail warned me that I should disable it or else it would slow down the site)

[16:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I think they eventually fixed that)

[16:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
wow, yeah I hope so

[16:48:02.0000] <Rik`>
MikeSmith: I don't get the point of including a less powerful and stable tool inside Firefox

[16:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, they fixed that a long time ago.

[16:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That was before they required you to enable the Net tab on a site-by-site basis.

[16:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
AryehGregor: anyway, it seems like Rob has carved out some time to work on it in earnest so I'd expect to see it improve pretty quickly

[16:49:03.0000] <Rik`>
I mean every web developer that needs a tool knows Firebug

[16:49:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik`, because it will be *more* stable in the long run, and will be available when you're debugging some random dude's computer.

[16:49:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I find Firebug to be *much* better than Webkit's inspector, but that may be partially just usability.

[16:49:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
Rik`: what AryehGregor said

[16:49:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
It will actually be available consistently.

[16:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like, you know, you don't have to wait for Firebug to be released for the new Firefox version, and upgrade it separately.

[16:50:01.0000] <Rik`>
that's a separate problem

[16:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Though, a recent change where hovering an element in firebug makes a box pop up with inherent dimensions is actually *really freaking annoying*.)

[16:50:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
No it's not, it's inherent to the separate development as an extension.

[16:50:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or maybe to Firefox's unstable extension interface that breaks on every release.

[16:50:05.0000] <Rik`>
3.6 came with a stable version of Firebug

[16:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, that's after I stopped using Firefox as my main browser, so I can't say.

[16:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, what features does Firebug have that you miss in WebKit's Web Inspector?

[16:51:02.0000] <boblet>
Rik`: not having it as part of Firefox is starting to seem strange, as all the other browsers have (or apparently will have) dev tools bundled

[16:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: I don't think you can add CSS rules directly to particular declaration blocks in webkit's inspector.

[16:52:01.0000] <boblet>
(fingers crossed that the IE team feels embarrassed enough to make something half way usable for IE9)

[16:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, I'm pretty sure you can.

[16:52:03.0000] <Rik`>
boblet: they have a dev tool in IE8 already

[16:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Could you tell me how?  ^_^  I'm clicking around in the logical areas and nothing useful is happening.

[16:53:01.0000] <Rik`>
but you don't have to make a new tool to get Firebug installed with Firefox

[16:53:02.0000] <boblet>
Rik`: not quite Dragonfly/Inspector level yet tho

[16:53:03.0000] <Rik`>
TabAtkins: double clicking

[16:53:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
That lets me edit a particular rule in a block, but not to add new rules.

[16:54:00.0000] <Rik`>
TabAtkins: tabbing to the last rule

[16:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rik`: Ah, got it.

[16:55:00.0000] <Rik`>
you also have a "New style rule" option in the gear menu

[16:55:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, I guess that's about everything then.  The rest of the things I use is here now (last time I seriously tried to use webkit's inspector it was much simpler).

[16:56:00.0000] <Rik`>
there has been a lot of work from Google guys

[16:57:00.0000] <Rik`>
anyway, creating a new tool from nothing just to make it a default seems like dividing the amount of work by two on each tool

deadline June 7

[16:58:02.0000] <Rik`>
TabAtkins: do you know if there has been a lot of requests for nested rules in CSS ?

[16:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Rik`: Well, it's a feature of every CSS preprocessor I know of.

[17:00:00.0000] <Rik`>
the only reference I could find on www-style is http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009May/0028.html

[17:01:00.0000] <Rik`>
that's my point exactly : seeing it in a lot of preprocessors means there is a real need

[17:22:00.0000] <dbaron>
annevk, TabAtkins, I did start writing up definitions of how intrinsic sizing works in http://dbaron.org/css/intrinsic/ , but I didn't get all that far

[17:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yay dbaron!  Now just get further and we'll publish that bad boy.

[17:23:00.0000] <roc>
There are various issues with Firebug

[17:23:01.0000] <roc>
since it doesn't live in mozilla-central, it's hard to have automated tests that test it all the time

[17:24:00.0000] <roc>
because it needs to run with older versions of Firefox, the Firebug devs have a tendency to hack around platform bugs/limitations rather than just fix them

[17:25:00.0000] <dbaron>
I think the solution is dropping the "need" to run with older versions and evolve the two together, but anyway...

aboodman: about Grant Simpon's comment on the "Installable web apps" thread, maybe something like "dockable web apps" would be a better term

[19:50:00.0000] <karlcow>
MikeSmith: booglable web apps?

[20:03:00.0000] <wirepair>
persistent web apps? ;>

[20:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think "persistent" has the same risk of confusion as "installable"

[20:05:00.0000] <wirepair>
true ;/

[20:05:01.0000] <wirepair>
that's a tricky one

[20:06:00.0000] <karlcow>
:)

[20:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I do like "booglable" though

close enough to "buggerable"

[20:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe too close for comfort

[20:11:00.0000] <boblet>
i was thinking it was French for booger-able

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010May/0504.html -- makes sense to me. Anyone here thinks the callback should not become a simple boolean?

[04:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
Did I do something obvious wrong?

[04:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: no, you didn't. that's the #1 V.nu local use FAQ

[04:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: have you tried rerunning python build/build.py localent?

[04:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: There is an FAQ? I should have checked, really...

[04:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: running that didn't make any difference

[04:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
(where is the FAQ?)

[04:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh it works now

[04:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
No idea if I changed anything

[05:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: nothing changed -- the problem is that the build always fails with that message the first time you run it

[05:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
from a fresh checkout

[05:00:02.0000] <jgraham>
Ummm....

[05:00:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
running the build a second time fixes it

[05:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that rebuilds the necessary localent stuff

[05:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's definitely something that should be changed in the build file

[05:01:02.0000] <jgraham>
Ah, OK

[05:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith, hsivonen: thanks for the help

[05:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess we could work around it for now by tweaking the build file to cause the build to be run twice the first time you check out

[05:04:00.0000] <sid__>
hi i wanted to ask about webstorage in HTML5.. When we use the anonymous functions in the callback like executeSql i think I  am facing there are some scope related problems while setting variables ...  does any one know how to safely set the scope of local variables from inside of anonymous functions?

[05:04:01.0000] <sid__>
am new to js...

[05:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
sid__: Possibly you just need to use "var foo = bar" rather than "foo = bar". Otherwise I don't understand the question

[05:06:01.0000] <annevk>
using the var statement should help

[05:06:02.0000] <jgraham>
Javascript is so awesome. How could making variables lobal by default possibly go wrong?

[05:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
*global

[05:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds function-scoping much more annoying than default-global

[05:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: At least ECMAScript doesn't ahve that behaviour inherently

[05:07:03.0000] <jgraham>
As opposed to block scoping?

[05:07:04.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[05:07:05.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Huh?

[05:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Most (all?) ES shells will throw ReferenceError if you do (function(){foo=1;})();

[05:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
(since I want to do "for (var i = 0; i < 4; ++i) setTimeout(function() { alert(i) }, 100)" etc, instead of having to write it more like "for (var i = 0; i < 4; ++i) (function(i){setTimeout(function() { alert(i) }, 100)})(i)")

[05:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: No they won't

[05:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders what he's misremebering

[05:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: They way that variablke scoping works in ECMAScript?

[05:11:00.0000] <sid__>
http://pastebin.com/n8Yk4fQ6

[05:11:01.0000] <sid__>
hi here is an example

[05:11:02.0000] <sid__>
the variable var1

[05:11:03.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: That is a pretty special case

[05:11:04.0000] <sid__>
is not getting set...

[05:11:05.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: (although I don't disagree)

[05:13:00.0000] <sid__>
jgraham: one simple way would be to make a class for call backs and set the variables to fetch from there... but is there a simpler way?

[05:13:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I encountered it several times before understanding what the problem really was

[05:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
mostly when doing stuff like dynamically creating lots of scripted buttons

[05:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Ah, I have never done that

[05:15:00.0000] <sid__>
Is this all about understanding of closures?

[05:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
sid__: I assume your problem is that the callback is async so it hasn't been run when the function returns

[05:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
(the closure stuff looks fine)

[05:17:00.0000] <sid__>
jgraham: So how to solve this?

[05:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
sid__: I don't know what you are actually trying to achieve

[05:17:02.0000] <jgraham>
But you don't want to block on an SQL query running

[05:18:00.0000] <sid__>
well i am trying to return a result set to a calling function...

[05:18:01.0000] <sid__>
do i use the synchronus stuff mentioned in the w3c standard?

[05:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
The database API is asynchronous, so you can't return a result from it synchronously

[05:19:01.0000] <sid__>
Philip`: there is a section 4.4 that says someting about syncro stuff http://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase

[05:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[05:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't actually know anything about the database API

[05:20:02.0000] <sid__>
oh!

[05:21:00.0000] <sid__>
so the only way to process is supplying a call back function?

[05:21:01.0000] <sid__>
as in when the query completes...

[05:21:02.0000] <sid__>
?

[05:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like the synchronous API is only available in workers, not in normal web page scripts

[05:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
so you have to use the async one

[05:22:02.0000] <sid__>
hmm

[05:22:03.0000] <sid__>
no but 

[05:22:04.0000] <sid__>
i think

[05:22:05.0000] <Philip`>
which means using a callback function instead of a return value

[05:23:00.0000] <sid__>
Thnks!

[05:23:01.0000] <sid__>
was about to split my head over that!

[05:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
(It's a bit of a pain that you have to rearchitect large parts of the application when adding a single asynchronous operation into the middle of it)

[05:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: It's not really clear how to avoid that pain though

[05:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
You can avoid it by starting with an asynchronous design

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: there's no written FAQ. your question is just the most frequent question I get

[05:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
(or using a programming environment that makes everything asynchronous automatically)

[05:26:01.0000] <sid__>
Philip`: perhaps some neat design pattern

[05:26:02.0000] <sid__>
probably event based tuff

[05:26:03.0000] <sid__>
stuff*

[05:26:04.0000] <sid__>
Philip`: and yes i will have to rewrite my app again :(

[05:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Having a programming environement that makes everything async probably trades simplicity in simple cases for simplicity in complex cases 

[05:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
Although it is also likely appropriate for the web

[05:31:00.0000] <annevk>
sid__, you could use a worker

[05:34:00.0000] <sid__>
annevk: let me see... 

[05:38:00.0000] <sid__>
annevk: so the use the synchronus elements instead of the asynchronus ones...Is the solution just that simple...?

[05:39:00.0000] <sid__>
BTW the only difference in the API is that the call back and the error functions are not there...

[05:39:01.0000] <sid__>
i mean the diff between API of the async and synchro stuff...

[05:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
sid__: Workers can't e.g. access the DOM, so you'd have to tell a worker to do the database operations and then (asynchronously) get the results back and display them

[05:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it wouldn't necessarily be much simpler

[05:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
Workers seem more complex 

[05:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
In general

[05:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
Does Mobile Safari even support workers?

[05:41:03.0000] <annevk>
sid__, the database interaction would be synchronous, but the UI interaction would be asynchronous

[05:41:04.0000] <jgraham>
(I assume that's what you are targetting, although I would be happy to be wrong)

[05:42:00.0000] <sid__>
well i am making a scrapbook plugin for Chrome...:)

[05:42:01.0000] <sid__>
And saving the data in the provided webstorage

[05:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
Ah OK

[05:42:03.0000] <jgraham>
Well workers are a possibility then

[05:42:04.0000] <sid__>
the operations are to simply store and retrieve data elements 

[05:42:05.0000] <jgraham>
although I doubt they help much in this case

[05:44:00.0000] <sid__>
jgraham: I assume that i can simply return the result set *after the call completes* with workers to solve my problems...

[05:44:01.0000] <sid__>
Let me try\

[05:44:02.0000] <sid__>
Thanks

[05:44:03.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, nice email

[05:45:00.0000] <annevk>
I hadn't read the specific approach Google was proposing yet. I agree that the centralized solution they propose is wrong.

[05:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: thanks. do you know / can you say if Opera has reconsidered the widget stuff in light of the HTML5 app cache?

[05:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, if Opera were starting without a widget legacy, would there still be good reasons to do widgets instead of pinning stuff to HTML5 app cache?

[05:55:00.0000] <annevk>
opinions vary :)

[05:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I see 

[05:59:00.0000] <annevk>
you can see some of them on http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2010AprJun/ "[widgets] Zip vs GZip Tar"

[06:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
Widgets make some sense for a limited set of use cases. There are still some things that widgets can do that web apps and app cache currently can't do well

[06:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
sid__: Why do you need workers to do that?

[08:30:00.0000] <annevk>
oh hey, tantek works for Mozilla now, cool

[08:31:00.0000] <Peter`>
Just read Chris Wilson's tweet about it

[08:34:00.0000] <annevk>
same here :)

[08:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me saw arun's

[08:46:00.0000] <annevk>
http://arunranga.com/blog/2010/05/tantek-celik-working-with-mozilla/ lets hope he does figure out those form controls

[08:46:01.0000] <annevk>
though last time I talked about it with tantek he described it as a solved problem; hopefully that changed :)

[08:46:02.0000] <Peter`>
A really small comment about http://www.w3.org/html/wg/ : the footer's background colour (blue) is exactly the same as the anchor-colour (Sam Ruby and Michael(tm) Smith), making these unreadable without selecting them

[08:48:00.0000] <Peter`>
I probably have to e-mail that to someone (though it's rather non-important)

[08:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
Peter`: Dunno who has access to that; maybe MikeSmith or othermaciej 

[08:55:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah bug mike

[08:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: I see yo have discovered the 60s :)

[08:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
Actually 50s

[08:58:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, making my way back in time, ever so slowly

[08:59:00.0000] <annevk>
I really like that quote, still have to finish part of the book though

[09:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: I have never quite got into Kerouac; I mean I read On The Road and then tried Big Sur but sort of got fed up with the wall of text thing

[09:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, tantek wants to work on flexbox too.  Interesting.

[09:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd better get some time with him, then.

[09:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Note to self: when Mozilla blog says "(can freeze your browser)", it means it.

[09:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It froze half my tabs in Chrome.

[09:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm impressed.

[10:05:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
yay benchmark: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/05/better-performance-with-lazy-frame-construction/ opera 10.54: 2740ms/113ms, minefield: 1966ms/194ms, chrome dev: 80631ms/86ms

[10:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, so you're saying it wasn't actually frozen, just spending 80 s doing the computation?

[10:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well.

[10:14:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
seems so

[10:17:00.0000] <annevk>
whoa, we should fix layout

[10:17:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: we're not horribly slow like chrome

[10:17:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
but clearly it can be optimized

[10:19:00.0000] <annevk>
oh wait, got the first number wrong

[10:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chrome is amazingly terrible.  How real-world is this benchmark, I wonder?

[10:21:00.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, waiting for the day that layout is 10x faster

[10:21:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: yeah, annoying javascript gets all the benchmark attention

[10:23:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
s/benchmark/optimization/

[10:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan_: Easy to measure?

[10:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
I mean as a reason that js gets all the attention

[10:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although it is really important for e.g. canvas games

[11:30:00.0000] <annevk>
bit of shame we called it "CACHE MANIFEST"

[11:31:00.0000] <annevk>
would be kind of natural to use that file for application data

[11:32:00.0000] <annevk>
though I guess we could just ignore the name and all

[11:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
WebKit can actually do lazy construction of render objects so I wonder why that benchmark is slow

[11:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
othermaciej: Because it's not actually doing it?

[11:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gsnedders: my guess would be that something else is pathologically slow but I could be wrong

[11:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think there is acttually an element with id="lastchild" in the document

[11:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I bet what happens is our getElementById is slow when no element with that id is present, or something like that

[11:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so container.insertBefore(div, lastchild) ends up being just a funny way to say container.append(div)

[11:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe it's the if (/AppleWebKit/.test(navigator.userAgent)) { for (i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++); } part that does it.

[11:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
:-p

[12:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That was exciting.

[12:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is why I use Linux!

[12:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
First my mouse cursor disappeared.

[12:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems like it might be a video driver issue, according to posts I read on the forums, and no one had any fixes, but rebooting was a workaround.

[12:29:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
So then I tried restarting X.

[12:29:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
This just shut my monitors off.

[12:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then I tried rebooting.

[12:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
To an old kernel.

[12:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it seems my 10.04 userspace doesn't like the 9.10 kernel, because it gave me this cool effect of only using the top half of one of my monitors, with the bottom half being noise, and attempts to change the resolution resulting in even crazier effects.

[12:30:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I rebooted again.

[12:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And now it works, for now.

[12:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
<3 Ubuntu.

[12:55:00.0000] <appden>
hello

[12:56:00.0000] <appden>
the svn url on http://syntax.whattf.org/ is dead wrong

[12:56:01.0000] <appden>
I somehow found it and mirrored the repo to github, if anyone prefers seeing it there

[12:56:02.0000] <appden>
http://github.com/appden/html5-syntax

[12:56:03.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, ^^

[13:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
"""A "fika" is a Swedish word for an ambiguous meeting that may or may not be a date""" huh

[13:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
Either I misunderstood or we have office dates once a week

[13:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
(actually that definition is wrong, but I don't want to disappoint the people who think that the only topic in this channel is Swedish translation)

[13:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Also, your missing context.

[13:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(That quote is from <http://kommissariecuriosa.blogspot.com/2005/11/swedish-mating-and-dating.html>)

[13:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
s/your/you're/

[13:21:00.0000] <annevk>
lol

[13:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(That post is absolutely brilliant. Do read it.)

[13:21:02.0000] <annevk>
just did

[13:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Yeah, the blog does go on to say that the definition is wrong

[13:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's proof the plan of some to get me engaged before I leave Opera is doomed to fail. There's simply not enough time.

[13:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Read in the comments. It doesn't have to be like that

[13:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Also I know some pretty hardcore Christians so if you got them drunk enough to get them knocked up then you might get a shotgun wedding

[13:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me didn't read many comments earlier, as he was trying to work...

[13:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although I don't really endorse that as a plan

[13:24:01.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders, this is an absurdist play, right ?

[13:24:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Well, it's closer to what I described as the normal Scottish dating pattern earlier

[13:24:03.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: Absurdity? That's Sweden.

[13:25:00.0000] <erlehmann>
and thus i propose: NO MORE SWEDEN

[13:25:01.0000] <erlehmann>
to make the world mundane again !

[13:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: That is, get stupendiously drunk, sleep together, then the man calls the girl out for a date, and that's about it.

[13:25:03.0000] <annevk>
the world needs Sweden

[13:26:00.0000] <annevk>
keeps the IETF at bay :p

[13:27:00.0000] <erlehmann>
also, "dates" are weird. i once went out with an american gal and she had difficulties to comprehend the "split the bill" part. also, she smoked. but on the plus side, she moved whenever the wind was blowing the smoke in my direction, huh ?

[13:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
"Come here I think you're beautiful/I think you're beautiful, beautiful/Some kind of stranger come inside"

[13:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I had to give up on a girl when I learned she was a smoker.  :/

[13:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
erlehmann: Americans are weird.

[13:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I still maintain that Orthodox Jews have it best.  Someone sets you up, and both parties are very clear that they're only looking for marriage.  Thus two people will rarely have to date for more than a few weeks.  None of this angst about what the exact status is.

[13:28:02.0000] <erlehmann>
annevk, charles stross should write a science fiction story where the WHATWG takes over government business after a major disaster, due to some laws refering (!) to HTML standards :P

[13:28:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
But yeah, american dates are either (1) paid for by the guy, if he asked the girl out, or (2) *maybe* split, if the girl asked the guy out.

[13:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I laugh at all the people who spend their teenage years agonizing over their girlfriend/boyfriend.

[13:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Something like a movie is easier to split, but food usually isn't.

[13:29:02.0000] <erlehmann>
TabAtkins, i once kissed a friend just right after she was having a cigarette, just to see how it is. awful, as expected — but the smell went away after we both drank more wine ;)

[13:29:03.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: That sounds like many other systems

[13:29:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also Christmas.  It sounds like it would be horrible to have to think of presents to give to everyone you know.

[13:29:05.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Well, I was apparently meant to go to aerobics this evening to meet some girl. I said no. :P

[13:29:06.0000] <erlehmann>
AryehGregor, I laugh at all people. period.

[13:29:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: That's why they invented gift cards

[13:29:08.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I hardly give presents to anyone

[13:29:09.0000] <AryehGregor>
erlehmann, excellent policy.

[13:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
I don't think I am particularly mean

[13:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me probably also would hardly give presents to everyone, but doesn't even have to worry about that.

[13:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me certainly didn't give jgraham for Christmas

[13:30:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*anything for Christmas

[13:30:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: I only give gifts to my wife, brothers, parents, and then one extra person in the family, chosen at thanksgiving (we all draw names from a hat)

[13:30:05.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I'm really not yours to give away

[13:30:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, celebrating a totally different set of holidays from everyone else around you is a real pain.  Part of why I'm thinking of moving to Israel.

[13:30:07.0000] <erlehmann>
TabAtkins, food is easy to split. here in berlin, you get asked that when you pay and you remotely look like you belong to each other and get separate bills if you want.

[13:31:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
erlehmann: Does the new Ministry of Standards decide that all laws should be compatible with how people already behave?

[13:31:01.0000] <erlehmann>
AryehGregor, I also do not often give presents. Way to go.

[13:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, you usually have to be *very* explicit about bill-splitting in america.  Pretty annoying.

[13:31:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, food is easy to split.  I've done it lots of times when going to a restaurant with random friends.

[13:31:04.0000] <jgraham>
Split bills are rather common here

[13:31:05.0000] <jgraham>
Much more so than in the UK

[13:31:06.0000] <jgraham>
Typically everyone goes up to the counter and pays

[13:31:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Going out with friends, sure, you just ask for a split bill when you order.  Going out on a date?  That's harder.

[13:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although you have to remember what you ordered

[13:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
You don't even need to look together in the UK to get a single bill.

[13:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
mbrubeck, it would be awesome if laws reflected reality, instead of most of them being totally unenforced.

[13:32:03.0000] <jgraham>
Which is hard when you couldn't pronounce it the first time

[13:32:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, oh, so you mean socially and not technically.

[13:32:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Yes.

[13:32:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Though maybe going out as two people with a girl of similar age doesn't help getting split bills.

[13:32:07.0000] <gsnedders>
So maybe my sample is a bit out.

[13:32:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, just order the same thing every time, and only go to three different restaurants.  Simple.

[13:32:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: Ministan.  Goes great with the other ministries.

[13:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Borning. And probably expensive

[13:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: What restauarants are cheap here?

[13:33:02.0000] <gsnedders>
*restaurants

[13:33:03.0000] <jgraham>
(because if you could only have three dishes it would have to be the nice ones)

[13:33:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I only go to one restaurant per date.  Personal policy.

[13:33:05.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Umm...

[13:33:06.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Lame

[13:33:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, are you assuming that I have any culinary sensibilities whatsoever?

[13:33:08.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: My point exactly. It's going to be expensive anywhere, whatever you get.

[13:33:09.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, surely you mean "went", since you've been married for several years.

[13:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: You should make a point of going somewhere different for dessert and or coffee / etc.

[13:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I go on dates with my wife!

[13:34:02.0000] <mbrubeck>
"War is peace. Freedom is slavery. text/html is XHTML."

[13:34:03.0000] <erlehmann>
mbrubeck, not exactly. king-president hickson will refuse to enact laws when apple town and mozillaville disagree on what standard holo TVs should be based on.

[13:34:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Those usually aren't called dates, they're called "nights out" or something.

[13:34:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Nah, I'd rather just go to some place with good desserts to start with.

[13:34:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: I call them dates.

[13:34:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me just gets pizza if he's at a pizza place, and General Tso's chicken at a Chinese place, and asks whoever he's with what to get if he's anywhere else

[13:34:08.0000] <jgraham>
mbrubeck: Surely you mean "ar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Going out with your wife is a date"

[13:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me also never goes to restaurants.

[13:35:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me is incapable of making a decision

[13:35:02.0000] <erlehmann>
TabAtkins, ministan sounds like a minor soviet ex-republic :D

[13:35:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: But *what kind* of pizza?

[13:35:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Normal's fine.

[13:35:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe extra cheese.

[13:35:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
What if they don't have normal?

[13:35:07.0000] <gsnedders>
(it doesn't matter what type of decision, I'm just incapable of making decisions.)

[13:35:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
What pizza place doesn't have normal pizza?

[13:35:09.0000] <gsnedders>
(I might get mocked by some for this.)

[13:35:10.0000] <gsnedders>
/me glares at jgraham 

[13:35:11.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't think BJ's has a plain pepperoni.

[13:35:12.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suppose you can order a cheese, but you have to ask for it.

[13:35:13.0000] <AryehGregor>
I said plain, not pepperoni.

[13:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What is "plain"?

[13:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like, just tomato sauce and cheese.

[13:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
And, you know, some crust.

[13:36:03.0000] <erlehmann>
A cheese BJ !

[13:36:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Pepperoni pizza isn't kosher, it mixes milk with meat.

[13:36:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, right.

[13:36:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, I subsist on two specific types of cereal that I buy in enormous quantities, plus sometimes one particular brand of frozen pizza, plus sometimes one particular brand of packaged macaroni and cheese, plus ~2L of caffeine-free Diet Pepsi per day, plus whatever my mother makes.

[13:36:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is enough variety for me.

[13:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Are the two cereals Count Chocula and Cap'n Crunch?

[13:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because if not, your choices are wrong.

[13:37:02.0000] <erlehmann>
AryehGregor, are those food regulations only for orthodox people or do normal religious people also obey them ?

[13:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, they're Quaker Oatmeal Squares (eaten without milk as a snack) and Honey Nut Cheerios (with milk as breakfast).  Currently.  I switch to different cereals sometimes, like once every few months.

[13:37:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I require all of my cereals to have the initials "CC".

[13:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So I guess Cookie Crisp counts.

[13:38:01.0000] <erlehmann>
TabAtkins, Create a CC licensed CC recipe.

[13:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Aw yiss.

[13:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
erlehmann, a baseline definition of "religious Orthodox Jew" is "observes the Sabbath and eats only kosher food".  Most Jews aren't religious, though.  Reform and secular Jews don't believe in keeping kosher, Conservative Jews theoretically do but few of them actually do in practice.

[13:39:02.0000] <erlehmann>
TEH MOAR YOU KNOW

[13:39:03.0000] <erlehmann>
thank, AryehGregor

[13:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, there are about fourteen zillion additional laws to obey beyond the Sabbath and kosher, but those two are among the most visible, burdensome, and socially important, so they're a pretty good indicator of whether you keep most of the rest.

[13:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, I eat those sugary cereals sometimes, but they get tiresome when I eat the same thing for three months in a row.

[13:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I could eat count chocula every single day and be happy with it.

[13:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I don't eat cereal anymore - for several years breakfast was always cheese+crackers+juice, and now I eat eggs most mornings.

[13:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Do jews that don't observe the sabbath and eat only kosher usually ignore it completely, or make up some kind of light/diet version?

[13:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me believes count chocula to be the perfect food.

[13:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Eggs sound like they have to be prepared.

[13:42:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Yeah, but the chefs at google prepare them for me.

[13:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me recently discovered that Dorset Cereals are now avaliable in Sweden

[13:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, a lot of totally irreligious Jews still practice some observance on some of the more interesting holidays.  And they usually practice circumcision, etc.

[13:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, that sounds like an excellent arrangement.

[13:44:03.0000] <jgraham>
That was one of the happiest culinary moments of my time here

[13:44:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me bets that Google's New York office has decent kosher food, given the number of Jews here.

hi i was working with workers in html5 i tried copying one of the ticker example and try to get it wrking from the local browser.. I got this error SECURITY_ERR: DOM Exception 18

[16:39:01.0000] <sid__>
The demo online works fine though...

[16:40:01.0000] <sid__>
this is the reference...

[16:40:02.0000] <sid__>
for the example

[16:40:03.0000] <sid__>
coul any one tell  me what the error is

[16:41:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
sid__: Is your worker hosted at the same origin (protocol+hostname+port) as the page that is running it?

[16:42:00.0000] <sid__>
yeah the HTML source and the "worker.js" files are all on my local folder...

[16:43:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
I'm not sure local files (file:///...) are allowed to run workers...

[16:43:01.0000] <sid__>
hmm

[16:43:02.0000] <sid__>
so ill try putting em into apache.. one sec

[16:45:00.0000] <ap>
sid__: loading from local file should work in Safari

[16:48:00.0000] <sid__>
well it is working.... i need the search.cgi  uri in that resouce... but it works in principle... 

[16:49:00.0000] <sid__>
thanks

[16:50:00.0000] <sid__>
i was actually working with the workers API for Databases... i was working on a Scrapbook plugin that would use webstorage as the backing store...

[16:50:01.0000] <sid__>
Now the problem was that

[16:51:00.0000] <sid__>
with the asynchronus API thigs got hard very fast

[16:51:01.0000] <sid__>
as in all i could do was thru call backs 

[16:52:00.0000] <sid__>
and when i had to do things like insert/update/initialize DB etc operations i decided to sitch to workers

[16:52:01.0000] <sid__>
switch*

[16:52:02.0000] <sid__>
i need now a good lesson to design a simple event based framework ...

[16:53:00.0000] <sid__>
any good  tutorials(JS based) out there on this?

[16:54:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
I'd look at the http://nodejs.org/ API for inspiration

[16:55:00.0000] <micheil>
yeah, I would too.

[16:55:01.0000] <micheil>
(actually, I have no idea what you're talking about, but I highly recommend looking at node.js)

[16:56:00.0000] <sid__>
Hmm thanks

[16:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
can somebody please try selecting and copying-and-pasting text from this page: http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-market-capitalization-microsoft-vs-apple-2010-5

[16:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
...and tell me what you get

[16:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Any text in particular?

[16:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, you mean the "Read more: ..." thing at the end of the copypaste?

[16:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
TabAtkins: yeah

[16:58:02.0000] <hober>
I get the text I copied, and just the text I copied

[16:58:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Interesting.

[16:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm using Chrome 5

[16:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I was trying with Safari

[16:59:02.0000] <hober>
Chrome 6.0.401.1 dev

[16:59:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seemed to not let me copy at all all, it just gives me that "Read more:" bit with the URL


2010-05-27
[17:00:00.0000] <hober>
updating...

[17:01:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
I get "Read more:..." when I copy more than X words.

[17:02:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
around 8 words

[17:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
me finds "{if(b.isPointInRange(c,0)&&!isElementWithoutText.test(a.tagName))return c}else if(e==

[17:02:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
1)i" etc.

[17:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me notices his paste from that JS script got truncated, but that's the culprit, anyway

[17:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, that's just obnoxious

[17:04:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
"aa(b) > 7" --> at least 8 words

[17:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, seems so

[17:04:02.0000] <mbrubeck>
thanks, http://jsbeautifier.org/

anybody know if is there are Java collection class that has a method for just popping the last item off the collection?

[17:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, Stack?

[17:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Stack is one of those do-not-use classes

[17:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
shit.. I was bout to say, me wonders if Stack is deprecated.. most of the obviously useful and simple Java classes are deprecated and replaced by something more complex and opaque

[17:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Do you have to support Java <6?

[17:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: so what do the Java gods mandate that I use instead?

[17:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: no, I think Java 6-only is OK

[17:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
ArrayDeque is great if not

[17:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me checks ArrayDeque doc

[17:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: but, really, is the whole Java-let's-deprecate-everything phenomenon some kind of absurdist joke or something?

[17:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's not deprecation for no reason

[17:25:02.0000] <mbrubeck>
It's because the old container classes were pre-generics

[17:25:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[17:25:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Also, lots of them were sychronized

[17:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[17:26:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Spelled correctly, anyhow

[17:26:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess it's just that every time I find something that intuitively maps to my use cases and programming experiences, I find that's in deprecated

[17:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The good names were taken first, of course :)

[17:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[17:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's not to say you can't use the old classes, they still work. But they're deprecated because the alternatives are generally better.

[17:37:00.0000] <sid__>
btw i dont suppose any one has tried working with workers API in chrome extensions....?

[17:37:01.0000] <sid__>
they dont seem to work in the JS environment...

[17:37:02.0000] <sid__>

if there are any forum admins around (zcorpan?), looks like DaveC426913 is sending spam PMs to people on the forum

[18:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anyone with more than 2 digits at the end of their name (4 if it looks like a year in the last century) is a spam bot automatically.

[18:50:00.0000] <KaOSoFt>
I already reported them. I guess that was the reason for the net split.

[18:50:01.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Perhaps restarted a server?

[18:50:02.0000] <KaOSoFt>
Anyways, time to go home.

MikeSmith: are you in charge of the sites listed in planet html5?

[21:17:01.0000] <boblet>
this might be a good feed to add http://doctype.com/tags/html5

[21:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: yeah, I am

[21:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks at site now

[21:18:02.0000] <boblet>
not quite as active as SO, but similar in a lower level kinda way

[21:18:03.0000] <boblet>
well, less technical

[21:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
can you vouch for these guys?

[21:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Doctype was built by the people who run Litmus - David Smalley, Paul Farnell and Matthew Brindley.

[21:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
(quote from about page)

[21:19:03.0000] <boblet>
btw thanks for adding me yo

[21:19:04.0000] <boblet>
litmus is a compare-in-different-browsers app for web devs 

[21:20:00.0000] <boblet>
don’t know them personally but they haven’t done anything dodgy so far

[21:20:01.0000] <boblet>
they made me a site admin fwiw (not much :)

[21:23:00.0000] <boblet>
oh btw I’m not posting much HTML5-relevant stuff to Tumblr now, so you may want to change my link to http://oli.jp/articles.atom

[21:23:01.0000] <boblet>
most of my content is going to html5doctor.com or books now tho :/

[21:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
losted my connection

[21:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
[12:25]  <MikeSmith> np

[21:25:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
[12:26]  <MikeSmith> I'm kidding about vouching for them

[21:25:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
[12:26]  <MikeSmith> I'll add it now

[21:25:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
[12:26]  <MikeSmith> it looks like a useful resource

[21:25:05.0000] <boblet>
heh

[21:25:06.0000] <MikeSmith>

[21:25:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
dammit

[21:25:08.0000] <MikeSmith>
this train driver loves to hit his brakes

[21:25:09.0000] <MikeSmith>
and make everybody stumble

[21:25:10.0000] <boblet>
woah, that’s a dodgy feeling huh

[21:26:00.0000] <boblet>
well, it is on JR West

[21:26:01.0000] <boblet>
:|

[21:26:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
train drivers should be wired to get an electric shock every time they do that

[21:26:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
this it Odakyu sen

[21:26:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
the only thing worse than JR

[21:26:05.0000] <boblet>
heh

[21:26:06.0000] <boblet>
as long as they stay on the rails I’m happy

[21:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'd rather they also tried harder to arrive on time

[21:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Odakyu is the online train line I've seen in Japan that can't manage to get trains to run on time

[21:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and plus every time it rains, all hell seems to break lose

[21:29:00.0000] <boblet>
maybe they’re using the British Rail model

[21:29:01.0000] <boblet>
leaves on the track! oh noes!

[21:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the other day when it was raining here, they announced "We've had an accident on the ENoshima line, so we will not go all the way to Shonandai (my station), instead we will stop at Sagami Ono".. so, fuck you

[21:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
basically

[21:30:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
there are no other train lines that connect to Sagami Ono

[21:30:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and they gave no info about, if you need to get further down to Fujisawa or whatever, this is what you should to

[21:30:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
*do

[21:31:00.0000] <boblet>
that’s … helpful

[21:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
instead, it was just "get off the train and don't let the doors hit you in the ass on the way out"

[21:31:02.0000] <boblet>
(for taxi companies)

[21:31:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: OK, doctype.com added

[21:31:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
willbchange your ULR now

[21:32:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmith: no rush

[21:32:01.0000] <boblet>
I was actually a bit surprised to see myself there. “I’d just like to thank my family and fans—without them…” ;-)

[21:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

boblet: you have made yourself a member of the cabal, for better or worse

[21:34:01.0000] <boblet>

wow, sweet! looking forward to those holographic member ids you told me about

[21:34:03.0000] <boblet>
the one with hypno-powers

[21:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
now, when people bitch about the "HTML clusterfuck" and the people responsible, you can count yourself among the privileged few they have in mind 

[21:35:01.0000] <boblet>
rock! … umm I think

[21:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so boblet

[21:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you can indulge me

[21:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I have something to share

[21:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I went to the supermarket this morning

[21:48:01.0000] <boblet>
I’m always down for your indulgences

[21:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
to buy some english muffins

[21:48:03.0000] <boblet>
mm muffins

[21:48:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I got to the store and found that they had two brands of english muffins

[21:48:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
and they looked a lot the same

[21:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and were the same price

[21:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I'm confronted with a dilemma

[21:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
how do I choose?

[21:49:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
what process do I use to decide

[21:49:04.0000] <boblet>
elementary. buy one of each and have a taste-off

[21:49:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
I considered the options available to me

[21:49:06.0000] <boblet>
don’t thank me, thank science

[21:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I could, say, try to get some expert advice from the management

[21:50:01.0000] <boblet>
heh

[21:50:02.0000] <boblet>
good luck with that

[21:50:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I could even do a lifeline call to a english-muffin expert somewhere

[21:50:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
or I could attempt to do some detailed analysis there myself, at the stor

[21:50:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
close examination

[21:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean, I could have spent all day there at the store deciding what english muffins to buy

[21:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and agonizing and hand-wringing over whether I was making the right decision

[21:51:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
because, you know, I had to make *some* decision

[21:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I needed english muffins

[21:52:01.0000] <boblet>
obviously

[21:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I had an english-muffing consumer market waiting at home to consume some english muffins

[21:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I thought, I have a risk here of making the wrong decision

[21:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and alienating my english-muffin consumer market at home

[21:53:02.0000] <boblet>
I stand by my scientific experiment suggestion (which would also ensure seconds for your aforementioned consumer market), but other variables worthy of evaluation are

[21:53:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
having them tell me, boy, Mikey, you sure really fucked up that english-muffin-buying decision

[21:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
"what a mess you made of the english-muffin-buying task that you were given responsibility for"

[21:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
etc.

[21:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, you know the punchline

[21:55:00.0000] <boblet>
weight, relative springiness, length of ingredients list, relative average length of ingredients in ingredients list (in both cases shorter=better), and due-by date

[21:55:01.0000] <boblet>
the other option is to just lie and say that’s all they had

[21:55:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, after 10 seconds of agonized though about it, I just grabbed one and took it the counter and paid

[21:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and I got back in time to ship the code

[21:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
er, I mean I got back in time to have breakfast

[21:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, it would be a mistake for anybody to read too much into this little story

[21:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I just felt like sharing

[21:57:01.0000] <boblet>
damn you and your finely crafted metaphors

[21:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
"get a decision made in time to actually eat breakfast"

[21:58:00.0000] <boblet>
don’t forget that it’s entirely possible you would still have got into trouble for choosing the wrong muffin, for no apparent reasons (consumer markets can be unforgiving in the morning)

[21:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, the damned-if-you-do-or-damned-if-you-don'tness of life

[21:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Huck Finn wrote about that

[21:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, Mark Twain did

[21:59:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think Huck's conclusion was, I guess I'll just be damned.

[22:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but he got Jim out to safety

[22:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and he had a pretty good time along the way doing it

[22:00:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and he learned a lot

[22:02:00.0000] <boblet>
“just be damned” that’d make a good quote for the IRC logs header

[22:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Huck shipped the code

[22:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
boblet: oli.jp feed added

[22:11:00.0000] <boblet>
heh, and cheers

[22:11:01.0000] <boblet>

so there's a patch copied into a code.google.com bug report that I would like to e-mail to hsivonen 

[23:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I notice that the code.google.com UI has wrapped and borked it

http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/issues/detail?id=35

[23:05:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
anybody know if there's some way I can get a raw/unwrapped version of the comment?

[23:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me finds that the patchutils distro has a Unwrapdiff command

Nah, two computers

whoa, AI?

[01:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: tag-format="semantics/1.0" is awesome

[01:52:00.0000] <Rich_Clark>
can anyone tell me why there isn't a type="year" in the spec?

[01:53:00.0000] <annevk>
use case?

[01:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey, it's Rich_Clark!!

[01:54:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
HTML5 Doctors are taking over

[01:55:00.0000] <Rich_Clark>
hey Mike

[01:55:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey man

[01:55:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
for the record, I don't have clue about the rational for not having type=year

[01:55:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems to me like it'd be useful

[01:55:04.0000] <Rich_Clark>
anne, I don't have one, someone just asked me the other day and I didn't know so thought I'd see if anyone did

[01:55:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
but as always, whatta I know..

[01:56:00.0000] <annevk>
well, the answer is lack of a use case afaik

[01:56:01.0000] <annevk>
MikeSmith, more than most people, I'd say

[01:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: great to see http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/grammar.dtd 

[01:56:03.0000] <Rich_Clark>
right ok, cheers guys

[01:56:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
keeping hope alive for DTDs

[01:56:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
talk about lack of clue

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Rich_Clark: as far as I am aware, the use cases are addressed by type=number min=something step=1

[01:57:01.0000] <annevk>
even has <meta>, including the broken http-equiv

[01:57:02.0000] <annevk>
awesome

[01:57:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
we really need to have an executive ban on DTDs across working groups

[01:57:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
seriously

[01:57:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
the madness must end

[01:57:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
otherwise these jackasses will still be churning out DTDs 50 years from now

[01:58:00.0000] <Rich_Clark>
hsivonen: yes that's what I advised the guy to use in the end. Cheers

[01:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
is special (NULL | VOID | GARBAGE) #IMPLIED

[01:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
legal in DTDs?

[01:58:03.0000] <annevk>
another ban: if you intend your spec to end up the web browser vendors must be involved; if they're not and you continue ahead anyway you lose the right to complain later on

[01:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm trying hard to un-learn anything I ever knew about DTDs

[01:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: amen

[01:59:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
again, seriously

[02:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
groups of mad scientists off quietly spending years in their remote labs developing Frankenstein monsters

[02:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
then unleashing them on the world and asking that they be welcomed with open arms

[02:58:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hsivonen: i think so, although the html4 dtd usually sets a default value instead of #IMPLIED for enumerated attributes that aren't booleans

[02:59:00.0000] <zcorpan_>

[03:54:01.0000] <Mitsurugi>
hi all

[03:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
hi

[04:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
Does anyone know if it is defined somewhere that new InterfaceObject() and InterfaceObject() are equivalent? Or does it have to be specified on a case-by-case basis?

[04:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I would expect WebIDL 4.4.1 to define this, but it doesn't)

[04:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
(unless I am missing something)

[04:12:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me notes 15.3.1.1 in es5

[04:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan_: That's not relevant

[04:13:01.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan_: That's only relevant for the Function object

[04:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
As in what is bound to "Function" in the global scope be default

[04:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if any work on WebIDL is actually happening

[04:26:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
so for xhr it seems firefox and opera return an object while safari and chrome throw TypeError

[04:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
TypeError is what I would expect given the spec

[04:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
But I don't really trust the spec :)

[04:28:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
although typeof XMLHttpRequest == 'function'

[04:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
That's expected

[04:28:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It's just the difference between [[call]] and [[construct]], so even if it only implements [[construct]] I'd expect that to be true

[04:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[04:29:01.0000] <annevk>
zcorpan_, I don't get that twitter message

[04:30:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: then we're two

[04:30:01.0000] <annevk>
though I've heard the sentiment about not bundling codecs before and "letting the market decide" but I don't really buy that either

[04:30:02.0000] <jgraham>
It is kindof supposed to be an invariant of the language that typeof x === "function" <=> x implements [[call]]

[04:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although regexp objects break that (in some implementations?)

[04:31:01.0000] <annevk>
I think everything with [Constructor] should not have [[call]]

[04:31:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: That would require a change to ECMAScript

[04:31:03.0000] <annevk>
e.g. x = Image() rather than x = new Image() is wrong imo

[04:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh I see

[04:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
Well all the builtins already work like that

[04:32:02.0000] <annevk>
with the same semantics?

[04:32:03.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah

[04:32:04.0000] <annevk>
I thought there was some difference

[04:33:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe I should decide not to care and let someone else figure it out

[04:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
Actually taht's not quite true

[04:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
it is true for Array

[04:33:03.0000] <jgraham>
But not for String

[04:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
String(a) cocerces a to a string primitive, new String(a) coerces a to a string primitive and wraps that primitive in a string object

[04:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
(the language bug here is that String objects exist)

[04:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan_: ah. shows how little I remember about DTDs. I didn't remember that enumerated tokens don't need to be quoted

[04:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
Date is also weird

[04:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
Date() returns a string new Date() returns a Date object

[04:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
has anybody here reviewed and/or commented on http://www.w3.org/2006/WSC/drafts/rec/rewrite.html

[04:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Web Security Context: User Interface Guidelines

[04:39:00.0000] <jgraham>
So basically ES follows [[Call]] === [[Construct]] except for String, Number, Boolean (none of which should exist), Date (which is a mess) and RegExp in the case where the first argument is a preexisting regexp object

[04:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: Did they have any browser vendors involved in writing the document?

[04:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, some

[04:40:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Ian Fette was somewhat involved in that WG at times

[04:40:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
don't know about recently

[04:40:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I was in the group long ago too

[04:40:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
when I was working at Opera

[04:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
some Mozilla security folks too

[04:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: you got other document.write tests? you saw abarth discussion over on #webkit?

[04:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or other "crazy parsing" tests

[04:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
other than html5lib ones

[04:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: btw, I guess I need to try finishing the v.nu checker code I was writing for script element text-content checking

[04:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I might be bugging you for test cases

[04:47:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: ok

[04:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I really hate that part of the spec

[04:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: just Hixie's tests and sicking's tests in mochitest on m-c

[04:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ah, OK

[04:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I figured you guys might have written some new tests after the document.write-related evangelism bugs that came up

[04:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
iirc at least there were some document.write-related ones

[04:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh, and then http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/detect-html5-parser.html has an evil document.write test that WebKit doesn't pass :-)

[04:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
excellent

[04:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what is being discussed in #webkit

[04:57:00.0000] <Peter`>
jgraham: they're working on an HTML5 tokenizer

[05:00:00.0000] <slartsa>
does an iframe go over all z-indexes?

[05:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: is there any reason I should not (or could not) create two separate checker classes for script checking?

[05:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that is, one for http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/scripting-1.html#restrictions-for-contents-of-script-elements

[05:03:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and one for http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/scripting-1.html#inline-documentation-for-external-scripts

[05:05:00.0000] <slartsa>
oh, wrong channel

[05:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan_: I think I may have already finished my attempt at implementing support for http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/scripting-1.html#inline-documentation-for-external-scripts

[05:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for the script/@src case

[05:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that part of the checking

[05:06:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmith: cool

[05:06:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
deployed on http://www.w3.org/html/check

[05:06:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
for testing

[05:19:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
should we make buffered.start() and end() work without an argument?

[05:19:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
defaulting to 0 for start and buffered.length-1 for end?

[06:22:00.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan_: sounds a bit odd, did anyone ask for that?

[06:26:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
foolip: no

[06:26:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
foolip: i thought it would be a convenience shortcut

[06:27:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i think webkit acts as if undefined was passed as argument if you don't have any, which will be converted to 0

[06:28:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
whereas opera would throw WRONG_ARGUMENTS_ERR

[06:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
/me notes that there's <meta name=application-name> that installable web apps could use

[06:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan_, yes, I mentioned application-name in my reply on whatwg earlier.

[06:41:00.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan_: is WebKit or Opera wrong?

[06:43:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
foolip: behavior is undefined (in webidl)

[06:44:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
foolip: webkit has the ecmascript-like behavior

[06:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2009AprJun/1171.html

[06:46:00.0000] <foolip>
undefined?

[06:46:01.0000] <foolip>
oh my

[06:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
foolip: No other behaviour really makes sense in ECMAScript

[06:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
foo() should be exactly like foo(undefined) if foo takes a single formal argument

[06:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, wait

[06:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
You are complaining about the behaviour being undefined

[06:52:02.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, that sucks

[06:57:00.0000] <boblet>
Rich_Clark: hey hey!

[07:01:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: re: form input for type=year", what about adding the year of a wine on corkd.com?

[07:02:00.0000] <boblet>
annevk: alternatively, is there a way to get year-only input validated/via an appropriate browser widget?

[07:05:00.0000] <Rich_Clark>
boblet: hey mate

[07:05:01.0000] <boblet>
good to see you’ve answered MikeSmith’s siren call

[07:06:00.0000] <boblet>
(he’s luring us all onto the rocks of the cabal y’know)

[07:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
walk towards the light

[07:06:02.0000] <boblet>
I’m pretty sure Gollum said the opposite

[07:07:00.0000] <boblet>
I must be in the wrong movie

[07:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
I read that as "rocks of the canal" and wondered what kind of braindead architects would design a shipping channel with obvious hazartds to navigation

[07:07:02.0000] <boblet>
jgraham: now there’s a loaded metaphor

[07:50:00.0000] <erlehmann>
can anyone tell me whats so wrong with the audio element used in here that chrome does not play it ? http://blog.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/podcast-podcasts-feat-sikk

[07:50:01.0000] <erlehmann>
maybe i am using it wrong …

[08:04:00.0000] <erlehmann>
seems to be this http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=33437

[08:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
erlehmann, that's not working in Opera either. I don't know why

[08:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, it works when I load it locally

[08:14:00.0000] <erlehmann>
but Content-Type is: audio/ogg … Lachy, does it have to be more specific ?

[08:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, that should be fine

[08:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: I've had troubles when audio is sent with Content-Encoding: gzip

[08:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
(which it looks like yours is)

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Should try disabling compression for that file

[08:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
The content-encoding shouldn't affect playback. If that's the cause, file a bug so we can get that fixed

[08:18:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Philip`, how do i check for compression ?

[08:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: "curl --compressed -I http://daten.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/audio/podcasts/podcasts-feat-sikk.oga" would do it

[08:19:01.0000] <erlehmann>
the resource tab in chrome says it spends 6ms to wait for the resource, then cancels after 1ms

[08:22:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i'll see what wireshark says about google chromes behaviour

[08:41:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: looks like the latest 3.6.4 stabilized the memory issues.

[08:42:00.0000] <asmodai>
At least, that's the initial idea. Need to test some more, obviously

[08:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
asmodai: ok. have you tried on trunk?

[08:54:00.0000] <asmodai>
hsivonen: not yet

[09:23:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Philip`, it plays now. Thank you.

[09:23:01.0000] <erlehmann>
!seen mpilgrim

[09:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: Because of the gzip thing?

[09:31:01.0000] <erlehmann>
Philip`, seems so.

[09:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I'm trying to consider the ABNF in http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/scripting-1.html#inline-documentation-for-external-scripts in terms of what the error cases are that v.nu would need to report about

[09:32:00.0000] <erlehmann>
i'll shoot mpilgrim a mail, his server also serves gzipped ogg content

[09:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
erlehmann, mpilgrim reads logs here.

[09:32:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I know one is the same as with the style element

[09:32:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
You should be able to say something and he'll come in to respond later.

[09:32:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least in my experience.

[09:32:05.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: I expect it'd be good to file bugs on any browsers that fail in that case

[09:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is too lazy to file bugs himself but doesn't mind suggesting other people do the work

[09:33:01.0000] <erlehmann>
Dear log-reading mpligrim, I suggest you add this rule to the .htaccess file at diveintohtml5.org: SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \.(?:oga|ogv|ogg)$ no-gzip

[09:33:02.0000] <erlehmann>
Best regards,

[09:33:03.0000] <erlehmann>
erlehmann

[09:33:04.0000] <erlehmann>
:D

[09:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
You know he saw it if it turns up in yellow

[09:34:01.0000] <jgraham>
:)

[09:35:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Lachy, does it work in opera now ?

[09:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
error message: "Content contains the character sequence \u201c<!--\u201d without a later occurrence of the character sequence \u201c-->\u201d."

[09:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and another is "Content contains the character sequence "<script>" without a later occurrence of the character sequence "</script>"

[09:36:01.0000] <erlehmann>
hmm, does opera even have a public bug tracker ?

[09:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
erlehmann: The public can submit bugs

[09:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just not actually be informed of any progress on them.

[09:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Opera now officially has the least open bug tracker of any browser vendor.

[09:37:02.0000] <erlehmann>
Sounds like lots of dupes.

[09:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I whine at the Opera employees here about it sometimes, but they haven't managed to get it fixed yet.

[09:37:04.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Opinions on the merits of this vary

[09:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
erlehmann, what, as opposed to the public bug trackers where half the bugs filed *aren't* dupes?  :)

[09:38:01.0000] <erlehmann>
anyone with opera can check if http://blog.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/podcast-podcasts-feat-sikk plays now ? i am on throttled UMTS

[09:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, yes, yes, I know.  I'll continue to make fun of you as long as you're more secretive than Microsoft, though.

[09:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
Microsoft has a secretive bug tracker

[09:38:04.0000] <Philip`>
They just have a public one in addition to it

[09:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So that's less secretive than Opera, then.

[09:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I don't think that makes it clear which is most secretive overall

[09:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which has only a secret bug tracker.

[09:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
Opera has forums and blog posts where people complain about bugs

[09:39:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I imagine Apple also has a secret bug tracker for tracking non-WebKit Safari issues, unless that's also public?

[09:39:05.0000] <Philip`>
which are basically public bug trackers

[09:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
(just without any good bug tracking features)

[09:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, because you don't get told what the status is.

[09:40:02.0000] <jgraham>
If we did get a public bug tracker I imagine it would be disconnected from our internal one

[09:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, by that argument, me complaining to jgraham on IRC is a public bug tracker.

Apple has rdar

[09:40:05.0000] <jgraham>
or whatever it is called

[09:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doesn't touch anything manufactured by Apple with a ten-foot pole, so doesn't have reason to know

[09:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
Complaining on IRC is not like filing bugs. On the other hand I personally have looked through the desktop blog comments for useful bug reports

[09:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
The signal to noise is pretty low though (at least for the bugs that I care about rather than "this UI element is 2px off from where I would ideally like it") 

[09:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
(which might be bugs that someone else cares about)

[09:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Signal-to-noise drops drastically as you make the bug tracker more accessible.  This is inevitable.

[09:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it makes an influential subset of users (the more techy people, who care most about the difference between browsers and understand them best) feel better.

[09:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Sure. I understand all the arguments for public bug trackers

[09:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And I understand all the ones for private bug trackers.

[09:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
However, I operate on the theory that there is some level of persistent whining that will maximize people's chances of agreeing with you, and informal observational evidence suggests to me that this optimal level is nonzero.

[09:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Well in your case you are whining at the wrong people :)

[09:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I mention it occasionally when it comes up, to increase Opera employees' exposure to discontent about the status quo and bias them toward supporting a public bug tracker the next time it comes up internally.

[09:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well.

[09:47:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Worth a try.

[09:47:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
If all else fails, whining is fun anyway.

[09:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me cannot be expected to conduct meaningful analysis on who the best person to whine at is in an organization whose internal structure is opaque, so just goes with the theory that everyone is responsible for everything.

[09:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I guess it is typically the case that the people working the most in public are not the ones arguning for more closedness. So anyone you can find to whine to is unlikely to be the right person to whine to.

[09:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
A good point.

[09:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll be sure to only mock Opera for fun from now on, with no intent of accomplishing any useful goals.

[10:37:00.0000] <bellHead>
What is the current state of browser support for <datagrid>s?

[10:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Wasn't datagrid removed for now?

[10:43:00.0000] <bellHead>
That would be annoying, it's the capability I'm most looking forward to.

[10:43:01.0000] <bellHead>
Where would I find out if it had been removed?

[10:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It has been.

[10:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Months ago.

[10:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not enough implementation, I think, or not enough interest, or too complicated, or some combination of the foregoing.

[10:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
My impression was it would return in some future version, but it was thought best to concentrate on other things for this round.

[10:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(i.e., the next few years)

[10:45:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, too much work remaining on more basic elements

[10:46:00.0000] <bellHead>
/me curses quietly.

[10:46:01.0000] <bellHead>
Oh well, thanks for the info.

2010-05-28
[18:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yay, Zack Weinberg is advocating a TeX glue approach to flexbox again.

[18:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Real yay or ironic yay?

[18:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Real yay.

[18:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TeX is awesome.

[18:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's both powerful and elegant.

[18:17:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
From the parts he's described, though, glue's pretty simple, and can be done in my proposed draft.

[18:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wish CSS were more like TeX.  Too bad there are major incompatibilities: fixed vs. fluid layout, and Turing-complete vs. guaranteed performance.

[18:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, glue is conceptually simple.  But it gives you incredible power, since you can use it everywhere in TeX.

[18:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I support using flex anywhere in CSS that doesn't cause problems.

[18:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
To match TeX's typography, you'd want to allow CSS to permit glue values to be given for things like word-spacing, and with separate values for things like before and after dashes, commas, periods, etc.

[18:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
And separate values inside all the different places in an equation you might want to put it.

[18:19:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which generally means "in every layout mode except block layout".

[18:19:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
TeX is fundamentally macro-based, though, so it will always be more powerful.

[18:19:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[18:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If we ever get a sufficiently complex text-layout model, I'd probably see flex in it.

[18:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would be cool if CSS were ever as good as TeX for serious typography.

[18:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but performance gives us some obvious limits on what we can do.

[18:22:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some kind of inline style would be essential, though, and that would be really painful without macros.

[18:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, we could compromise on performance for print at least, no?

[18:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
On-screen, typographical details aren't that important.  Exact spacing is locked to multiples of a pixel anyway, so it's not as precise.

[18:23:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Certainly, but that would mean producing a complex CSS module for the sole purpose of printing.  That's less desirable from an input->reward standpoint.

[18:23:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, maybe.

[18:23:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Too bad.

[20:35:00.0000] <boblet>
AryehGregor, TabAtkins : re: “Exact spacing is locked to multiples of a pixel anyway, so it's not as precise” not once screen dpi goes up. 300dpi displays are a way off yet, but they’ll come. greater rez = less pixel restrictions

[20:38:00.0000] <boblet>
also I feel that fundamentally CSS should aim to produce typography the equal of anything else. It won’t be long before tech books being made as websites isn’t a rarity, with PDFs for print generated from them

[21:05:00.0000] <roc>
Exact spacing is already not locked to multiples of a pixel

[21:06:00.0000] <roc>
Gecko does subpixel positioning of text on Mac

[03:34:00.0000] <annevk>
ooh, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is out?

[03:34:01.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders if it's good

[04:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh, cool

[04:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Another Mario game for you to not complete!

[04:09:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: It's a mario game made by Nintendo. If it wasn't good it would be... surprising

[04:09:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Indeed :)

[04:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: However I should point out that you were way more hopeless than me

[04:10:01.0000] <annevk>
fanboii alert

[04:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
Moi?

[04:10:03.0000] <annevk>
toi

[04:10:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: On that level, yes. But there are other times when I've been better than you.

[04:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Probably. I suck at computer games

[04:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
But Mario is teh awesome

[04:12:00.0000] <annevk>
guess i better dust off my wii and connect it again

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk>
which reminds me, I still have that other mario game to finish

[04:13:01.0000] <annevk>
never did anything beyond three levels or so

[04:13:02.0000] <jgraham>
Which one?

[04:13:03.0000] <annevk>
the one in the red box

[04:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
That's the one I was playing with gsnedders

[04:14:01.0000] <annevk>
super mario wii or some lameass title

[04:14:02.0000] <jgraham>
New Super Mario Brothers Wii

[04:14:03.0000] <jgraham>
I think

[04:14:04.0000] <annevk>
there you go

[04:14:05.0000] <hsivonen>
is fanboii with two 'i's a wii fanboi?

[04:14:06.0000] <annevk>
i thought that would make sense

[04:14:07.0000] <annevk>
with a single it's Apple :)

[04:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah, unless one is at the start in which case it is apple

[04:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I see

[04:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
I wonder if that would be fun over the internet... part of the charm of playing with four people in the same room is cursing each other

[04:22:00.0000] <annevk>
it's better in the same room, but if you've a shared audio channel it's pretty good

[04:22:01.0000] <annevk>
at least with halo

[04:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, jgraham, you and the others in Sweden got me addicted to Super Mario. I even went out and rented it when I was back in Aus and had a Wii available.

[04:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
sadly, I don't have a Wii in Norway, but I wish I did.

[05:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Well, you didn't get addicted enough to buy a Wii then :)

[05:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm serioulsy considering getting one :-)

[05:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
when I can afford it

[05:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I know graphics aren't the point with Wii, but what's the fanboi explanation to the lack of digital video output (HDMI mainly)?

[05:08:03.0000] <Lachy>
but given that I've just moved and have to buy a whole lot of expensive furniture and applicances, it's not a top priority

[05:09:00.0000] <annevk>
seems like the perfect opportunity to squeeze in a fun appliance

[05:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
what outputs does it have? Just component video?

[05:10:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, 540p max

[05:10:01.0000] <annevk>
(iirc)

[05:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: No idea

[05:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
Presumably cost saving or something

[05:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[05:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, wikipedia says 480i, 480p and 576i are supported. 540p would be a very strange video size

[05:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
I have a pure consumer electronics relationship with my Wii. I have no more knowledge of, or interest in, the hardware than I do with my food processor

[05:13:01.0000] <annevk>
ah, 576i it is then

[05:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, since the wii came out in 2006, I think that was before HDTV and HDMI was really popular among average consumers.

[05:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
If they come out with a new HD Wii, then I would expect it to have HDMI

[05:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wasn't aware that HDTV was really popular among average consumers today

[05:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the devices are. the content no so much.

[05:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it's getting more popular. Most new TVs being sold today are flat panels, and I belive most of them have HDMI inputs

[05:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I mean, you can't buy a non-HD TV anymore

[05:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
Apparently over half the people who played Gears of War 2 on the 360 don't have HDTV

[05:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
are CRT TVs still availalbe anywhere at all?

[05:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
and I'd expect such people to be more technologically advanced than the average consumer

[05:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
(http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/epics-mark-rein-interview?page=3)

[05:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't have an HDTV yet myself. I might be getting a second hand one soon though

[05:27:00.0000] <annevk>
Gears of War without HDTV would be quite unfortunate

[05:29:00.0000] <brucel>
process question for you w3c process afficianados: <track> element is in whatwg version of spec, but not latest w3c from 23 May http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/ (that I can find). why is that?

[05:31:00.0000] <annevk>
accessibility community complained about the proposal being in the specification (specifically the WebSRT format)

[05:31:01.0000] <annevk>
the chairs also complained

[05:32:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie then proceeded to omit the entire proposal from the W3C copy

[05:33:00.0000] <annevk>
not sure anything has changed, but at least the outcry stopped

[05:42:00.0000] <brucel>
thanks annevk

[05:43:00.0000] <brucel>
wouldn't everything be much duller without two parallel-ish specs?

[05:44:00.0000] <annevk>
we'd be back to XHTML2

[05:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
They're not parallel specs, they're matryoshka specs - you can choose to read a page of the author subset of the W3C subset of the WHATWG's HTML5 subset of WA1

[05:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is all a subset of what people call HTML5

[05:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
brucel: FWIW, the changes to the outliner are non-trivial, and I'll implement them when I rebase it upon Anolis 2

[05:58:00.0000] <brucel>
thanks snedders

[06:06:00.0000] <sid__>
Hi I was inserting some text from a HTML Dom nodes innerHTML into websql data store. i wanted to have a rough estimate of the size of the text I am going to insert(In bytes). So i can check against the size of the initilaized data base object... Now how do I know how many bytes each char is roughly occupying in the websql store?

[06:07:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/28/mozilla_and_opera_want_vp8_in_html5/ -- did I miss the email to the list somehow? :)

[06:09:00.0000] <sid__>
example doc.firstChild.parentNode.outerHTML.length (doc = document.getElementsByTagName('HTML')) gives me a value of 50815 for a certain webpage... But the size of the doc in chrome debugger resources in 20Kb...

[06:10:00.0000] <sid__>
Or is there a method in websql to determine how much space is left?

[06:11:00.0000] <annevk>
1) ECMAScript is based on 16-bit code units

[06:12:00.0000] <annevk>
2) The backend can be in any encoding the browser picks though...

[06:14:00.0000] <sid__>
annevk: so the browser may show a different size based on the encoding.. Hmm Now if I am putting the outerHTML into a websql data store how could I know how much space is it actually going to occupy ?

[06:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
sid__, you can't, since it's entirely implementation dependent

[06:16:00.0000] <annevk>
sid__, you don't; compression could be used, etc.

[06:17:00.0000] <sid__>
Here is the problem... When we do a call   db = openDatabase('documents', '1.0', 'Offline document storage', 5*1024*1024) and then say keep using the webstore.. there seems no way to actually know how much space is a already occupied so web app can increase it some how?

[06:18:00.0000] <sid__>
as in is there a way to know that?

[06:18:01.0000] <sid__>
May be some one who worked on websql stuff...

[06:18:02.0000] <sid__>
could get some magic going here :)

[06:21:00.0000] <sid__>
i am actually making a scrapbook extension for google chrome exploiting websql..... So from the space usage perspective I need to deal with this issue...

[06:21:01.0000] <annevk>
the API is somewhat crappy

[06:22:00.0000] <sid__>
There is only a QUOTA_ERR error taht tells me... Kinda hard to base your programming around errors...

[06:51:00.0000] <mayly>
Philip`, are you the one philip with the web font optimizer page?

[06:53:00.0000] <brucel>
Question r/e <track>. The spec currently says "The src attribute gives the address of the time track data. The value must be a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces. This attribute must be present." Can it not be optional if there is a descendent <source> element, so that different formats can be fed to different browsers (a la <video> itself)?

[06:54:00.0000] <annevk>
we don't want separate formats for <track>

[06:54:01.0000] <annevk>
we don't want them for video either, but it seems for track we can avoid it

[06:56:00.0000] <annevk>
brucel, <track> is currently like <source> or <img>, it has no end tag and such

[06:58:00.0000] <brucel>
True, we don't want separate formats for anything. But it doesn't look like there's much agreement on such things as formats? (And what happens when Hixie's children dream up WebSRT+ or something like that?)

[06:59:00.0000] <annevk>
seems browser vendors have agreement to some extent to do SRT + extras

[06:59:01.0000] <annevk>
if we ever need a new format later we can figure out a migration path then

[07:00:00.0000] <annevk>
designing for a theoretical future always goes wrong

[07:00:01.0000] <brucel>
isn't the obvious migration path t

[07:00:02.0000] <Philip`>
mayly: Yes

[07:01:00.0000] <annevk>
brucel, see the topic; there's no obvious when it comes to the web

[07:01:01.0000] <mayly>
Philip`, do you know the tex-gyre fonts?

[07:01:02.0000] <brucel>
.. to make it like video itself and allow descendent <source> elements? Speccing that now while there are no implementations would seem to be better

[07:02:00.0000] <annevk>
if we never end up using it that would be quite a waste

[07:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
mayly: No

[07:02:02.0000] <mayly>
Philip`, these are redistributable and modifyable free fonts which correspond to the standard postscript fonts. they are based on the urw-fonts used by ghostscript, extended with vietnamese and eastern european characters and are available as otf

[07:08:00.0000] <mayly>
Philip`, they were initially rubbered up for use in TeX but provide them in multiple formats: http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/

[07:08:01.0000] <annevk>
aah, so jgraham is already reading the html5lib moderator emails

[07:09:00.0000] <annevk>
/me already wondering what was up

[07:12:00.0000] <mayly>
Philip`, also with latin-modern http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/latin-modern there is an opentype variant of the computer-modern font, used in TeX, aaand finally there are "libertine" and "biolinum" from the http://linuxlibertine.sourceforge.net/ project

[07:13:00.0000] <mayly>
Philip`, especially the latter has a keyboard-key-style variant which would be great for use in software documentation

[07:14:00.0000] <brucel>
annevk, is there an idea of what webSRT file suffix will be, eg is it <track kind=captions src=blah.wsrt> ?

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
mayly: Thanks, I don't think I'd seen those before

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
mayly: I haven't done any work on the font thing for quite a long time, but it's possible I'll update it eventually and those might be good ones to add to the list

[07:20:01.0000] <annevk>
brucel, .srt

[07:21:00.0000] <mayly>
Philip`, glad to help :)

[07:33:00.0000] <brucel>
annevk, thanks. By the way, I'm planning to use your line "designing for a theoretical future always goes wrong" to explain to my wife why I'm buying a vintage Les Paul guitar instead of putting some money aside for my daughter's school fees.

[07:34:00.0000] <annevk>
brucel, only if you show it to me one day :p

[07:40:00.0000] <brucel>
annevk you're on. We'll play it over a few pints of your Jenever beer.

[07:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
brucel, are you suggesting that your daughter going to school is only a theoretical future?

[07:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm trying to understand how that quote can actually be used to explain why you need some fancy guitar

[07:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe he's predicting a financial crash, where only physical objects like guitars will retain their value

[07:48:00.0000] <brucel>
Lachy, she might turn out not to be bright enough for Uni; there might be some kind of apocalypse before that (I recently watched a documentary called 2012 about all the bad things that might happen). 

[07:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Might? Surely you mean "will".

[07:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, by "school fees", did you mean university fees, rather than normal fees for primary school or high school, which I assume are significantly less

[07:49:02.0000] <brucel>
philosophically, all future is theoretical, I guess. Whereas vintage Les Pauls are tangible. In fact, they weigh a bloody tonne

[07:51:00.0000] <brucel>
Lachy, in the socialist utopia that is the UK, schools are free. Except for aristocrats who go to exclusive fee-paying schools called (counter-inuituively) "public school". But I confused the issue of shamefully using the American way of referring to higher education as "school". I'll be saying "awesome" next

[07:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
brucel: You can always sell the guitar when she has to go to university. Downside: you will fell like you are in Bon Jovi

[07:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
*feel

[07:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
brucel, in NSW in Australia, public schools have voluntary fees, which you are expected to pay if you can afford it, and which most people do, cause they're quite reasonable. I'm not sure about other states, but assume they're similar.

[07:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, and by public schools, I mean what you call state schools, as opposed to private schools, that you call public schools.

[07:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If all fails, you can just move to a country with free high education

[07:59:01.0000] <brucel>
we had it in the UK; finished just after I graduated. Hopefully no cause and effect there

[07:59:02.0000] <daedb>
Dashiva: Like Sweden? :)

[08:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
how does sweden afford to give free higher education?

[08:00:01.0000] <daedb>
high taxes

[08:00:02.0000] <Lachy>
ah, right.

[08:00:03.0000] <daedb>
I don't remember exactly where we are right now, but we have some of the highest taxes in the world iirc

[08:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, it's funny to hear people from low tax countries complain about taxes

[08:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
No, funny is when they make it sound like news that they are going to be taught in school that low taxes and small goverment are good when it is pretty clear that they are already taught that

[08:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or polls showing people think 20% of the budget goes to foreign aid

[08:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or poor people protesting against state supported healthcare

[08:11:01.0000] <jgraham>
No wait, that's sad not funny

[08:14:00.0000] <daedb>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Income_Taxes_By_Country.svg is pretty interesting.

[08:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, Germany and Belgium have insanely high taxes

[08:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
One tax rate doesn't tell the full story, of course. They could have much less in other areas.

[08:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
It also doesn't tell you how they averaged

[08:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I assume the average is calculated as the sum of all tax rates for tax payers, divided by the total number of tax payers. i.e. the normal way to calculate an average.

[08:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: It's at least unclear that a simple mean is the most useful quantity since it is heavilly biased by outliers

[08:28:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It says "The 'Personal rate' is the average rate of income tax for a worker on the average income in that country."

[08:28:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Doesn't say what average "average income" is

[08:31:00.0000] <daedb>
The numbers are from OECD, I assume they've got information about that somewhere :p

[08:31:01.0000] <Dashiva>
OECD sounds like some sort of organization with some sort of agenda, they obviously can't be trusted unless I can confirm they agree with me

[08:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, when you have such a large population, surely a relatively small number of outliers won't have a significant impact on the average.

[08:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There's a probably a big difference between mean and median, though

[08:33:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(which would skew based on income inequality in each country)

[08:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Really the size of the population is irrelevant. It's the income distribution that matters

[08:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
High taxes & "free" university makes a lot of sense if too many people don't move between participating and non-participating countries between education and contributing in taxes

[08:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
wow. the U.S. has a surprisingly high corporate tax rate

[09:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: still around (assuming not...)

[09:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Yes

[09:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: in the office?

[09:42:02.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Will leave in about 10 minutes if the rain stops

[09:42:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I'll come to the office now

[09:42:04.0000] <jgraham>
or at least gets marginally less bad

[12:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I recommend only details receive focus and that the summary be a label for it.

[12:37:01.0000] <Dashiva>
In other words <summary> should not support tabindex

[12:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Why so?

[12:37:03.0000] <Dashiva>
From bug 9817

[12:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Seems like that would make it harder to activate <details> using the keyboard

[12:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That also makes the activation behavior weird wrt faking, too - the natural thing is to let the <summary> be the target for whatever events trigger a toggle.

[12:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And the implied semantics there are screwy.

[12:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: There's no need, and certainly no particular desire, to map every element into ARIA semantics.  They're just exposed when reasonable.  Elements carry their own semantics around without ARIA's help - the mapping table is used more to *restrict* what you can do with ARIA than anything else.

[14:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why doesn't someone define some XML-like thing that gets rid of all the useless stuff like doctypes and whitespace handling, and has basic error handling, but isn't insane like text/html, then try to define that as a third serialization of HTML and get browsers to support it?

[14:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Whitespace handling?

[14:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: likely because everyone who cares enough about markup formats is in the XML camp already.  ^_^

[14:53:02.0000] <hober>
AryehGregor: sounds like anne's xml5

[14:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, XML defines at the syntax level that whitespace is irrelevant, then is forced to work around that because of things like <pre>.  It would make more sense to say that generic whateverML processors have to treat all whitespace in text nodes and attributes as significant, and let languages worry about exceptions like <pre>.

[14:54:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So a generic processor can't reformat the file, no big deal.

[14:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hober, kind of, except it could be made simpler at the same time.

[14:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Getting rid of actively bad features like DTDs that processors are supposed to actually fetch, and bad things like version specifiers, and so on.

[14:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This would make it simpler to implement from scratch, as a side bonus.

[14:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you can't fully learn the syntax in 20 minutes, it's probably a bad generic data format.  :)

[14:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you can't describe the syntax in a diagram on a single page, it's a bad generic data format.  ^_^

[14:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Pretty much.

[14:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I hadn't realized that XML says that whitespace is irrelevant at the syntax level.  That seems silly.

[14:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, basically, just define it in the stupid way that everyone knows what XML is: you've got your tags, and quoted attributes, and they have to nest properly, and that's about it. Oh, entities for escaping.

[14:58:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Surely the correct level for that is the application.

[14:58:03.0000] <hober>
"One Page Principle: A specification that will not fit on one page of 8.5x11 inch paper cannot be understood." -- Mark Ardis

[14:58:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, that's why you theoretically need to do xml:white-space="preserve" or something like that, on <pre> and such.

[14:58:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's stupid.

[14:58:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think it was following SGML.

[14:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or something.

[14:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know how SGML handled whitespace, and don't want to.  :)

[14:59:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, they broke from SGML tradition in so many places for good reasons; I dont' see why they wouldn't do it everywhere.

[14:59:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I hear you.

[15:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think you could do acceptable generic error handling.  Like if there's a mismatched closing tag, then if it matches some open tag, assume the intervening closing tags were omitted; and if not, ignore it.

[15:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not nearly as good as text/html, of course, so it would still be a break, but not terrible.

[15:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe could be improved a bit without becoming too complicated.

[15:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And re:  <TabAtkins> Also: likely because everyone who cares enough about markup formats is in the XML camp already.  ^_^

[15:01:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, I think that would be about the ideal level for a generic mechanism.

[15:01:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Except us.

[15:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but we generally thing text/html is "good enough" so we dont' bother with it.  And then we go use JSON or something for everything else.

[15:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
text/html is horrible.  The only reason we don't all want to brutally murder it is because implementations have to support it anyway, so it's a sunk cost.

[15:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Surely a new format could improve worst-case parsing performance, for instance.  Any other possible benefits?

[15:03:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess if there are no big benefits to authors, then it doesn't matter, because implementers will always need to support text/html anyway.

[15:03:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would have to be more verbose than text/html, necessarily.

[15:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There is marginal benefit, in that it presumably is simpler to write?

[15:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Why so?

[15:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because it's generic, so it can't allow omitting end tags freely, for instance.

[15:04:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
You'd have to do <img /> and </p> and such.

[15:04:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure it can.  You just described the recovery mechanism.  ^_^

[15:04:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, I know the advantage.

[15:04:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would let you use DOMs that are impossible in text/html.

[15:04:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
For some things, at least.

[15:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is that an advantage?

[15:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sure.  It would be great if we could allow more things in <p>, for instance.

[15:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's one actual (minor) advantage of XHTML2.

[15:05:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, right.  Yeah, that's a benefit.

[15:05:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
<p>'s restrictions are dumb.

[15:05:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, it would behave more predictably if you make mistakes.

[15:05:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
text/html is insane.

[15:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you put things where they shouldn't belong, it will do crazy unpredictable things like reparent them.

[15:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There was some other benefit I'm forgetting.

[15:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, the point is, text/html is evil and it would be great if we didn't have to force it on people.

[15:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The syntax of a better-xml is trivial to write out as a grammar, anyway.

[15:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, I guess you'd need to specify <head> and <body> and <html> and such explicitly all the time.

[15:07:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's more verbosity.

[15:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[15:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could skip the doctype, though.

[15:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I rather enjoy omitting them.

[15:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Me too.  :(

[15:08:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
But you could just say they can be omitted from the DOM if unnecessary.

[15:08:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I just treated them like talismans, anyway.  I'd always write "</head><body>" on the same line.

[15:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So "<link ... /><p>Foo</p>" would parse to a DOM that actually had no <head> or <body>.  That sounds evil, though.

[15:09:01.0000] <mbrubeck>
I don't think most web developers even know that you can omit things like <head>, so no loss to most people.

[15:09:02.0000] <mikl0>
What MIME Media Type should I use for a document XHTML 1.0 Transitional?

[15:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
mikl0, either text/html or some XML MIME type, depending on what you want to do with it.

[15:10:00.0000] <mikl0>
AryehGregor: I want to traverse and manipulate the DOM. Thank you.

[15:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
mikl0, that's not clear enough.  Are you serving it to web browsers, or XML processors, or both, or neither?

[15:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Editing it locally?

[15:13:00.0000] <mikl0>
AryehGregor: Yes to web browsers and XML processor.  If I understand correctly.  Editing locally you mean on what?

[15:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
mikl0, if you want it to work in Internet Explorer, serve it as text/html.

[15:13:02.0000] <mikl0>
AryehGregor: I don't. I also have SVG in it.

[15:14:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
then use application/xhtml+xml

[15:14:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
mikl0, inline using namespaces?  Then an XML MIME type is necessary for all browsers except Firefox 3.7, which will support it either way.

[15:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, thinking about it, I don't see any real reason why <html> or <body> or <head> is needed in the DOM.  Do you?

[15:14:03.0000] <mikl0>
in an iframe as I thought I could not do inline.

[15:14:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: I don't know enough to say.

[15:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe we'd want to require <html>, just to have something to style as the root element, and also so that you know it's HTML.

[15:15:01.0000] <mikl0>
mbrubeck: thank you

[15:15:02.0000] <mikl0>
AryehGregor: thank you

[15:15:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
mikl0, try text/html and see if that works for you.  If not, switch to application/xhtml+xml.

[15:16:00.0000] <mbrubeck>
AryehGregor: And you want <head> to be styled as display:none so that the contents of <title> don't appear... but I guess if you could allow a missing <head> to replace an empty <head>.

[15:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
mbrubeck, you can style title as display: none.

[15:16:02.0000] <mbrubeck>
AryehGregor: Oh yeah, good point

[15:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anything that can be put in both head and body should be display: none in both cases, so we're fine.

[15:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Firefox explicitly does that in their UA stylesheet anyway.

[15:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But yeah, just setting "title,script,style,link,meta,base { display:none; }" in the UA stylesheet should cover all the in-head elements.

[15:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So you wouldn't necessarily need a <head> in the dom.

[15:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've used <body> as an extra implicit wrapper for CSS.

[15:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm pretty sure I rely on that on aryeh.name.

[15:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But you could always just type it if you wanted it.

[15:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've definitely done that too, but yeah, you can just type <body> rather than just relying on it to be generated.

[15:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think all body attributes could just as easily go on html.

[15:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which I do think we'd want to remain required.

[15:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just use <ml>.  ^_^

[15:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Clearly that's a character advantage over xml already.

[15:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, it's useful to be able to distinguish HTML from MathML from SVG by sniffing the first few bytes.

[15:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, I see.

[15:24:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So it's just a mimetype issue.

[15:24:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
You want auto-syntax highlighting and such.

shepazu: we are in the process of removing svg load event from non-<svg> elements. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=552938

[01:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
when I emailed the WG about the event, I didn't realize it applied to other elements per spec

[05:20:00.0000] <openstandards>
Hi there 

[05:21:00.0000] <openstandards>
currently putting together an html 5 marked up site and was wondering about some semantics 

[05:22:00.0000] <openstandards>
I've got a menu for a hotel and i'm wondering if an article with nested sections would be the best way to go

[08:55:00.0000] <alise>
So I shouldn't use Ruby html5lib since it's unmaintained, yes?

[10:33:00.0000] <alise>
html5lib using cElementTree is returning None for a perfectly valid html5 doc

[10:33:01.0000] <alise>
what gives?

[12:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Woah, the STIX fonts got released

[14:20:00.0000] <kamathln>
Hi, I have a suggestion for html5 I would like to make. (I am a total noob here, so plese, go gentle)

[14:21:00.0000] <kamathln>
where do I propose the new idea

[14:27:00.0000] <kamathln>
anybody around?

[14:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
kamathln: The WHATWG mailing list is probably the best place for detailed proposals

[14:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
though you could mention it here first since people might be able to quickly point out common mistakes :-)

[14:30:00.0000] <kamathln>
Philip`: cool! Then here it is: I hope I am not suggesting something already suggested 

[14:30:01.0000] <kamathln>
My idea is to have an option attribute to all tags that need to load external resources than the page itself . The name would be "priority"

[14:32:00.0000] <kamathln>
The user agent can, depending on priority of the external resource, decide whether to download the resource, the order , the bandwidth , etc .. 

[14:33:00.0000] <kamathln>
Like I may have a small css file which contains essential classes like error class, and those that differentiate the widgets . I would like to give it high priority 

[14:34:00.0000] <kamathln>
Another css that pulls in a bunch of whacky, heavy backgrounds and other images that spruce up that page can be given low priority

[14:34:01.0000] <kamathln>
the same can be applied to javascript as well.

[14:34:02.0000] <kamathln>
Philip`: what say?

[14:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That doesn't sound all that useful

[14:36:01.0000] <Dashiva>
For stylesheets, at least

[14:36:02.0000] <kamathln>
Dashiva: Okie, may be wrong example .. Think in terms of images .. 

[14:36:03.0000] <Dashiva>
If the style changes randomly a while after loading the page, that wouldn't be a good user experience

[14:38:00.0000] <kamathln>
Dashiva: If the connection is that slow, wierd behaviour is gonna happen anyway. So its better we give priorities to essential resources

[14:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If the connection isn't slow, priorities don't matter

[14:39:01.0000] <kamathln>
yes. Thats the point

[14:40:00.0000] <kamathln>
it does actually! If I am doing research, and I dont care about the looks of the page as much as content, I could switch off *non-essential* images

[14:40:01.0000] <kamathln>
priorities need not always be in numbers 

[14:41:00.0000] <kamathln>
they could be something like "essential" "non-essential" 

[14:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
kamathln: Have you seen http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F ?

[14:48:00.0000] <nielsle>
kamathlin: There are firefox plugins to disable flash advertisements, but I don't think that many website providers will help us avoiding to read advertisements. Maybe there is a conflict of interests

[14:48:01.0000] <kamathln>
My suggestion to whoever wrote that section: Examples give much better voice to the bulletted lists. 

[14:48:02.0000] <kamathln>
Philip`: thanks for pointing though, Will try following it.

[14:49:00.0000] <kamathln>
nielsle: My idea is to hardly avoid advertisements. In fact , for my specific case, I use elinks as long as possible. When I really need to look at an image or there is videom I switch to firefox 

[14:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
kamathln: Probably the most important thing is to start by identifying problems that are worth solving (I guess it's something like wanting pages to be usable as quickly as possible), rather than starting with a solution (a priority attribute) and then trying to list problems it might solve

[14:52:00.0000] <nielsle>
I think that gmail has a link that allows you to use a simpler html-based version of the site. Maybe such a link is the best way to solve the problem, but of course it would be nice if the webservice could discover automatically from the data provided by the client. 

[14:52:01.0000] <kamathln>
Philip`: thanks 

[14:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
since e.g. the problem of loading pages faster might be better solved by browser developers spending more time on speculative parsing and HTTP pipelining etc, which would benefit all pages, rather than adding support for a new attribute that would only ever be used by a tiny fraction of pages

[15:14:00.0000] <kamathln>
Philip`: nielsle: thanks a tonne for the feedback and guidance .. its past my bedtime. Cya on Monday

hey all. what happened on the omnibus element removal change? is that still ongoing?

[06:59:00.0000] <boblet>
(issue 91, 93, 95-7 etc)

[14:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
Gah, people with questions that I should have answered that failed to stick around until I could actually answer them

[14:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
for the record, I think ElementTree is somewhat broken in html5lib 0.90; if you use namespaceHTMLElements=False it returns nothing

[14:06:02.0000] <jgraham>
This is fixed on trunk

[14:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
(oh sorry it is broken with namespaceHTMLElements=True)

[14:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/issues/detail?id=138

[14:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Also, STIX fonts? That must explain the flying pigs

[14:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
and the sunshine in Sweden

[14:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I guess there ought to be a 0.91

[14:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well there ought to be a 1.0 too...

[14:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but 0.91 might be more achieveable)

[14:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: There ought to be many things.

[14:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: There ought to be few things

[14:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's enough things already :-(

[15:21:00.0000] <krijn>
If a site doesn't work with html5.enable on in Fx, does anybody in here care?

[15:21:01.0000] <gsnedders>
krijn: hsivonen 

[15:21:02.0000] <krijn>
I thought so

[15:21:03.0000] <krijn>
http://www.doctors-inc.com/

[15:22:00.0000] <krijn>
There's a comment open in the <style> tag, but it's never closed

[15:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hah. Are we going to have to copy what's done for script into style?

[15:23:00.0000] <krijn>
Obviously a bug on that site, but it's working in browsers..

[15:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
It looks like it parses correctly in http://parsetree.validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.doctors-inc.com%2F

[15:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
Are you using a recent Firefox nightly?

[15:24:02.0000] <krijn>
No

[15:24:03.0000] <krijn>
Probably fixed?

[15:24:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Probably

[15:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
3.6?

[15:25:01.0000] <krijn>
Okidoki, nothing to see here, move along

[15:25:02.0000] <krijn>
Philip`: yes

[15:25:03.0000] <Philip`>
That's apparently ancient and never intended to be usable

[15:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The new parser was committed just before the 3.6 release branched off, or something like that, if I remember correctly)

[15:27:00.0000] <krijn>
But I can't order a breast enlargement now!

[15:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: The ought to be many things indeed

[15:27:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Noooooooo...

[15:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: But no red

[15:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: That's not what you changed my whiteboard to say.

[15:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
Your whiteboard should say sleep++

[15:28:03.0000] <jgraham>
gn

[15:28:04.0000] <gsnedders>
nn

[15:28:05.0000] <gsnedders>
See you tomorrow (unfortenately)

[15:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
I see you forgot all the lessons in charm already

[15:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
:p

[15:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
:D

[15:29:03.0000] <gsnedders>
You were talking about how I should treat a girl, not about guys.

[15:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
s/a girl/girls/

[15:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(To avoid ambiguity in the fact that I meant "a girl" meaning "any girl")

[21:43:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
What exactly does this mean? "Table column 13 established by element col has no cells beginning in it."

[21:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
GPHemsley: it means the table is malformed because the col element makes the table algorithm expect there to be a cell in a certain place but the later table markup does not actually produce the expected cell

[22:00:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
the only thing I can think of is that there is a colspan="2" but never two column separately

[22:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
GPHemsley: if you have a test case I'd be glad to take a look also

[22:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it could actually be a bug in the v.nu table-integrity-checking code

[22:11:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
MikeSmith: This is what I'm working on ATM: http://gphemsley.org/linguistics/en/trace_table.php

[22:11:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
and it's broken as it currently stands

[22:11:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
(=invalid)

[22:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
weird

[22:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it has 13 columns, right?

[22:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
unless I'm counting wrong

[22:13:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
right now, all of the cells in the beta/V(PASS) column are colspan="2"

[22:13:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
or unless it counts the first as zer

[22:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[22:14:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
and the 13th column would be the second column in that span

[22:14:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
AFAICT

[22:14:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
which, indeed, does not currently exist anywhere

[22:14:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, yeah, I see what you're saying

[22:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so you have no col element at all, I see

[22:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh, sorry

[22:15:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see now

[22:15:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
colgroup/col

[22:15:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
yeah

[22:15:05.0000] <GPHemsley>
it's mention in a <col> and in @colspan, but no <td> or <th>

[22:16:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
IOW, it's only mentioned implicitly, not explicitly

[22:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
what happens if you just delete the colgroups and cols?

[22:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems like it doesn't have any effect on the rendering at least

[22:28:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
hmm... incidentally, it considers it an error if you don't have the same amount of cols/colgroups as your table

[22:28:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
(I at first only commented out the one colgroup)

[22:29:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
MikeSmith: It still complains, it appears

[22:29:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
"Table column 13 established by element th has no cells beginning in it."

[22:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
GPHemsley: maybe I'm being daft, but I can't understand why you have a colspan=2 on the column at all

[22:37:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
because it's a WIP :)

[22:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's a normal column, right?

[22:38:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
I plan on adding more rows to the table ;)

[22:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[22:38:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
and some of them will have two-column entries under that header

[22:40:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
so, what's the verdict?

[22:40:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
is it a bug?

[22:40:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
not a bug

[22:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you change all your <td colspan="2">&empty;</td> for that column

[22:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in the body of the table

[22:41:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
change those to <td>&empty;</td><td>&empty;</td>

[22:41:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it validates

[22:41:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
right, as I would expect

[22:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, so what it is telling you is that you have set up an unneeded colspan=2 column all the way down

[22:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess

[22:42:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
yeah, makes sense

[22:42:03.0000] <GPHemsley>
although it's a little weird that it's an error, IMO

[22:42:04.0000] <GPHemsley>
(rather than a warning)

[22:42:05.0000] <GPHemsley>
but IDK what the spec says to do

[22:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, me neither

[22:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I suspect that if Henri has the code reporting it as an error, it's because the spec says it's an error

[22:43:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
:)

[22:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
now, whether the spec should define it as an error or not is arguable, I guess

[22:45:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me pokes hsivonen and Hixie 

[22:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
<BoazSender> @paul_irish will be sorely missed: http://twitpic.com/1sn5pn

[22:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
beautiful

[22:49:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess that image is the work of f1lt3r 

[22:50:00.0000] <f1lt3r>
haha

[22:50:01.0000] <f1lt3r>
you guessed right

[22:50:02.0000] <paul_irish>
very nice work, al. :)

[22:50:03.0000] <paul_irish>
<3z

[22:50:04.0000] <f1lt3r>
haha

[22:50:05.0000] <f1lt3r>
what you doin in here?

[22:51:00.0000] <f1lt3r>
yeah i thought you'd get a kick out of it

[22:51:01.0000] <paul_irish>
i'm sweeping my old apt. about to leave it for the last time. and you know.. hanging out on IRC

[22:51:02.0000] <f1lt3r>
crazy times!

[22:52:00.0000] <boaz>
I definitely laughed!

[22:52:01.0000] <f1lt3r>
hey what the wg are you doing in here too?!

[22:52:02.0000] <f1lt3r>
/me checks to see if his grandma is in here too

[22:54:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
/me wonders why <col style> still isn't supported in Firefox...

[23:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
krijnh: the <!-- in style thing is fixed on trunk

[23:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
so anyone know what's going on with the issues that went to poll last month?

[23:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
sorry, earlier this month, not last month

[00:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: nothing visible going on as far as I can tell

[02:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me fails to see the multitouch-relevance of http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9822

[02:15:00.0000] <aho>
huh?

[02:15:01.0000] <aho>
what's that bug report even supposed to mean?

[02:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Welcome back :)

[02:33:00.0000] <boblet>
MikeSmithX: here’s a report of the Fukuoka HTML5 event in Gigazine, in case you missed it: http://gigazine.net/index.php?/news/comments/20100529_html5/

[02:33:01.0000] <boblet>
your dearly departed mustache makes an appearance, may it rest in peace

[02:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me encourages security-minded folks to think about http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9659#c2

[02:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm a bit disappointed that no one from Microsoft shared any insight on http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9767 even though I advertised it on public-html

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
shepazu: any news on the load event from the SVG WG?

[02:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
shepazu: should I send email amending my change request to request that the load event be dropped from non-<svg> elements altogether?

[02:51:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
boblet: thanks

[02:52:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I got Shimokawa-san's mail about that but hadn't looked yet

[02:52:01.0000] <boblet>
aah ok

[02:52:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
seems like a very good writeup

[02:52:03.0000] <boblet>
seems like everyone enjoyed it, which was good

[02:52:04.0000] <boblet>
yeah

[02:53:00.0000] <boblet>
bbl

[04:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I assume you failing the html5lib tests like <!DOCTYPE html><p><b><i><u></p> <p>X is deliberate? Do you have a bug for the spec change you anticipate?

[04:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the test that fail due to space character interaction of space characters with formatting elements are known

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
*tests

[04:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: and deferring fixing is deliberate

[04:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: You consider it a bug in the spec or in gecko?

[04:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: whether the failure itself should be considered deliberate isn't quite so clear to me, but I tend to think that it'd bad to make "in body" sensitive to spaceness

[04:28:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I consider it a bug in Gecko, but more careful thinking might persuade me to consider it a bug in the spec

[04:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think how forcefully I will consider it a spec bug will depend on performance metrics that I don't have at this time

[04:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: OK, thanks. Maybe we should have a list on a wiki page or something of possible issues? I seem to recall that there were some other things that you considered bugs in the spec?

[04:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: the other spec bugs are on file

[04:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Is there a list somewhere?

[04:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: except I think Hixie avoided fixing one bug I had filed before and I should take the time to repursue

[04:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(that was about freezing src, async and defer)

[04:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: you get a list if you search for bugs reported by hsivonen⊙if in the W3C bugzilla

[04:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the src, async defer thing is only detectable if you document.write a script start tag, then use the DOM to modify the element and then write the end tag

[04:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: but yeah, we should probably have a wiki page

[04:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: any ideas for the title? "Possible bugs in the HTML5 parsing algorithm according to hsivonen"? :-)

[04:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/ParserIssues

[04:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: ok

[04:43:02.0000] <jgraham>
Does that list seem complete

[04:43:03.0000] <jgraham>
?

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I'm adding the missing bits

[04:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Thanks

[04:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: updated

[04:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
great

[05:05:00.0000] <boblet>
anyone know what’s up with HTML5 + ARIA? Wasn’t there a combo spec? I found Mike’s H:TML (ARIA edition) but it’s Sept 2009, so I’m guessing not being updated…

[05:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
boblet: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/content-models.html#annotations-for-assistive-technology-products-%28aria%29

[05:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
boblet: so ARIA still lives in its own specs and HTML5 references those

[05:11:00.0000] <boblet>
hsivonen: aah, naruhodo. Yeah I’d found that, but obviously needed to read the first sentence more thoroughly

[05:11:01.0000] <boblet>
AT is a rather sad state of affairs. Luckily NVDA is eating their lunch so they’ll be forced to evolve or die

[05:13:00.0000] <boblet>
couldn’t believe the attitude of Window-Eyes devs; ‘spec not finished so not worth our time til then’ O_o

[05:13:01.0000] <boblet>
doesn’t help that they have major bugs with new elements + landmark roles either

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
boblet: "spec" being ARIA or HTML5?

[05:14:01.0000] <boblet>
hsivonen: HTML5

[05:15:00.0000] <boblet>
oh, is ARIA not doe either? har! well I guess that reasoning means they don’t really need to support anything then

[05:15:01.0000] <boblet>
s/doe/done/

[05:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
boblet: ARIA is at WD

[05:18:00.0000] <boblet>
“Not only is HTML5 still in draft, there are parts of ARIA that are sill not completely set in stone. This is another reason why providing some sort of release time frame is difficult; the technologies are a moving target” http://www.mail-archive.com/gw-info⊙gc/msg10851.html

[05:19:00.0000] <boblet>
so they appear to be waiting, although not until 2022 it seems

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
boblet: I guess they haven't gotten the memo about the interdependency of spec maturity and implementations

[05:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I did some hacking to the v.nu datatype code today in an attempt to improve error-reporting for IRIs a bit 

[05:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: cool

[05:24:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
current results: http://www.w3.org/html/check?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fbugzilla.validator.nu%2Fattachment.cgi%3Fid%3D177

[05:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
compare to current source: http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fbugzilla.validator.nu%2Fattachment.cgi%3Fid%3D177

[05:25:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
trying to make the messages a little more user friendly

[05:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., instead of "DNS_LABEL_DASH_START_OR_END in HOST", "Host component contains a DNS name with a - (dash) character at the beginning or end."

[05:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
etc.

[05:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
along the way, discovered a couple of other IRI-checking cases that it seems like should be reported as warnings instead of errors

[05:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: that's great!

[05:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think there's probably a few cases I missed

[05:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but anyway, for those cases, it'll just fall back to reporting them the same way as the existing code

[05:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[05:30:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, will send you a patch after I test it some more

[05:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[05:30:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
and maybe if I can get zcorpan_ to throw some other test cases at it

[05:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
about the Jing patch: I need to check what kind of copyright bureaucracy the project requires (if any) before I land the patch

[05:31:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[05:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[05:32:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
no rush, anyway

[05:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me MikeSmith I take it that you are contributing the Jing patch the same way as other V.nu patches, i.e. under the same license as the file being patched and waiving notices?

[05:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
doh

[05:33:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[05:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess that was supposed to be a DM

[05:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah

[05:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
good thing you didn't reveal any secrets of the inner cabal there

[05:34:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, yeah, same terms as always

[05:34:04.0000] <annevk>
you guys keeping secrets? ooh

[05:34:05.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[05:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There are no secrets... that you know of

[05:37:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: all of it is stuff you already signed an NDA on too

[05:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
annevk: plus remember the blood-brother ceremony

[05:37:03.0000] <hsivonen>
a new binary release of the V.nu parser is long overdue

[05:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but every time I get close to the point of releasing, there's still One More Thing to fix first...

[05:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[05:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
this time the changes to named character references in attribute values

hsivonen: because of a spec change?

[05:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
recent spec change?

[05:39:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yeah

[05:39:03.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: fairly recent

[05:39:04.0000] <hsivonen>
before that, my excuse was </a> and </font> in SVG

[05:45:00.0000] <boblet>
hsivonen: …or the one about how being involved is a good thing :/ oh well, what can you do. With the free NVDA already supporting ARIA and some HTML5 too…

[05:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah cool, Opera 10.6 gots onhashchange

[05:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does it have WebM?

[05:51:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: no

[05:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
:-(

[05:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>

Localization is important

[06:06:02.0000] <Peter`>
but yeah, the idea is quite.. original

[06:06:04.0000] <svl>
actually: http://twitter.com/memowe/kirchen-die-twittern

[06:07:00.0000] <annevk>
great

[06:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
Awesome. Now all we need is someone to implement NTP over Twitter. :-)

[06:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
can't fail

[06:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
... or Twitter Time Protocol

[06:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I guess you could get second precision via twitter, which is enough for normal human use

[06:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not sure you could even get that level of precision any more. It may have been possible when they were sending out tweets in near real time when they had Jabber support.

[06:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
But I don't think it's possible with the current API setup that, AIUI, needs to be done by the client polling twitter for updates at regular intervals.

[06:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Surely you could just use a timestamp from an HTTP header in the response from the Twitter API, instead of looking in the actual tweet to work out the time

[06:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
or would that be considered an unacceptable layering violation?

[06:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: The server isn't required to return the right value

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: It's even less required to return the right value in the response body

[06:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Presumably the contents of the response body count as application-level semantics

[06:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
It's true that twitter doesn't make any promises

[06:54:02.0000] <jgraham>
So using twitter for time would probably be a bad idea

[06:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
The inefficiency of twitter for this purpose doesn't seem to stop people from trying http://twitter.com/CurrentTime

[06:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
The inefficiency of twitter for any and all communications doesn't stop people trying

[07:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess now my only excuse for not making a release of the V.nu parser is the 8000 byte limit

[07:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so it will be slow unless run with a special VM switch

[07:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if I should make a release anyway or develop a workaround...

[07:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should develop a workaround...

[07:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I redeployed V.nu without your recently landed patches and mine

[07:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[07:24:00.0000] <variable>
hsivonen: what is v.nu ?

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
variable: validator.nu

[08:48:00.0000] <aliok>
hi everybody

[08:49:00.0000] <annevk>
hi hi

[08:49:01.0000] <aliok>
can anyone direct me a good demo of Html5 <output> element?

[08:50:00.0000] <aliok>
Btw, I am working on my GSoC project Apache MyFaces Html5 Support: http://wiki.apache.org/myfaces/GSoC2010_HTML5

[08:51:00.0000] <annevk>
aliok, http://www.whatwg.org/demos/2008-sept/widgets/demo2.html

[08:51:01.0000] <annevk>
oh oops

[08:51:02.0000] <annevk>
looks like Hixie used a <span> rather than <output>

[08:51:03.0000] <annevk>
anyway, that <span> there should be <output> :)

[08:52:00.0000] <aliok>
yeah, I see :)

[08:52:01.0000] <aliok>
thanks

[08:53:00.0000] <aliok>
but, what about @for @mode and @defaultValue attributes? any example using them? especially @for?

[08:55:00.0000] <annevk>
defaultValue is a DOM attribute

[08:55:01.0000] <annevk>
for allows you to couple it to the input box; can be useful for screen readers

[08:55:02.0000] <annevk>
they prolly do not implement that yet but maybe in the future

[08:55:03.0000] <annevk>
and I've no idea what mode is

[08:55:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Where did you hide your O'Caml HTML5 parser?

[08:55:05.0000] <annevk>
in other news...

http://www.w3.org/2010/05/31-svg-minutes.html#item05 -- "<AlexD> Given how long it will take HTML5 to mature (i.e. PREC) then perhaps SVG needs to take some lead in an HTML(4)+SVG integration profile... HTML5 is a bit of vapourware right now really."

[08:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
Good lord, who are these people and which universe do they live in?

[08:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I cunningly hid it on the internet

[08:56:03.0000] <hsivonen>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=558036 hasn't landed, yet, so @for support can't be demoed in Gecko plus screen reader yet

[08:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
who is AlexD?

[08:57:01.0000] <aliok>
thanks annevk

[08:58:01.0000] <annevk>
aliok, where did you find "mode"?

[08:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Thanks

[08:59:01.0000] <karlushi>
Alex Danilo was? working for Canon

[09:09:00.0000] <annevk>
he's listed as invited expert; I think I met him once, back in the CDF / WICD days...

[09:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me gets peckish, looks for food in his flat, and realizes he has almost none. That seems problematic.

[09:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
You could take up a religion that enforces fasting until sunset

[09:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, adopting such a religion in this part of the world would be torture during summer.

[09:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I realise :)

[09:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: (alternatively I recommend exchaning money for food)

[09:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: That means walking past work, and that seems too much like reminding me that I'm not a free bird.

[09:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: You have too little route planning imagination

[09:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[10:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
I love the fact that even though the STIX fonts have been released, there will be no LaTeX versions for another year

[10:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does that mean a real year, or a STIX "year"?

[10:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess it means a STIX year

[10:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
Which could be as much as a decade

[10:26:02.0000] <jgraham>
to those using normal calendars

[10:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
I suppose a consistent viewpoint would be that the STIX people are moving at a highly relatvistic velocity with respect to the rest of us

[10:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders to what extent the notation of modern mathematics is driven by font availability rather than by more traditional factors like readability

[10:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I assume that e.g. Leibniz could write down the integral symbol without having to care whether it was already supported by his typesetting package)

[10:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
(but nowadays it takes far too much effort to make up completely new symbols)

[12:57:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
MikeSmithX: If you're interested, this is now much more complete: http://gphemsley.org/linguistics/en/trace_table.php

im working on some css3 animations. anyone in here know about matrix syntax for the filter prop in IE?

[13:41:00.0000] <boaz>
MikeSmittXX

[13:42:00.0000] <boaz>
do you know who i would talk to about IE css filter matrix syntax?

[13:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
boaz: You should probably talk to Microsoft people

[13:47:00.0000] <boaz>
Philip :(

[13:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
or use http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533014(VS.85).aspx

[13:47:02.0000] <boaz>
yah, im on msdn, the matrix syntax seems to not be documented

[13:47:03.0000] <boaz>
er, at least, the syntax for what I want do

[13:47:04.0000] <boaz>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533014(VS.85,loband).aspx

[13:48:00.0000] <boaz>
im looking for something like this: matrix(a, c, b, d, tx, ty)

[13:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
It looks like it's just a list of the specified properties - progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Matrix(m11=1, m12=0, m21=1, m22=0, dx=0, dy=0)

[13:54:00.0000] <boaz>
philip: hmm

[16:46:00.0000] <roc>
where's the HTML5 parser test suite that you can run in a browser?

[16:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
roc: http://gsnedders.html5.org/html5lib-tests/runner.html

[16:48:00.0000] <roc>
great thanks

[16:48:01.0000] <roc>
do you know if it tests SVG-in-HTML?

[16:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
It includes http://gsnedders.html5.org/html5lib-tests/data/tests11.dat

[16:49:01.0000] <roc>
/me looks

[16:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
and http://gsnedders.html5.org/html5lib-tests/data/tests10.dat

[16:49:03.0000] <roc>
great thanks

[16:49:04.0000] <Philip`>
which look like SVG tests
