[16:00:00.0000] <foolip>
anyway, I'm pretty sure #whatwg is not the perfect place to discuss this

[16:03:00.0000] <foolip>
nessy: thanks for the tweets :)

[16:07:00.0000] <nessy>
there's also a blog post waiting :)

[16:07:01.0000] <nessy>
but I need to get breakfast first

[16:08:00.0000] <nessy>
oh, I thought anything html5 related can be discussed here! sorry!

[16:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can, nobody cares.

[16:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's interesting to read, and no one else is discussing anything here right now anyway.

[16:11:00.0000] <foolip>
nessy: you're waiting to read or to write a blog post?

[16:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Anything unrelated to HTML5 can be discussed here too, and often is

[16:12:01.0000] <foolip>
hehe, indeed

[16:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
Socks are great, aren't they?

[16:12:03.0000] <foolip>
/me goes off to learn about git hooks

[16:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Happy new year, y'all!

[16:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
nessy: Everything is on-topic here :P

[16:19:00.0000] <nessy>
I'm in the middle of writing a blog post about how cool it is that Opera released this :)

[16:20:00.0000] <nessy>
I wanted to get it working on my mac with ports, thought, but that's obviously not going to happen :)

[16:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Of course Opera is cool :P

[16:20:02.0000] <nessy>
I only care about video ;)

[16:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, I'll say that Carakan in the cool thing in 10.50, just to spite foolip :)

[16:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Are you only allowed one cool thing per release?

[16:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, no. But what I worked on most is by definition the coolest.

[16:22:01.0000] <daedb>
http://9elements.com/io/projects/html5/canvas/ is awesome :O

[16:24:00.0000] <foolip>
nessy: sorry :/ I borrowed a MacBook over the weekend so I can hack on it though

[16:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is a seriously awesome real-life application of canvas: http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html

[16:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least if you're a math nerd.

[16:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Old.

[16:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hides

[16:37:00.0000] <nessy>
foolip: no worries - I will just install it on my winodws and linux partitions :)

[16:37:01.0000] <nessy>
but if I could have hacked it together on Mac, that would have been a bonus :)

[16:40:00.0000] <foolip>
I think there's ample opportunity for hacking on Linux still

[16:41:00.0000] <doublec>
foolip: nice job on the <video> release!

[16:41:01.0000] <foolip>
doublec: thanks!

[16:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So, I take it 10.5 > 10.10?  Why not 10.50?

[16:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: It is 10.50.

[16:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why does everything call it 10.5, then?

[16:42:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Anything that calls it 10.5 is technically wrong.

[16:43:00.0000] <foolip>
did we call it 10.5 anywhere?

[16:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=opera+10.5

[16:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
AVL did in the blog post for the new year's build, seemingly

[16:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
my.opera.com and labs.opera.com, at least.

[16:43:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
And yeah, Anne's blog.

[16:43:05.0000] <foolip>
oh well

[16:43:06.0000] <gsnedders>
I don't think it overly matters. People call 10.10 10.1 too :)

[16:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And I saw it on Slashdot too, and as we all know, Slashdot is very reliable in its headlines and summaries.

[16:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Blatantly we should just call it Evenes and be done with it.

[16:44:02.0000] <foolip>
perhaps our version number are floats, not a major.minor scheme

[16:44:03.0000] <gsnedders>
And call 10, 10.01, and 10.10 Perigrine (or however you spell it).

[16:44:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then why not use 10.1 instead of 10.10?

[16:44:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Then there's no ambiguity whatsoever!

[16:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Peregrine?

[16:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Whatever the codename for all those releases was.

[16:45:02.0000] <foolip>
heh, the Opera employee gets told how to spell the Opera release

[16:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, "peregrine" is a regular old English word.

[16:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was just guessing.

[16:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Like I can spell anyway. :)

[16:46:02.0000] <foolip>
Peregrine is Presto 2.2, i.e. Opera 10

[16:46:03.0000] <foolip>
Evenes is Presto 2.5, i.e. Opera 10.5

[16:46:04.0000] <gsnedders>
No, the Desktop releases based upon Presto 2.2

[16:46:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hides

[16:47:00.0000] <foolip>
/me slaps gsnedders 

[16:47:01.0000] <foolip>
I'm lying, the version numbers are right, but the codenames are for desktop releases, not core (presto) releases

[16:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hah. The Presto Wikipedia page has changed it's opinion again of what Presto release Carakan was added in.

[16:47:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*its

[16:48:00.0000] <foolip>
thank god, Wikipedia sets the record straight

[16:48:01.0000] <foolip>
(i.e. since we don't know we can always trust Wikipedia)

[16:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(Well, Peregrine is also the codename of the Core branch of 2.2 for Desktop...)

[16:48:03.0000] <foolip>
meh, what's the point of git hooks if you can't but them under version control?

[16:49:00.0000] <foolip>
put

[16:49:01.0000] <foolip>
b + gravity -> p

[16:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: You'd like it if cloning and using an external git repository (even if you never use the code it contains) could result in it executing arbitrary hook scripts on your system?

[16:51:00.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: you may just have a point

[16:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether to move to using 10.50 as his main browser at home (where he really really really doesn't want his browser to crash as he always has way too many tabs open)

[17:01:00.0000] <foolip>
gsnedders: do you compulsively need to create a minimized test case every time something crashes?

[17:01:01.0000] <foolip>
if so, keep it out of your home ;)

[17:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
gsnedders: That's like wondering whether to replace your pet parakeet with a pet elephant when your wife collects 9th century china

[17:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, you should watch the Mythbusters episode on bulls in a china shop.

[17:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They set up racks of china and let a whole bunch of bulls loose to run around.

[17:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And they ran right between the shelves repeatedly and didn't knock over a thing.

[17:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It was pretty hilarious.

[17:12:03.0000] <Dashiva>
That's bulls

[17:12:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Elephants are... somewhat wider

[17:12:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you'd need more space between the shelves for an elephant, obviously.

[17:12:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean the stands, or bookcases, or whatever you're putting the china on.

[17:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, that's the thing, you don't usually consider "would an elephant fit here" when decorating your home

[17:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Depends what sort of guests you have, I suppose.

[17:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
A pet elephant seems like a terrible idea regardless of your china collection habits

[17:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
For a start, you'd have to deal with all the footprints in your butter

[17:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You don't have to let it walk in your butter.  You could train it to not climb onto tables and so on.

[17:26:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It doesn't climb the table, it gets in the fridge

[17:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hopefully more effectively than our cats, who are trained not to climb onto tables if any people are around to watch.

[17:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you'd have to be cleverer to stop them from getting into things, I guess, what with the trunk and all.

[17:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Most pets are too small to open the fridge.

[17:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I imagine that if you had a pet elephant, it would be best kept outside.

[17:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(I'm sure *someone* out there has a pet elephant.  I read about a lady who had like twenty pet lions in her house or something.  She apparently got a permit and everything, totally legit.)

[17:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(This is a vague memory, though, so reality might be less entertaining, as usual.)

[17:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, I'm off for the night.  Good night, and happy new year to whoever has recently experienced or will imminently experience the dawn of a new year.

[17:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me won't experience the dawn, he'll be in bed by the time the sun's coming up

[17:33:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm still waiting for the galaxyrise myself

[18:31:00.0000] <noahlt>

[21:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the static versions of the author view of the HTML5 spec now have toc.js and dfn.js enabled 

[21:49:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/

[21:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/spec.html

[21:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so each page of the multipage version now has an on-page TOC

[21:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and if you click on terms on bold that are <dfn> instances, it'll show you backreference to all the hyperlinks to that term

[03:28:00.0000] <gsnedders>
foolip: No, I just don't want my browser crashing in general :)

[04:11:00.0000] <annevk>
happy new year

[04:46:00.0000] <annevk>
thanks nessy, glad we made you happy with a video release :)

[04:46:01.0000] <annevk>
was a surprise to me too to be honest

[04:48:00.0000] <nessy>
it's totally awesome

[04:49:00.0000] <nessy>
seeking is still required to make it useful, but it's awesome :)

[07:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone know of any blog software that uses a serializer for all output?


2010-01-02
[18:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: hey, neat, can we get the cross-referencing dfn.js set up for the multipage full copy too?

[18:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
what would i have to add to my pipeline?

[18:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey Hixie

[18:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you add it to your build that should be all that's needed

[18:45:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
what I'm doing for the author view is just hacking it in

[18:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the splitter just copies the dfn.js reference into the split-out files

[18:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
afaict

[19:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I remembered something else I've been wanting to bug you about

[19:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
when you have a chance, please see:

[19:03:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://qa-dev.w3.org:8888/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fdev.w3.org%2Fhtml5%2Ftests%2Fvalidation%2Ffull%2Finvalid%2Fmissing-attributes%2Flink-missing-

[19:03:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
href.html

[19:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
oops

[19:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://qa-dev.w3.org:8888/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fdev.w3.org%2Fhtml5%2Ftests%2Fvalidation%2Ffull%2Finvalid%2Fmissing-attributes%2Flink-missing-href.html

[19:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh so dfn.js doesn't actually work cross-file?

[19:04:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: well, no

[19:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh ok

[19:04:05.0000] <Hixie>
nevermind then

[19:04:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
no magic -- only works within the 

[19:04:07.0000] <MikeSmith>
same file

[19:04:08.0000] <Hixie>
i disabled it on the whatwg copy because it wasn't particularly useful without that

[19:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks at the file

[19:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, it may be that I should disable it in the multipage author view too

[19:05:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
see the attributes list in the error message

[19:05:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
the "(required)" stuff

[19:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I added that by patching the copy of the HTML5 spec that v.nu uses

[19:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
10-line change

[19:06:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://pastebin.ca/1734693

[19:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so.. I wanted to as if you could consider making that change to your source 

[19:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or something similar

[19:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
html5 used to have those, i took them out because very few attributes really are required vs optional, most have complicated rules about whether to have them in or not

[19:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
so i figured it would be misleading to say "required" or not

[19:08:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, for the v.nu case, I think it's useful

[19:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. title="" is required on <link>... if rel="stylesheet alternate"

[19:08:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
right

[19:08:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
but v.nu catches those cases and reports them

[19:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but the spec would be misleading if it said "required" for href="" but not title=""

[19:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
because title="" isn't optional in all cases

[19:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, I see your point

[19:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so, OK, it may be that this is really only useful for the v.nu messages

[19:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that it's useful in validators, though maybe it should explicitly say what is missing, since i was a bit confused when first looking at the error message

[19:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
gotta go, bbiab

[19:10:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[19:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but yeah, that's the core problem -- the relaxng/jing backend doesn't give useful error messages about missing attributes

[19:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the backend doesn't report which attributes are missing

[21:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
happy new year

[22:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[22:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
happy 2010 :-)

[22:06:00.0000] <jtbandes>
/me wants nested CSS, e.g. #main { foo:bar;... p { baz:quux; ...} } == #main { foo:bar; ..} #main p {baz:quux;}

[22:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
jtbandes: write a python script to translate it to standard css

[22:09:01.0000] <jtbandes>
Ew..

[22:10:00.0000] <jtbandes>
I could, but that would make it almost as hard to deal with as non-nested CSS

[22:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
why?

[22:11:01.0000] <zcorpan>
debugging gives a different view?

[22:11:02.0000] <jtbandes>
eh?

[22:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh nm, i was thinking of dragonfly and similar

[23:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: any news on the microdata thing?

[00:35:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
http://blog.jclark.com/2010/01/xml-namespaces.html

[00:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: any news on xml-stylesheet checking?

[00:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: "^text/xsl(;.*)?$" could be "^text/xsl(;|$)" instead, i think

[00:52:00.0000] <jtbandes>
Just a tip, with the disclaimer that I know nothing about the context here: isn't it better to use \A \Z rather than ^$ ?

[00:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
dunno

[00:54:01.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: &&amp; should be invalid

[01:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: will be soon

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[01:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: thanks

[01:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
jtbandes: what's \A \Z ?

[01:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: about news, you mean news about getting it deployed on validator.nu?

[01:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: naw i wondered if you've done anything more

[01:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: I think I've got it passing all test cases, and have implemented all the warnings cases

[01:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I sent the diff to hsivonen for review

[01:36:02.0000] <zcorpan>
cool

[01:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it's a pretty big diff, so I reckon it will take him some time to review it

[01:37:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i made a few more comments in the bug

[01:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah, OK

[01:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll make the chararacter-ref changes

[01:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and push out to qa-dev when I have it done

[01:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
James Clark's latest blog entry is a good read

[01:40:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
on namespaces

[01:40:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
he mentions the whatwg wiki mechanism for rel values

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
a mechanism which mark is planning on making orders of magnitude more complicated

[01:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, where is James Clark's blog?

[01:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
found it. http://blog.jclark.com/

[01:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yep

[01:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://blog.jclark.com/2010/01/xml-namespaces.html

[01:43:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
is the direct link to the post

[01:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
he also favors dotted/reverse DNS syntax for names

[01:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's interesting how in step 2 he claims that "The one true way of naming things on the Web is with a URI." and then step 3 identifies the problem with that, but instead of fixing the problem in step 2, a layer of abstraction is added instead.

[01:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy: I don't think he's claiming that. I think instead he's just saying that statement seems reasonable to many people

[01:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, good, he says "But this is where I believe XML Namespaces went wrong."

[01:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, a good deal of the rest of blog post is really about saying that it turns our #2 is not so reasonable

[01:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that there needs to be a distinction between how to name things, and how to name types of things

[01:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
imho #3 and #5 are equally wrong, and #6 in true but shouldn't be on the list given that namespaces as written doesn't address it properly (and the list is supposed to be "how namespaces ended up being as it is today")

[02:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://socialcomputing291.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/mini-project-on-html5with-css-and-javascript/ "it was fun to do it because HTML 5 is so easy to learn" is good; "I have tried to do the offline saving by using manifest functionality of HTML 5 but no luck." less so

[02:42:00.0000] <annevk>
weird that abarth would say "You're right, as you always are."

[06:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, ok. I'll look at those next week

[07:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmm, I can't push to html5lib

[07:35:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Just get auth failed.

[07:38:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, just copying and pasting password failed.

[07:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I've got something stuck on my clipboard. WTF?

[08:27:00.0000] <cardona507>
so localStorage is tied to my entire domain? meaning that if I have a page in directory A that has something stored in localStorage, that stuff will show up in directory B's localStorage? That is what appears to be happening to me. If so, how would we host multiple apps on a domain without them polluting each other?

[08:31:00.0000] <annevk>
use a prefix

[08:38:00.0000] <cardona507>
thanks annevk - what do you mean? 

[08:40:00.0000] <cardona507>
like www2.foo.com?

[08:40:01.0000] <cardona507>
or foo.bar.com?

[08:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
cardona507: Use a prefix in the keys that you use when accessing localStorage

[08:45:01.0000] <cardona507>
thank Philip` - And happy new year everyone

[08:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
localStorage.a_whatever = 1; localStorage.b_whatever = 2; // no conflicts

[08:46:00.0000] <cardona507>
nice to know

[09:18:00.0000] <foolip>
gsnedders: I was going to ask if python html5lib is decent enough if I want to parse a file, modify the DOM a bit and then pretty-print the result

[09:19:00.0000] <foolip>
obviously yes to step one and two, but the last?

[09:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: It has an HTML5 serializer, which should do what you want

[09:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
and it has various configuration options depending on what you consider pretty

[09:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
(though it never does anything DOM-altering like inserting whitespace to make the output prettier)

[09:44:00.0000] <foolip>
hmm, guess I'll have to try then

[09:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
The multipage spec splitter uses html5lib to parser and modify and print pages, which sounds like what you want

[09:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/parser/parse/

[09:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, actually it uses lxml to parse because html5lib is painfully slow)

[09:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
(http://code.google.com/p/html5/source/browse/trunk/spec-splitter/spec-splitter.py)

[09:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(But that has occasionally caused Hixie grief, but seeming it makes stuff so much quicker he's perfectly willing to use lxml to parse)

[10:23:00.0000] <foolip>
gsnedders: do you have any pretty-priting experience, given that you generate specs in your free time?

[10:23:01.0000] <foolip>
i.e. does there exist a finished library that is HTML-nostic and knows where it is safe to insert whitespace and not, etc

[10:25:00.0000] <foolip>
in other news, transforming between different mapping coordinate systems requires a lot of math :/

[10:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Hixie doesn't have a choice of parser with the spec-splitter

[10:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
since (as far as I'm aware) it's running on my server and I've configured it to use one that doesn't steal all my CPUs

[10:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
foolip: Basically the only spec I generate in my spare time is HTML5 in testing Anolis :)

[10:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
foolip: and I really don't care about what the output looks like

[10:39:02.0000] <foolip>
ok

[10:39:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: He could nag you

[10:39:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: He seems to be quite good at that

[10:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I could ignore him

[10:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I think I'm quite good at that

[10:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: For transforming between different mapping coordinate systems, why not use a GIS library that implements it all already? :-)

[11:02:00.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: that's plan A, but the math is kind of fun to look into

[11:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me had fun using PostgreSQL/PostGIS, since he could simply store latitude/longitude in the database and create an index over the transformation into a square grid system

[11:07:00.0000] <foolip>
/me is trying to help dad convert the swedish RT90 system into something that is useable with google maps

[11:31:00.0000] <cardona507>
if I want to see the coords that are returned from getCurrentPosition() in my console, can I? I tried navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition().position.coords.latitude; - is it possible?

[14:21:00.0000] <payman`>
gsnedders: ping

[14:28:00.0000] <foolip>
hey payman`, are you back in lkpg?

[14:37:00.0000] <payman`>
foolip: no, still in Wien :D

[14:39:00.0000] <foolip>
having a good time?

[14:39:01.0000] <foolip>
when are you back?

[14:40:00.0000] <payman`>
yes, everything is cool! :) i will be back on jan 5th

[14:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
payman`: pong

[14:42:00.0000] <payman`>
gsnedders: backpong!

[16:06:00.0000] <brandon>
I am guessing this is several days late, but I ran into a limitation I wasn't expecting (assumed it was in the spec). The problem I am having is placing a background of rgba(0,0,0,.2) OVER a background image... but background colors are only allowed to be declared last (after all other images)... The only other solution (without adding more markup or changing the image itself) is to set a...

[16:06:01.0000] <brandon>
...transparency to the background (with a background color of black)... Is there any way of getting something similar into the spec? Or is there something I'm missing?

[16:50:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Anyone?

[16:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
bfrohs, yeah, be with you in a minute...

[16:53:01.0000] <bfrohs>
Thanks.

[16:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
bfrohs, try using the ::before pseudo-element, which you can style and position on top of the element with the background image.

[16:57:01.0000] <bfrohs>
Very good idea, thanks. I'll let you know how it works out.

[16:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
here's a quick demo http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/338

[17:01:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Doesn't work with content inside the tag

[17:01:01.0000] <bfrohs>
Pushes it down - also doesn't work with liquid element

[17:02:00.0000] <bfrohs>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Cstyle%3E%0Adiv%20{%20height%3A%2099px%3B%20width%3A%20200px%3B%20background%3A%20url%28image%29%20}%0Adiv%3A%3Abefore%20{%20display%3A%20block%3B%20height%3A%2099px%3B%20width%3A%20200px%3B%20background%3A%20rgba%280%2C0%2C255%2C.5%29%3B%20content%3A%20%22%22%20}%0A%3C%2Fstyle%3E%0A%3Cdiv%3Ehai%3C%2Fdiv%3E

[17:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
bfrohs, set position: absolute; on the ::before

[17:09:00.0000] <bfrohs>
I already did that, but it doesn't account for the fact that it doesn't work with liquid content

[17:09:01.0000] <bfrohs>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/339

[17:10:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Well, hold on.

[17:10:01.0000] <bfrohs>
Yeah, even with Overflow:hidden, it doesn't work

[17:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
bfrohs, set position: relative; on the div, so that the absolute positioning on the ::before is contained within it

[17:16:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Setting position to relative hides the :before completely (with 100% width and height to account for fluid elements)

[17:17:00.0000] <bfrohs>
And it also pushes the content down when any other height is set (5em for example)

[17:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
huh?

[17:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
seems to work for me. But I'm not sure what exactly you're doing

[17:23:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Could you send me your file?

[17:24:00.0000] <bfrohs>
I may have just mistyped something.

[17:27:00.0000] <bfrohs>
You're a life saver! Thanks!

[17:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"A  PublicIdentifier SHOULD NOT be used unless the content is being managed in a controlled environment where the intended version is known"

[17:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't it sort of redundant to specify the version in the doctype if one of the premises is that the version is already known?

[17:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
bfrohs, be sure to use :before with one colon instead of two, if you want it to work in IE. Though, I'm not sure what other issues might crop up with it since I haven't tested it at all with what I did

[17:31:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Yeah, always do. And I'll be sure to test it, thanks Lachy.

[17:36:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Lachy, I've run into a problem with it. It applies the background (of the :before) on top of the text as well (hence why I'm using rgba vs opacity)

[17:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, then I think the only solution would be to use 2 elements. One with the background image and the other on top with the background colour and text

[17:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
or, maybe not. one sec...

[17:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
bfrohs, set z-index: -1; and specify the background image on on ::before, and then specify the colour on the element. That will give you the correct layering of text, bg colour, bg image

[17:55:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Doesn't work either. Only works if there isn't a parent with a declared background

[17:56:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Thanks though Lachy! I'll get ahold of the CSS wg

[18:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
bfrohs: It should still work, you'll just need to be more careful and explicit about z-ordering.

[18:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Your problem is that the parent with the declared background is layering on top of the ::before

[18:27:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Yes, I know, but it's not just a signle element (nor a fixed size). It's built into a web application (programmed myself) that would have several elements (all at different depths in the DOM) with this class.

[18:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
bfrohs: Ah, then you're in trouble.  Obvious (though annoying) hack around this: a 1px partially-transparent image.

[22:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: the ABNF for the text content of the style element doesn't seem to allow <style><!--></style>

[22:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but back in the "escaping text span" days, that was conformant

[22:09:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
is it intentional that it should be non-conformant now?

[22:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's non-conforming according to CSS anyway

[22:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[22:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
but off-hand i don't know if zcorpan (or hsivonen? i forget who came up with what the rules should be) wanted that to conform or not

[22:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see a use case for having it conforming though, so...

[22:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, I'll ask them later if they have any cases

[22:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
was asking because I'm attempting right now to write a mechanism for validator.nu to check style contents, based on that ABNF

[22:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if that were to be conforming, it'd mean adding an additional state

[22:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: btw, why "c-start" and "c-end" ?

[22:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
what's the "c" for?

[22:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks at what c-start is

[22:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
comment-start

[22:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[22:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, it's not a comment...

[22:14:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's more of an escape

[22:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's just an opaque string really

[22:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
the only thing in that ABNF that matters is "style"

[22:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
everything else is a spec implementation detail

[22:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
could be "a", "b", "c", etc

[22:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I know.. was asking because I wanted to have state names that are less opaque

[22:17:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I'm using ESCAPE

[23:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
mjs: "We follow a similar process for Safari, except that we don't usually test if a site works in Chrome first, since that rarely comes up"

[23:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
ooh, burn :-)

[23:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: is "<style><!-- </style --></style>" meant to be conformant?

[23:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[23:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
the only requirement is that each <!-- be followed by a --> before the end and before another <!--

[23:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[23:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
no even that's wrong

[23:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
the only requirement is that each <!-- be followed by a --> before the end

[23:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[23:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
(ignoring <!--s between a <!-- and a -->)

[23:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's hard to say in english

[23:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
hence the ABNF :-)

[23:32:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[23:32:06.0000] <Hixie>
<style> is the one with the wacky  rules

[23:32:07.0000] <Hixie>
er

[23:32:08.0000] <Hixie>
<script>

[23:32:09.0000] <Hixie>
i'm still on vacation. my brain will be turned on on monday. :_)

[23:32:10.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[23:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
good luck with implementing 4.3.1.2 and 4.3.1.3 at the same time btw

[23:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
well, I wonder if hsivonen might need to make change to his HTML parser

[23:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
(i.e. i hope you're doing it from code and not some schema language that only accepts one abnf per element)

[23:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: doing it from a normal state machine

[23:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
well for <script> in certain cases you have to check it against two grammars

[23:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
and i ain't merging them

[23:34:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh, OK :)

[23:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
i had enough trouble writing them as it is :-P

[23:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will leave <script> for after <style>

[23:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think the reason i didn't call c-start "escape" is because i did the script one first and it already has an "escape", btw

[23:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
and a "comment"

[23:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
and i was trying to keep them vaguely off each other's toes

[23:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok, np .. I can see that for the spec it's not a problem for it to just be opaque

[23:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
had been just trying to decide on something meaningful to put in the code

[23:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so, seems like hsivonen parser gets to "<style><!-- </style " and switches to before-attribute-name state

[23:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or before that gets to tag-name state, I guess

[23:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I'll ask him about it when he gets back

[23:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i didn't think of that

[23:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes, that sounds right

[23:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
sorry i was thinking about it from a DOM point of view

[23:40:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[23:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
and assuming that you meant a "style" element with "<!-- </style -->" as its only text node child

[23:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
the literal markup, even assuming it had a DOCTYPE and all, wouldn't be valid because "--" isn't a valid attribute and there's an unexpected </style>

[23:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[23:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so the current parser behavior is right?

[23:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
it sounds right but what do i know

[23:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
i only work here

[23:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[23:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
ask me again in a few days if you want a more coherent answer :-)

[23:43:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok, sure

[23:43:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, fwiw, what I have for <style> checking is live on http://qa-dev.w3.org:8888/

[23:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[23:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: btw, take a look at http://qa-dev.w3.org:8888/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fdev.w3.org%2Fhtml5%2Ftests%2Fvalidation%2Ffull%2Finvalid%2Fmissing-attributes%2Flink-missing-href.html&showsource=yes

[23:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
ooh, much nicer

[23:45:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, that one took some work

[23:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i hope henri hides notes #1 and #2 from the default UI at some point

[23:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess those don't bother me since I've just habituated to reading past them

[23:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I can see that for new users they might be not optimal

[23:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
well at some point i assume this will get some more serious UI review and testing... but that can wait until the backend is solid :-)

[23:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
i hope we get some competition for henri

[23:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, but he has set the bar pretty high

[23:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
this luvvy-duvvy w3c working with henri thing is ruining the plan for making validation into a tool rather than an authority

[23:48:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[23:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, about that required-attributes reporting, whether it actually gets deployed will depend on if hsivonen thinks how I implemented it is sane

[23:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[23:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
bbiab, dinner

[23:49:03.0000] <jtbandes>
What language is used to implement the validator?

[23:49:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
ttyl

[23:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jtbandes: a couple different things

[23:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but basically Java

[23:50:02.0000] <jtbandes>
obligatory: ew java :P

[23:50:03.0000] <jtbandes>
Why java?

[23:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
for one thing, because the validator architecture is based on SAX, and Java has solid SAX support

[23:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and for another thing, because of the abundance of useful libraries in Java

[23:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but those are just my understanding

[23:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you want the real details, ask hsivonen 

[23:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
jtbandes: or read his thesis

[23:52:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to find URL for hsivonen thesis

[23:52:04.0000] <jtbandes>
Hm

[23:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/thesis/html5-conformance-checker.xhtml

[23:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
jtbandes: platform portability was another concern, I think

[00:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: (when you get back) as far as 4.3.1.2 and 4.3.1.3, I think from the pov of the v.nu backend, those can be implemented as two different checkers (separate classes) .. so hopefully no need code-wise to merge handling of those

[00:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me steps out for a bit

[01:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jtbandes: see 3rd question under http://about.validator.nu/#faq

[01:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, <style><!--> opens an escape in opera, so i don't mind it being invalid :)

[01:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I imagine it's only because Chrome hasn't been around long enough yet for sites to depend on its quirks - I expect it may start happening at some point

[01:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i wasn't disagreeing with you :-)

[01:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
whatwg spec has dropped in google results for "html5"

[01:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
probably due to the title change

[02:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: what's the difference between a personal opinion of a chair and an official opinion of a chair? i'm confused.

[02:32:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe he thought you meant the position of the chairs

[02:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
?

[02:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
as opposed to what?

[02:32:03.0000] <annevk>
his position

[02:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to use a particularly flame-baiting analogy, the pope does not always speak ex cathedra

[02:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in other words, I stand by my opinion, but I haven't even asked my co-chairs about it, let alone gotten their sign-off, so it's a little dicey to call it "guidance from the chairs"

[02:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
dude if every time i ask you a question you need to get two other people to sign off on it, our conversations aren't going to be very quick.

[02:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
definitely not required every time

[02:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but I need space for posting purely personal opinions

[02:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
otherwise I'll either end up posting much less, or make people mad for making improper official statements

[02:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in this case, no one asked me a question at all, I just provided my opinion unasked

[02:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
man i miss the days where we didn't have to worry about having personal opinions vs official opinions vs charters and so forth and we could just worry about what we thought the right thing for the web was

[02:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in this case I wouldn't have worried about the difference if you hadn't cited what I meant to be "Maciej's opinion" as "guidance from the chairs"

[02:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that being said, I realize I took on that sort of hazard when I agreed to accept a political position

[02:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
i hadn't realised there was a difference, i assumed when one of the chairs gave guidance, it was guidance from the chairs :-)

[02:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that's like saying every time Joe Lieberman gives a speech, that's guidance from the US Senate

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
which it is

[02:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
seems more correct to refer to guidance from Maciej or guidance from Joe Lieberman

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
certainly more precise, dunno about more correct

[02:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what I say here isn't guidance from Mozilla

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the difference?

[02:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there are times when what I say is on behalf of some group or organization of which I am a member, but it certainly can't be on behalf of all of them every time

[02:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess the difference is that i don't see input from a company or from a random person as being any different, but i see the chairs as having authority

[02:50:00.0000] <nessy>
so are all your opinions opinions of Google?

[02:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
google's employees have many opinions, all of which are often aired in public

[02:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
s/'s//

[02:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
indeed, the chairs have authority, and many times when I speak I do not intend to wield the authority of the chairs

[02:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: but certainly google managers assume that everything we say reflects on google, i don't get to say "oh well i didn't mean that as a google employee"

[02:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
whether it is realistic to expect that is another matter

[02:54:00.0000] <annevk>
I don't get Larry's real world... If it's his real world, surely he'd know the answer?

[02:54:01.0000] <nessy>
just being facetious - I we're all in the same position with the companies that we represent :-)

[02:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
nessy: yes, that's why i was surprised by maciej's e-mail

[02:55:01.0000] <nessy>
/me goes checking out email

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i guess i still think that there's a difference between a random person describing their opinions, and a chair describing their opinion, and i would consider the latter guidance regardless of whether it was a proclamation of chair consensus or not

[02:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: fair enough, and if you said "guidance from one of the chairs", I would not complain

[02:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: because in the absence of more data, all we have so far is a bunch of people arguing about what the group should do, and one chair saying what their opinion is

[02:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: and at the ond of that day, the chairs get to decide

[02:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(unless I tried to draw some clear distinction that I'm speaking in some other role, such as representing Apple)

[02:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough

[02:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's sad that we can't necessarily assume that our chairs are of one mind on matters as key as what the target audience of the main wg deliverable is, though :-)

[02:59:00.0000] <nessy>
maybe they are, but maciej is just careful?

[03:00:00.0000] <nessy>
I find that thread weird anyway … but that's just me :)

[03:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I've never actually asked them because it hasn't often been a relevant point of debate

[03:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Larry is trying to establish some basic points that would support his argument that HTML5 should have an optional version indicator

[03:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I doubt he'll get everyone to agree, but it beats his original approach of not stating a rationale at all

[06:16:00.0000] <Huvet>
hi, did someone remove the documentation? http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/wiki/UserDocumentation

[06:16:01.0000] <Huvet>
linked from the startpage

[06:27:00.0000] <Huvet>
or, I could ask what I wanted to know instead :)

[06:28:00.0000] <Huvet>
how do I strip all HTML from a page with html5lib?

[06:28:01.0000] <Huvet>
(python version)

[06:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Different question: whitespace collapse is just a display effect, right?  The original whitespace is still present in the DOM?

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
TabAtkins: it's in the DOM

[06:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
TabAtkins: however, CRLF normalization takes place before the DOM

[06:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
hsivonen: Excellent.

[06:53:00.0000] <cardona507>
hey TabAtkins - how are you doing? Did you have a nice holiday? Did you ever post the CSS3 presentation from TPAC? I still haven't seen it.

[06:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yo, cardona507.  I finished it up and sent it off to TBL.  He put up an early cut without the slides, but I haven't heard anything about it since then either.

[06:56:02.0000] <mikekelly>
hi fans

[06:58:00.0000] <mikekelly>
been trying to figure out why there's no @rel attribute for form elements

[06:59:00.0000] <mikekelly>
anyone got any idea why that might be the case?

[06:59:01.0000] <cardona507>
what exactly is HTML5lib?

[07:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
cardona507: Is that a deep philosopical question or do you want a simple answer like "a set of implementations of the html5 parsing algorithm for various languages (principally python, also PHP, formerly ruby), and some associated utilities for working with HTML trees"

[07:03:00.0000] <cardona507>
jgraham - :) - not it isn't a philiosophical question - I actually am interested in what it is - thanks for the answer

[07:03:01.0000] <mikekelly>
is a form not considered a type of hyperlink?

[07:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
mikekelly: No - <a href> and <area href> and some <link href>s are the only hyperlinks

[07:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#hyperlink-elements

[07:08:00.0000] <mikekelly>
Philip`: Ok - I was wondering more about the reason that distinction is held

[07:09:00.0000] <mikekelly>
i.e. a form links the UA to another URL .. seems like a hyperlink to me

[07:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd guess it's because those are the only things that directly provide a URL for users to visit

[07:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
whereas form URLs aren't useful by themselves, since they require form data to be passed too

[07:10:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and lots of other URL attributes (<img src> etc) aren't followed by users)

[07:11:00.0000] <mikekelly>
so rel='search-result' wouldn't be an appropriate link relation for the google search box?

[07:11:01.0000] <mikekelly>
the link is variable

[07:11:02.0000] <mikekelly>
but it's constrained

[07:11:03.0000] <Philip`>
How would any consumer make use of that rel information?

[07:12:00.0000] <mikekelly>
the variable parts of a GET action are all search parts

[07:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
If the search form had rel="next" then what should happen in a UA which provides a 'next page' button in its UI based on rel=next links?

[07:12:02.0000] <mikekelly>
Philip`: a machine would be able to insert data into that form and understand the semantics of the resulting requesdt

[07:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
That wouldn't work on e.g. Google's search box because the semantics of the response depend on the parameters, e.g. if you click "I'm Feeling Lucky" then it sends different parameters and the result is a redirection to a result page instead of a list of results

[07:15:00.0000] <mikekelly>
what is the difference between those two submit buttons?

[07:15:01.0000] <mikekelly>
is that html?

[07:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
<form action=...><input type=submit name=btnG value=Search><input type=submit name=btnI value=Lucky></form>

[07:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh dear

[07:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
If I click "I'm Feeling Lucky" with no text in the search box, it looks like an old Geocities page with fireworks everywhere :-(

[07:19:00.0000] <mikekelly>
er.. right

[07:19:01.0000] <mikekelly>
and that would be perfectly valid HTTP response

[07:19:02.0000] <mikekelly>
the redirect is a 'search-result'

[07:19:03.0000] <mikekelly>
a search result that redirects you..

[07:19:04.0000] <cardona507>
:-/ oh my - those google fireworks are nice

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
They're terribly slow in Opera

[07:20:01.0000] <mikekelly>
Philip`: I don't see any problem with that at all.

[07:20:02.0000] <mikekelly>
infact, there is no problem with that at all

[07:20:03.0000] <daedb>
what fireworks?

[07:20:04.0000] <mikekelly>
take the URL that feeling luckky button generates

[07:20:05.0000] <mikekelly>
and put it in CURL

[07:20:06.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, they're much faster in Opera 10.50

[07:20:07.0000] <cardona507>
daedb - go to google and click i'm feeling lucky

[07:21:00.0000] <mikekelly>
and see what you get

[07:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray for faster Opera

[07:21:02.0000] <cardona507>
+1 to that!

[07:21:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me eagerly awaits one that's fast and also stable

[07:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
mikekelly: Do you think the rel should be a per-form thing, or a per-submit-button thing?

[07:23:00.0000] <mikekelly>
Philip`: per form..

[07:23:01.0000] <mikekelly>
the 'problem' you've identified doesn't exist

[07:24:00.0000] <daedb>
cardona507: I just get a page that explains the I'm feeling lucky function, no fireworks.

[07:24:01.0000] <cardona507>
daedb - I am logged in to my google account also - I don't know if that affects it - Philip`, are you logged in to your google account when you see the fireworks?

[07:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
mikekelly: It seems like a problem if the buttons do more differing things, or if you want to assign more specific semantics to the form, which don't seem like uncommon situations

[07:25:01.0000] <mikekelly>
Philip`: when you click I'm feeling Lucky - it's still making the resulting request to a search-result on google server

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
mikekelly: (The specific case of search forms can be handled by <input type=search> anyway, so I'm assuming you want something more general)

[07:26:01.0000] <mikekelly>
so what can you actually change with an html form button?

[07:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
cardona507: I am both logged in and not logged in

[07:26:03.0000] <mikekelly>
all you can do is add another parameter to the search part of a URI

[07:26:04.0000] <daedb>
cardona507: I logged in... doesn't seem to make a difference

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me goes away for a bit

[07:27:01.0000] <mikekelly>
Philip`: yeah something more general.. almost like.. a platform for development :)

[07:27:02.0000] <mikekelly>
*shock horror*

[07:27:03.0000] <daedb>
/me wants to see the fireworks too :(

[07:30:00.0000] <cardona507>
daedb - http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/7306/googlenewyear.png - enjoy :)

[07:30:01.0000] <cardona507>
just imagine that animated across the screen over and over 

[07:30:02.0000] <mikekelly>
Philip`: I guess you could add in a more specific link relation for specific buttons..

[07:32:00.0000] <Huvet>
any clue about my question? how do I remove all HTML with html5lib?

[07:32:01.0000] <Huvet>
and second question, where did the documentation go? 

[07:33:00.0000] <daedb>
oh, now I got it to work... had to click the "Google in english" link (but switching language in prefs did nothing) for it to work.

[07:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Huvet: I'd guess it might be something like

[07:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
  from lxml import etree

[07:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
  parser = html5lib.html5parser.HTMLParser(tree = html5lib.treebuilders.getTreeBuilder('lxml'))

[07:35:03.0000] <Philip`>
  doc = parser.parse(open(filename), encoding='utf-8')

[07:35:04.0000] <cardona507>
so google isn't showing those nice effects to our multilingual brothers and sisters - such a shame :)

[07:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
(untested)

[07:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
  text = etree.tostring(doc, method='text')

[07:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
Huvet: and then escape all the "<"s and "&"s if you're going to display it in an HTML page

[07:36:03.0000] <Huvet>
ah, I'll try that, thanks

[07:36:04.0000] <Huvet>
I don't want any HTML at all

[07:36:05.0000] <Huvet>
just remove all the tags

[07:37:00.0000] <Huvet>
I just want to show the raw text content from a HTML page

[07:38:00.0000] <Huvet>
 I guess you could mean that I still have to replace all < chars? Even though all HTML is removed?

[07:38:01.0000] <daedb>
cardona507: Maybe Google is just anti-Sweden, they're scared of our awesomeness :D

[07:38:02.0000] <cardona507>
:)

[07:39:00.0000] <Huvet>
<- fellow swede :)

[07:39:01.0000] <cardona507>
/me is feeling overwhelmed with awesomeness

[07:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
Huvet: Yeah, if the input is like "&lt;<b>foo&gt;" it should return "<foo>" etc - it's just extracting the text from the parsed document

[10:33:00.0000] <jwalden>
I'm sure I've read something about the preferred DOM for a block quote with an embedded authority (like "All the world's a stage<NL>-Shakespeare"), but I don't see any examples of it in the HTML5 spec for <blockquote> -- could anyone point me at what's the proper way?

[10:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"Content inside a blockquote must be quoted from another source" says the spec

[10:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so presumably <blockquote>All the world's a stage</blockquote><p>-Shakespeare</p>

[10:39:00.0000] <jwalden>
that would seem to treat -Shakespeare as semantically at the same level with any surrounding paragraphs of information, which doesn't seem right

[10:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen would probably do something like <blockquote>"All the world's a stage" -Shakespeare</blockquote>

[10:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use cite and point it at Shakespeare's FOAF file URI

[10:46:01.0000] <jwalden>
I was thinking of maybe doing <blockquote><p>All the world's a stage</p><p class="attribution">Shakespeare</p></blockquote> with some styling to right-align, "-"-prefix, etc.

[10:46:02.0000] <zcorpan>
anyone found any bugs with opera's <video> impl yet?

[10:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
why use css to "-"-prefix?

[10:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_You_Like_It">All the world's a stage<br>And all the men and women are merely players;<br>They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>His acts being seven ages....</blockquote>

[10:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Surely you mean "–"-prefix.\

[10:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
s/\\//

[10:48:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Then the browser can add the citation magically! :P

[10:48:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me checks, and to his amazement actually quoted it correctly

[10:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
AryehGregor: ?

[10:49:01.0000] <jwalden>
en dash versus hyphen

[10:49:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders why he can't type non-ASCII characters from this computer into irssi.

[10:49:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, an em dash might be best.

[10:49:04.0000] <gsnedders>
em dash, surely?

[10:49:05.0000] <gsnedders>
An en dash for that would be completely inappropriate

[10:50:00.0000] <jwalden>
wikipedia's dash article, strangely, doesn't suggest a "correct" dash there as far as I could tell

[10:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: That doesn't look right to me - surely you need a <br> before "And one"

[10:50:02.0000] <jwalden>
\2015 is the "quotation dash", but it's apparently used to *introduce* quotes, not to terminate them, from what I could tell

[10:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't tell the difference between en and em dashes in this monospace font

[10:50:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Ah, woops

[10:50:05.0000] <jwalden>
I had to /eval a copy-paste to determine code points :-)

[10:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jwalden: Yeah, it controls the spacing for it, as well as giving a slightly longer length than a em dash, IIRC

[10:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Even I know that Shakespeare used narrow columns :-p

[10:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(the spacing is the most obviously different point to the em dash)

[10:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Also, s/women are merely/women merely/ apparently

[10:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: You can't just get it wrong and then say you got it correct :-p

[10:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, definitely needed, otherwise it breaks from meter

[10:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh well, <q>The course of true love never did run smooth</q>.

[10:54:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hides

[10:54:02.0000] <jwalden>
http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html/bq.html is suggesting <bq/><div class>, abbreviating a bit

[10:54:03.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[10:54:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Not <bq>!

[10:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
bq is just _so_ HTML 3.

[10:55:01.0000] <zcorpan>
opera supports bq... i mean supported

[10:55:02.0000] <jwalden>
wait...was there actually a bq element?  I was just avoiding the typing!

[10:55:03.0000] <gsnedders>
In HTML 3

[10:55:04.0000] <jwalden>
whaaa...

[10:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: We still support it in the latest stable release, with our buggy implementation of HTMLQuoteElement!

[10:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(the only special attribute on HTMLQuoteElement over HTMLElement is cite, which should return an absolute URL, but returns the attribute value in O10.10 for blockquote and bq)

[10:56:02.0000] <zcorpan>
who cares about the latest stable release

zcorpan: Me, as I had nothing to do with it, so any bugs in it aren't my fault, ever.

[11:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan: Users? :-)

[11:01:01.0000] <Huvet>
Philip`: the html stripping code you proposed crashes on unicode characters I'm afraid

[11:01:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Philip`: yeah

[11:01:03.0000] <Huvet>
somewhere inside lxml.etree

[11:02:00.0000] <Huvet>
oh, hi zcorpan :)

[11:02:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hi Huvet

etree.tostring(Element, encoding=unicode, method='text', with_tail=False)

[11:03:01.0000] <Huvet>
thx

[11:04:00.0000] <jwalden>
aargh, <bq> plus <credit> in HTML3 are exactly the solution I desire for this; if only they'd been kept in later versions...

[11:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: found any blog software with a serializer yet?

[11:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: no

[11:05:02.0000] <zcorpan>
jwalden: we could add <credit> to html5--i mean html6

[11:05:03.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: s/6//

[11:05:04.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[11:06:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me wonders if there was a whatwg@ thread about it that he didn't read, probably given how many threads there have been on everything under the sun

[11:06:01.0000] <zcorpan>
html > html5

[11:06:02.0000] <jwalden>
I would be astounded if no one had ever mentioned it

[11:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hence,

[11:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Why, you found any decent blog software?

[11:08:01.0000] <zcorpan>
no

[11:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me really wants something sane for thereshouldbenored.com

i'd like something for spacergif.mobi

[11:12:02.0000] <Huvet>
heh, that has got to be one of the worse domain names ever :)

[11:13:00.0000] <Huvet>
worst*

[11:13:01.0000] <Huvet>
I like it!

[11:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Hey, I at least have something at spacergif.mobi

[11:15:01.0000] <jwalden>
/me waits for the IF TLD so he can steal spacerg.if

[11:15:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me still wants photos from the toilet there

[11:15:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(to make a joke very few will get)

[11:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: what do you have at spacergif.mobi?

[11:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: i have it on my phone

[11:16:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, it's a gif

[11:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
You could have something I could _see_!

[11:17:01.0000] <zcorpan>
you aint supposed to see spacer gifs

[11:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But there's no red, so I guess it passes.

[11:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jwalden: I'd never seen it green until a colleague sat around for a while reloading it.

[11:18:02.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: What resolution?

[11:19:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: blank is usually not a pass

[11:19:01.0000] <jwalden>
gsnedders: you still at opera, or back at school yet?

[11:19:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jwalden: At Opera

[11:19:03.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: probably 640x480 or less

[11:19:04.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Or more to the point: can you read the sign?

[11:19:05.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[11:19:06.0000] <gsnedders>
And see red?

[11:19:07.0000] <jwalden>
nice, must have been longer than the three-month periods I'm used to in the US

[11:19:08.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[11:20:00.0000] <jwalden>
unless my sense of time is just shot

[11:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jwalden: Oh, I ended up staying on after internship for a gap year

[11:20:02.0000] <jwalden>
ah

[11:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But some people don't want me to leave at the end of my gap year

[11:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:P

[11:22:02.0000] <jwalden>
heh

[11:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
(And I don't mean my father ;P)

[11:23:01.0000] <jwalden>
this is before college (I think), so I wouldn't recommend it, since I doubt you're planning to go to some sort of vocational/technical school

[11:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But education means exams, and exams suck. :P

[11:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Tell me about it, I have my writtens in three days.  >:(

[11:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: it's 1200x1600 apparently

[11:26:01.0000] <jwalden>
I can take exams as an acceptable cost to pay for gaining the knowledge, mostly :-)

[11:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: email it to me (me⊙gc)

[11:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder if i can email files with opera mini

[11:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm the <input type=file> control does nothing

[11:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jwalden, the knowledge or the degree?  You could always study by yourself and skip the exam bit if not for the "grades" part.

[11:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like just audit every course.

[11:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unless you can't bring yourself to study without exams.

[11:39:00.0000] <jwalden>
I'm not convinced you can learn as much just by self-study; doing it with others, struggling through it with them, is significant additional value

[11:40:00.0000] <Huvet>
gsnedders: thanks for that encoding attrib, works great :)

[11:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Huvet: That's literally what Anolis uses, so it should work

[11:41:00.0000] <Huvet>
/me googles Anolis

[11:41:01.0000] <Huvet>
ah, nice

[11:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
jwalden, you could go to college but just audit all your courses, and not take the tests.  The only reason to actually take courses is if you want the degree.

[11:42:00.0000] <jwalden>
a degree's certainly a useful signaling mechanism

[11:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right, that's the key thing.  You don't need exams to learn things, you need exams to prove to others that you've learned things.

[11:42:02.0000] <Huvet>
yeah, and don't forget the networking possibilities... lots of people get a job through their uni. network

[11:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>

[20:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hum

[20:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"IO Error: Resource size exceeds limit" for http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fdev.w3.org%2Fhtml5%2Fspec%2FOverview.html

[20:49:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I was trying to check if the w3c version of the spec is real html4, or just html5 with a html4 doctype

[21:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Dashiva: please try on http://qa-dev.w3.org:8888/

[21:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I upped the limit there

[21:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
the upstream limit at validator.nu is 4096KB

[21:12:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and the spec is around 4300KB or so now

[23:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if the spec is going to grow like gmail storage space

[23:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
the sum of specs that define the web will, certainly

[23:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
whether we have that in one document or a great many or something in between is an editorial issue

[23:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
well, looks like validator.nu needs to have its limit grown once in a while to accommodate the spec

[23:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it'll be interesting to see if at some point the limit grows larger than what would be appropriate to protect the VM from DoS

[23:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: welcome back

[23:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: thanks

[23:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I'll look at your patches in due course.

[23:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
no hurry

[23:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I got a couple more on the way

[23:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I don't mean to overload you, just took advantage of the holiday break to try to get a few things written up

[23:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: btw, do you know of any reason why <style><!--></style> should be conforming?

[23:23:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's not conforming in the current spec

[23:23:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
in the ABNF for the contents of the style element

[23:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the spec shouldn't have grown... it was working fine before the holidays for me, and i validate the complete version of the spec before preprocessing (i.e. about 13 specs at once)

[23:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe the preprocessor overhead is more than i realised

[23:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
it was hitting the v.nu size limit well before the holidays

[23:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: how does that parse in legacy browsers?

[23:25:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: a month or more ago

[23:25:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: not sure

[23:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: the post-processed version?

[23:25:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: maybe Simon knows

[23:25:06.0000] <Hixie>
or the version i validate with all the specs?

[23:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
and w3c or whatwg?

[23:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I reran the deployment script. let's see if the new limit of 5 MB takes effect or if I need to restart the validator manually

[23:26:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: the w3c one for sure

[23:26:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
but I thought the whatwg version also

[23:26:04.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: in any case, it seems to me that it's not important to make <style><!--></style> conforming

[23:26:05.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: post-processed?

[23:26:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK

[23:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: yesh

[23:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm very surprised that the processing overhead is so high that html5 alone is bigger than the source of all the specs together

[23:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I was asking mainly because it was conforming before -- the spec said something like, "An escaping text span start can share its "--" characters with its escaping text span end".

[23:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so was wondering if somebody has maybe requested that it be conforming for some reason

[23:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I haven't made any change in that area knowingly other than trying to implement the new tokenizer states as specced

[23:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I meant just that it was conforming in the spec, before Hixie switched to the specific ABNF definition for style content

[23:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I didn't mean to say that parser behavior had changed

[23:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: oh. I haven't looked at what the spec says about the conformance of style and script content now

[23:32:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, anyway, I was wondering about it because I wrote up a style-content checker (after bug from Simon)

[23:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
which is one of the other patches I still need to send you for review

[23:33:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and if that case were conforming, it would mean adding another state to the state machine that does the check

[23:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but anyway, for now, I just implemented it to spec

[23:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
if there were ever somebody who wanted "<!-->" to be conforming, I guess they'll need to re-review the spec and send a comment to Hixie

[23:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so the other patch I have ready is for this:

[23:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://qa-dev.w3.org:8888/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fdev.w3.org%2Fhtml5%2Ftests%2Fvalidation%2Ffull%2Finvalid%2Fmissing-attributes%2Flink-missing-href.html

[23:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: what's the mechanism for making that happen? 

[23:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: added all required-attributes to Assertions.java and have the build make copies of the meta.rnc, embed.rnc, media.rnc, and microdata.rnc files with the required attributes made optional in the schema

[23:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the copies are, e.g, meta-vnu.rnc

[23:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and are generated, so not in version control

[23:41:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[23:41:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
used only internally by vnu

[23:41:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
does that sound sane?

[23:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yes

[23:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(I really wish Jing could do this)

[23:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK

[23:43:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, I wish jing would do it too

[23:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but one case I can imagine it being hard for Jing itself to report usefully on is the data and type attributes on the object element

[23:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: do you know if MSV reports usefully for required-but-missing attributes cases?

[23:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I don't

[23:46:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I tried to check with relaxed earlier, but the site seems to be down

[23:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, vacation over

[23:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
so i'm supposed to get all these bugs done by sunday huh

[23:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: at least most of them are clear for straightforward fixing or wontfixing

[23:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the deal with the assignee change here: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8238 ?

[00:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: would be nice to get 'em done, yeah - how many are open right now?

[00:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: looks like an accident to me

[00:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
212, shouldn't be a problem. though a number of them are things i'd really rather not resolve without knowing how the microdata issue gets resolved.

[00:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's fine to pick out that subset and hold off, as long as you say so in the bugs (though I think we can have it resolved sometime in the coming week)

[00:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
btw looking at the source of <http://dev.w3.org/html5/status/issue-status.html> it seems we have resolved 6 HTML WG tracker issues since I started the status list

[00:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://damowmow.com/playground/htmlwg/chart.html looks good, indeed

[00:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
probably at least some of the upcoming batch of bugs will turn into issues

[01:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: remind me - if i've included the boilerplate once, should i do it again if i'm closing the bug for the same reason?

[01:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8096

[01:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: if someone reopened it?

[01:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
marked it NEEDSINFO, asked for data, someone reopened it with information i still don't understand

[01:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
when i ask for further clarification and mark it NEEDSINFO again, do i include the "rejected" boilerplate again?

[01:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think an explanation of why the new info is not helpful is sufficient, but it would be fine to also add the boilerplate

[01:18:01.0000] <workmad3>
ooh, I remember that one from mailing list discussions :)

[01:19:00.0000] <workmad3>
I quite liked the idea, up until the point someone made note of the fact it would be ****ing awful for backwards compatibility

[01:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[01:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, there was a long discussion here on that one.  It's completely crazy.  He wants to have different resources served under the same URL, distinguished by the client's Accept header, like mysite.com/ returning a feed if you send Accept: application/rss+xml and a web page if you send Accept: text/html, or something similarly lunatic.

[01:19:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me should probably be more polite in a publicly-logged channel, sorry to any readers who might have been offended

[01:20:00.0000] <workmad3>
:)

[01:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: well i asked him to describe the user problem he's trying to solve, hopefully that will lead to him demonstrating that he isn't crazy and you just misunderstood him :-)

[01:21:01.0000] <workmad3>
oh wait... I just confused this one with the (very similar) discussion about <base>

[01:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If I totally misunderstood him after like an hour-long IRC argument, good luck on that.

[01:23:00.0000] <workmad3>
I *think* I can see the rationale behind the idea... basically allowing you to link to RESTful sites by specifying the content type

[01:24:00.0000] <workmad3>
but I don't see the rationale behind doing it all through one <link> tag... that just seems overcomplicated. Just specify a couple of <link> tags with different content types and pointing to the same URL

[01:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The idea of returning an HTML page or an RSS feed from the same URL is crazy.

[01:24:02.0000] <workmad3>
couple that with the fact that multiple <link> tags already works and multiple type attributes on a <link> tag will break older browsers...

[01:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you want to link to them or use them differently in any user-visible way, then they're different resources.

[01:26:00.0000] <workmad3>
AryehGregor: both views have weight unfortunately... although I agree that if they are both of relevance to a user then they should be distinguished in a user-visible way

[01:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, content negotiation ends up not being very useful altogether, even when used for its intended purpose.  At least in general web development, maybe not in some other uses of HTTP.

[01:26:02.0000] <workmad3>
as opposed to it being hidden behind some web service call that is :)

[01:27:00.0000] <workmad3>
still, if the guy wants to do this, a mechanism already exists (multiple <link>s) and the way he is suggesting just overcomplicates things and breaks backwards compatibility

[01:29:00.0000] <workmad3>
and HTML on the 'human web' shouldn't need to get confused with support for RESTful web services

[01:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not sure how REST works, but does it care about <link> in HTML documents?

[01:30:01.0000] <workmad3>
the REST principles don't

[01:30:02.0000] <workmad3>
but a RESTful web service can be 'correct' to those principles and work like the guy is suggesting (so the rss feed and the html page are just 2 representations of the same resource)

[01:32:00.0000] <workmad3>
so it's not so much that they care about <link>s, more that multiple type's can be blugeoned into looking like REST support... if that makes sense and I'm not sounding as crazy as the original guy :)

[01:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sigh. the autobuffer thread just keeps growing

[02:00:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, not in my inbox

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk>
/me lets foolip deal with it :)

[02:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: maybe boolean attributes should be called something other than boolean

[02:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: since it seems people assume they take values true and false

[02:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
too late to change the language design pattern itself at this point, of course

[02:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and ARIA really doesn't help by failing to use the pre-existing design pattern

[02:21:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, why would a non-normative guide be taken to Last Call?

[02:21:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, typically they're published as W3C Note

[02:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: good point

[02:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: does the W3C ever publish non-normative references or "primer" type guides as REC instead of Note?

[02:29:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe they have actually

[02:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I found at least one example: http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-owl2-primer-20091027/

[02:30:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/

[02:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I also found many examples that are Notes

[02:31:00.0000] <annevk>
should've remembered that I guess

[02:31:01.0000] <annevk>
but I'm not sure why we'd bother with the additional hassle if it's not at all needed

[02:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure if the TAG overlooked this, or if they specifically want it to end up a non-normative REC instead of a Note

[02:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: file a bug

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I will after lunch. gotta go now

[02:38:00.0000] <annevk>
presence attributes

[02:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
flag attributes might be a better name

[02:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
it sucks that we have contenteditable, spellcheck and draggable=true/false, but inconsistently have autocomplete=on/off

[02:57:00.0000] <annevk>
spellcheck should have been on/off too

[02:58:00.0000] <annevk>
because it and autocomplete are about turning things off

[02:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
autocomplete=true would have been fine

[03:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
contenteditable and autocomplete were decided long before html5 was written

[03:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
so we were screwed either way

[03:00:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I know that

[03:00:03.0000] <annevk>
no

[03:00:04.0000] <annevk>
we could've done spellcheck as on/off

[03:00:05.0000] <annevk>
but we didn't

[03:00:06.0000] <Hixie>
and had 2 and 2?

[03:00:07.0000] <Hixie>
that

[03:00:08.0000] <Hixie>
is even worse

[03:00:09.0000] <Hixie>
imho

[03:00:10.0000] <annevk>
no, they have different purposes each

[03:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[03:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually by the time i added spellcheck it already had 2 implementations iirc

[03:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
contentEditable and draggable are phrased as adjectives but also have the purpose of turning on/off

[03:01:03.0000] <Lachy>
if we introduce a buffering attribute, would buffering=on/off or true/false be better? Or should we go with none/auto/full as foolip suggested?

[03:01:04.0000] <annevk>
I think you might actually be the first that positioned the whole thing as such

[03:01:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i originally wrote it as a draft on damowmow.com

[03:01:06.0000] <othermaciej>
I would suggest not using on/off or true/false as the values if it has more than 2 states (which it should)

[03:02:00.0000] <annevk>
I meant the distinction between the attributes, not spellcheck (though you did that too)

[03:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: last i looked at the thread it didn't seem that there was a strong use case for anything different than what the spec says now, but i have only skimmed so far

[03:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, draggable has 3 states and uses true and false, and omitted as the 3rd state

[03:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's all in my video bucket

[03:02:04.0000] <jgraham>
Wouldn't "missing attribute" do for the auto state?

[03:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me hasn't caught up[ on the thread yet

[03:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: that's true - I'm not sure there needs to be an explicit way to say the same as the omitted state

[03:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I will try to summarize the thread into a bug when it settles down

[03:04:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, if we keep the spec as is, then having autobuffer omitted must then mean no buffering. But that doesn't allow for browsers to provide sensible heuristic based approaches

[03:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what Lachy said - I think there needs to be a way to specifically hint "don't buffer" that's distinct from giving no hint at all

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's the use case for that?

[03:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
"authors really want to conserve bandwidth"

[03:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
the main use case mentioned on the list has been a blog that includes a video as part of one of the entires, but the author doesn't think all users will want to watch the video just because the article still happens to be on the front page

[03:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
wouldn't that be all authors who don't want buffering?

[03:06:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: ?

[03:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the distinction between the author who doesn't want buffering (and so doesn't set autobuffer) and the author who wants no buffering (and so sets nobuffer)?

[03:07:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
MikeSmithX: <style><!--> opens an escape in opera

[03:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: The author that doesn't set autobuffer may still get buffering if the browser so choses

[03:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
the difference is that the omitted attribute doesn't give a clear indication of author preference, and so browsers should be allowed to optimise for the best user experience

[03:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: authors who don't think about the issue likely won't include any particular attribute, thus the browser might choose to guess whether buffering would be good based on things like number of videos on the page, their prominence and relative size, etc

[03:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. If I'm on a high speed connection with no bandwidth limits, as I am here in Norway, then I wouldn't mind having my browser autobuffer for me automatically on most sites. However, if I'm stuck in Australia on a slow, usage-capped connection then I'd prefer not to unless I really wanted to watch the video

[03:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: except that you can't distinguish "no opinion" from "specifically don't want buffering"

[03:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
with the current spec design

[03:10:03.0000] <doublec>
how would the browser know you're on a usage capped connection?

[03:10:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: the author who does set an explicit nobuffer may still get buffering if the browser so choses

[03:10:05.0000] <Lachy>
doublec, probably user preference

[03:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: browsers should always be allowed to optimise for the best user experience, whatever attributes are set

[03:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: is that a hypothetical or are browsers really doing that?

[03:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me considers pay per byte deals a bug

[03:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I'd like to make Safari do that, if I could

[03:12:01.0000] <doublec>
I'm a fan of no attribute - author doesn't want to buffer, with attribute = author does want to buffer, and the browser can override if it feels necessary

[03:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: What about pay-per-month-with-3GB-per-month-cap?

[03:12:03.0000] <doublec>
but on the html mail list authors seemed to think this wasn't a good idea

[03:12:04.0000] <othermaciej>
if the spec remains as-is, then we'll probably either always buffer for autobuffer and never buffer when it's missing

[03:12:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I consider that a bug, too

[03:12:06.0000] <othermaciej>
(unless we know we're on a limited connection or constrained-resource device in which case never buffer at all)

[03:12:07.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: (That and pay-per-byte seem to be the only mobile internet services available here)

[03:12:08.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I approve of capping per second bandwidth, though

[03:12:09.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: It seems reasonable to make that behaviour non-conforming as it may have a disproportionate impact on the authouring side (making bandwidth bills too high is <video> is used) so encouraging people to use a solution that doesn't allow unrequested autobuffering

[03:12:10.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, sure, but that doesn't give the author an opt-out to conserve their own bandwidth. e.g. If I visit a site that embed's a video without specifying autobuffer, and my personal user preferences is to automatically buffer the video anyway, that doesn't allow the author to tell the browser not to

[03:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me pays 9.90 EUR per month for 384 Kb/s without other caps

[03:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
HSDPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS as supported by the tower

[03:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
well i'm very skeptical, but if implementations are going to use it i guess we can change autobuffer from a boolean attribute to autobuffer=always/never/etc (i.e. maybe adding other values in the future)

[03:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
with the lack of an attribute being the "auto" case

[03:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems pretty silly though, why would anyone use a host where bandwidth was an issue?

[03:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so autobuffer=never would buffer more than the lack of the attribute in Firefox 3.5

[03:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: seems like a pretty big fail

[03:15:03.0000] <doublec>
yes, you'd probably need to change the name

[03:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: doesn't matter, nobody is going to use video for ages anyway, plenty of time for ff4 to replace ff3.5

[03:15:05.0000] <doublec>
I still have a fair proportion of users watching video using Firefox 3.1 believe it or not

[03:15:06.0000] <doublec>
according to my logs

[03:16:00.0000] <adactio>
Just a reminder: this isn't just about video, it's also about audio (which I *would* like to use today).

[03:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: "ages" gets longer every time you move the earliest client deployment forward

[03:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
use of either audio or video is not going to take off until we have a common codec

[03:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
everything until then is peanuts

[03:16:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
can't we leave autobuffer alone and fix the bug in webkit?

[03:16:05.0000] <hsivonen>
aside: what's up with the On2 shareholders voting to adjourn repeatedly?

[03:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan_: That is necessary but not sufficient

[03:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so much for getting the news in 2009Q4

[03:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyway it's way past my bedtime

[03:17:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me uses a host with 30KB/s upload bandwidth because it's convenient to run a box at home, and wouldn't want people unnecessarily using up that bandwidth

[03:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
nn :-)

[03:17:05.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: not necessarily ...because I can put fallback content (such as a Flash player) inside the <audio> tags, the element is usable today, even if it isn't implemented in all browsers ...but the autobuffering question is the big sticking point.

[03:17:06.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, consider YouTube providing embed code to authors, as they do now. I'm sure Google wouldn't want every page to begin auto buffering their videos. Currently, YouTube videos don't autobuffer on 3rd party sites.

[03:17:07.0000] <zcorpan_>
it's easy to say "no autobuffer": don't include the <video> at all

[03:17:08.0000] <zcorpan_>
until you want to play it

[03:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan_: Well yes if you want to fuss about with js every time you include a video

[03:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan_: Or use Flash

[03:18:02.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan_, that requires mildly complex scripts to work around a bug that should be easily solveable with markup

[03:18:03.0000] <Philip`>
Those solutions harm the user experience, though

[03:18:04.0000] <jgraham>
Not really compatible with "copy this small fragment of markup to embed this video"

[03:30:00.0000] <annevk>
http://virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=293

[03:31:00.0000] <annevk>
I had a similar experience trying to write an XML parser

[03:32:00.0000] <smaug_>
/me likes the comment "First, it's so much easier to work off of a spec that essentially fits on one page and doesn't have spaghetti hyperlinks" ;)

[03:34:00.0000] <annevk>
sniping from the sideline is easy; where's your spec?

[03:35:00.0000] <annevk>
:)

[03:35:01.0000] <workmad3>
yes, it's a lot easier to work off a spec that fits on one page

[03:35:02.0000] <workmad3>
normally because something that can be specced in one page is fairly simple to do :P

[03:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Something that is specced in many more pages isn't necessarily inherently harder to do

[03:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
It might be just be specced in an overly complex way for your requirements

[03:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
s/be//

[03:38:02.0000] <annevk>
the other points in the post are the more interesting ones imo

[03:38:03.0000] <Philip`>
(Serialising a tree of strings really shouldn't be hard)

[03:40:00.0000] <workmad3>
Philip`: true, good points all

[03:41:00.0000] <workmad3>
I just find it funny when people come across things that are complex and complain that they are then difficult to implement... as if that wasn't frickin' obvious :)

[03:42:00.0000] <annevk>
well, for XML it isn't that obvious

[03:42:01.0000] <annevk>
because 50% of its features are almost never used

[03:43:00.0000] <workmad3>
true

[03:43:01.0000] <annevk>
but are still required for conforming implementations

[03:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does JSON have a parsing spec now?

[03:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
regardless of whether the parsing spec fits on a page or has hyperlinks

[03:45:00.0000] <annevk>
I am a bit scared by his assertion that JSON mandates UTF-32

[03:45:01.0000] <annevk>
I hope that's a mistake

[03:47:00.0000] <workmad3>
annevk: I think he meant that the JSON parser spec mandates that the parser be able to understand UTF-32

[03:47:01.0000] <workmad3>
not that all JSON should be in utf-32 :)

[03:47:02.0000] <annevk>
Opera recently killed UTF-32 support

[03:47:03.0000] <workmad3>
hmm... lunch time

[03:47:04.0000] <hsivonen>
workmad3: what's "the parser spec"?

[03:47:05.0000] <annevk>
HTML5 recommends against UTF-32

[03:48:00.0000] <annevk>
and http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627 mentions UTF-32 including how to detect it but does not seem to require it...

[03:48:01.0000] <workmad3>
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627 <-- rfc for it

[03:48:02.0000] <workmad3>
there's also apparently a slightly different spec for JSON in the ECMAScript 5 spec

[03:48:03.0000] <annevk>
but then it never requires UTF-8 support or UTF-16 either

[03:48:04.0000] <hsivonen>
workmad3: looks like a partial syntax spec to me

[03:48:05.0000] <annevk>
maybe it does not have UA requirements

[03:48:06.0000] <hsivonen>
workmad3: see section 4 for spectacular underspecification

[03:51:00.0000] <annevk>
section 4 assumes the input stream is in Unicode

[03:51:01.0000] <annevk>
or something

[03:51:02.0000] <annevk>
so no encoding requirements there either

[03:51:03.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, section 3 also specifies "JSON text SHALL be encoded in Unicode.  The default encoding is UTF-8.", so I guess that assumption is section 4 is reasonable

[03:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
though, it mentions nothing about what to do with non-conforming streams

[03:52:01.0000] <annevk>
no, I mean that it assumes it is a character stream rather than a byte stream

[03:53:00.0000] <annevk>
there's no requirements about bytes to characters afaict

[03:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
FWIW I would regard the ES5 version of JSON as being "correct" rather than the RFC in as much as the differences are deliberate and reagrded as bug fixes

[03:56:01.0000] <jgraham>
(but that is, I guess, less likely to be helpful with encoding issues)

[04:30:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, the ES5 section assumes the same as the rest of ES5 wrt to text: you get an abstract Unicode stream with UTF-16 surrogates somehow.

[04:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: does ES5 say what to do with stream that don't match the grammar?

[04:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: It throws SyntaxError

[04:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Right so it doesn't really cover standalone json

[04:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Right, it defines the grammar, and the JSON object in ES

[04:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: what about the open-ended permission to accept extensions in the RFC? does ES5 plug that hole?

[04:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: For JSON.parse, anything that doesn't match the grammar throws SyntaxError, so for JSON.parse, yes.

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
cool

[04:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Speaking of ES, anyone found any bugs in Carakan?

[04:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I have :)

[04:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: NO WAI.

[05:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Yes, but when I told you you told me you'd already tested everything, so I stopped looking :-p

[05:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: You didn't tell me

[05:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
(or maybe you did and I just didn't read the logs)

[05:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: He told me and I said it was known

[05:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so now there's a bug saying that extensibility is bad for accessibility: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8619

[05:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(I agree, FWIW, that extenders making stuff up is bad for accessibility)

[05:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
accessibility is bad for extensibility!

[05:30:00.0000] <annevk>
it's not exactly clear what part of that section 8619 is addressing

[05:30:01.0000] <annevk>
the issue marker?

[05:32:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
zcorpan: so you don't want "<style><!--></style>" to be conforming, right?

[05:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmithXX: right

[05:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: so you want a warning reported for <title><!--</title> and <textarea><!--</textarea> ?

[05:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: yes

[05:36:01.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: but not for <title>&lt;!--</title>

[05:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ouch

[05:37:01.0000] <annevk>
anyone have some charset tables handy?

[05:37:02.0000] <annevk>
if you send a FF byte through a HTTP header and it comes out as C3 BF

[05:37:03.0000] <annevk>
what happened?

[05:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh, &lt;!-- is a problem

[05:38:01.0000] <annevk>
decoded as UTF-8

[05:38:02.0000] <annevk>
that's what happened

[05:39:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe even transmitted as UTF-8 hmm

[05:41:00.0000] <annevk>
oh no duh

[05:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: I have a style-content checker live on qa-dev, including the title and textarea warnings

[05:42:00.0000] <annevk>
that's iso-8859-1

[05:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Validators really don't seem like an ideal place to practice clean separation of layers in software architecture

[05:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
since their function is to deal with user errors, and erroneous users don't cleanly separate layers

[05:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[05:48:00.0000] <annevk>
bah

[05:48:01.0000] <annevk>
it seems iso-8859-1 is used in browsers for HTTP

[05:48:02.0000] <annevk>
instead of windows-1252 everywhere

[05:48:03.0000] <annevk>
lame

[05:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Opera trims on \x00 with HTTP headers

[05:49:01.0000] <annevk>
all browsers do

[05:49:02.0000] <annevk>
or maybe it's my server that does

[05:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Only Opera does.

[05:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has tests for this

[05:50:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Probably server.

[05:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I had to write my own server to test a fair bit of stuff

[05:50:04.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: nice

[05:52:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, hmm

[05:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: well, except failing for &lt!-- and --&gt; of course

[05:54:00.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, guess you're right

[05:54:01.0000] <annevk>
but then testing 00 is not really needed

[05:54:02.0000] <annevk>
WebKit is buggy here btw

[05:54:03.0000] <annevk>
or whatever HTTP impl Chrome is using is buggy

[05:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: and it checks in xhtml, which is a bit bogus (but per spec, i filed a spec bug iirc)

[05:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
WebKit has no HTTP impl in it itself

[05:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That's platform specific

[05:55:03.0000] <annevk>
right

[05:55:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Chrome has its own

[05:55:05.0000] <annevk>
anyway, it's buggy

[05:55:06.0000] <annevk>
not necessarily platform

[05:55:07.0000] <gsnedders>
How so?

[05:55:08.0000] <annevk>
browser-specific

[05:55:09.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, WebKit port specific.

[05:55:10.0000] <annevk>
it decodes http using utf-8 or so

[05:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
If they can get away with that, that's very interesting.

[05:56:01.0000] <annevk>
dunno

[05:56:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Opera 10.50 <video> support doesn't work nicely with Wikipedia :-(

[05:56:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I doubt it uses UTF-8 for everything

[05:56:04.0000] <annevk>
but FF ends up as EF BF BD rather than C3 8D

[05:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aside: shipping gstreamer with Opera on Windows looks like a pretty significant change to the previous way of Opera implementing everything from scratch in-house

[05:57:01.0000] <annevk>
and similar story for other characters above 7E

[05:57:02.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, not really

[05:58:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, though some things have changed I guess, we used to have an open source XML parser

[05:58:01.0000] <annevk>
we still use various external sources, but no longer that XML one

[05:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[05:59:00.0000] <annevk>
OpenSSL and Zlib are prolly somewhat well-known

[05:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
FreeType stuff is there too

[05:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: on Windows?

[05:59:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Dunno. I'm just looking at opera:about ;P

[06:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. the menubar is gone in Opera 10.50 on Windows

[06:02:00.0000] <annevk>
also on Linux

[06:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Java seems to make Opera 10.50 on Windows awfully slow

[06:02:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I thought Java didn't work at all in 10.50 currently.

[06:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if using the cortado fallback for <video> is a good idea anymore

[06:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: well, at least I think I had an applet in the tab I just closed

[06:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
no tab resurrection with ctrl-shift-t it seems :-(

[06:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
apparently the tab I thought had cortado in it instead was playing <video> without reaching cortado

[06:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what happened to the idea of making an Ogg/Theora/Vorbis/<video> signed ActiveX control for IE?

[06:19:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: ctrl-z should undo closing tabs

[06:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: that's an odd use of ctrl-z!

[06:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe for reporting on "<!--" in <style> it can only reported as a warning, "Content *appears to* contain the character sequence <!-- without a later occurrence  of the character sequence -->"

[06:22:00.0000] <Huvet>
ok, I'm definately going crazy... can't I make html5lib remove everything but divs when parsing?

[06:22:01.0000] <Huvet>
there's some kind of patch here: http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/issues/detail?id=62

[06:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: do you mean title and textarea?

[06:22:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yeah

[06:22:04.0000] <Huvet>
but that seems rejected, and the fifth comment posts some code, that I can't get to work

[06:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess it's a warning already.. myabe just need to tweek the wording

[06:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: hmm, what about the case of <style> also?

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: in style it could be straightforward to implement it as an error, right?

[06:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I just tested and "&lt;" is getting interpreted by v.nu as "<"

[06:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
in style also

[06:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa

[06:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
that's a bug

[06:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems so

[06:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
odd. I don't see the bug in Gecko

[06:33:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: maybe a problem in how I implemented the check?

[06:34:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, what would you use instead of ctrl+z ?

[06:34:01.0000] <annevk>
i learned it by trying ctrl+z :)

[06:34:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Alt+Home, and click on "Recently Closed Tabs".

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: that's possible

[06:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: ctrl-shift-t :-)

[06:35:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: because when I test with http://c.validator.nu/debug/ set, I get "Warning: Characters: &lt;--." as expected, instead of "Warning: Characters: <".

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I expect ctrl-z to undo the last modification I've made to the content of the frontmost tab

[06:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: very odd

[06:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: it's possible that V.nu and Gecko are out of sync

[06:36:03.0000] <annevk>
TabAtkins, ctrl+z seems easier

[06:36:04.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, heh

[06:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: fwiw, I just implemented it using the existing TextContentHandler and corresponding new datatype

[06:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: But what if you're editting a textarea in that tab?  Then there's a conflict in what should be Undone.

[06:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
and the new datatype class just gets the character stream same as any other

[06:38:00.0000] <annevk>
they don't need to be mutually exclusive

[06:38:01.0000] <annevk>
e.g. tabs could just be put on the stack

[06:38:02.0000] <annevk>
not sure how it actually works in Opera

[06:38:03.0000] <annevk>
I only ever use it when I press ctrl+w per accident

[06:39:00.0000] <annevk>
(Opera puts them on a stack)

[06:39:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: They're both just events in the stack

[06:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: There's nothing magic about tabs being closed

[06:39:03.0000] <annevk>
(though some things are global-stack and some are page-stack)

[06:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me has a weird mix of expectations about how undo close tab should work

[06:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: (a) what Anne just said about the different stacks.  (b) There's still a mental conflict.  If I close something and then turn to my textarea and realize I need to undo what I just wrote, I'll be surprised when I reopen the old tab.

[06:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
I think I expect a unique undo command for tabs but avaliable from the edit menu

[06:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wants how to cope with TOCs is different forms in Anolis

[06:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/wants/wonders/

[06:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Like, coping with multi-file TOCs, single-file TOCs, TOCs just for the current section, just of one level...

[06:44:01.0000] <gsnedders>
TOCs just for the current section I think I can probably ignore

[06:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Why do you need any of that?

[06:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Also, if anyone is interested, html5lib tip is no quicker at parsing the complete spec in unladen than it is in normal CPython

[06:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Multi-doc TOC: see http://w3.org/TR/CSS21/; just for a certain section: see some section of CSS 2.1, the TOC in HTML 5

[06:51:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: We should put together a benchmark and then try to get the unladen people to use it ;)

[06:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Flexibility of depth: see the short TOC in HTML 5

[06:52:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: what doesn't work nice with video on wikipedia?

[06:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: clicking the browser-native play button doesn't start playing soon

[06:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
then if I come back later, the video has played to the last frame, but pressing the button again doesn't restart it

[06:53:01.0000] <zcorpan>
the latter issue is probably because seeking doesn't work yet

[06:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ah

[06:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
is there a url i can use to test the first issue?

[06:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog

[06:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. it could be a server problem

[06:55:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but Firefox gives more useful feedback while it is waiting for the server

[06:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
indeed

[06:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(it plays fine for me)

[07:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8567 was the spec bug

[07:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me looks

[07:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: can't <!-- checking be in the tokenizer instead?

[07:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: it could--by adding more states

[07:04:01.0000] <zcorpan>
true

[07:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me fixes more issues in html5lib

[07:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
might also get messy with the <!--> thing

[07:05:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it seems like it would be only useful for conformance checkers, not for other uses of the tokenizer/parser

[07:05:03.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: I have a local patch that fixes something

[07:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
I just don't recall what

[07:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
(not the thing that you just pushed at least)

[07:06:02.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't care overly about title/textarea; checking script and style is most important

[07:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
my research showed that people don't use <!-- in title or textarea, so it might be pointless to check them

[07:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Oh it was to raise a DeprecationWarning when the BS treebuilder is used

[07:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah

[07:14:00.0000] <annevk>
how the hell do you get access to request headers in python?

[07:15:00.0000] <annevk>
where is the basic http interaction tutorial that does not involve making requests from Python?

[07:15:01.0000] <annevk>
i can never find it

[07:15:02.0000] <annevk>
never

[07:15:03.0000] <annevk>
/me is just a little frustrated with his lack of luck

[07:15:04.0000] <annevk>
I could do it in PHP, but I wanna move away from that at some point...

[07:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well if you need the raw unprocessed stuff and are using CGI you presumably want os.environ

[07:24:00.0000] <annevk>
and how do you get headers out of that?

[07:24:01.0000] <annevk>
environment variables do not exactly appear to be documented :/

[07:24:02.0000] <annevk>
os.environ has not a single pointer ?!

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
CGI doesn't pass raw unprocessed stuff

[07:26:01.0000] <Huvet>
can I trust that the document is properly nested (all StartTags have an EndTag) in a subclass to HTMLSanitazion (while overriding sanitize_token)?

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
It just gives you environment variables like HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE and HTTP_X_FOO_BAR etc, parsed from the headers

[07:27:01.0000] <Huvet>
hmm... I guess not... because only the tree I get from html5lib is properly nested...

[07:27:02.0000] <Huvet>
i guess

[07:28:00.0000] <annevk>
Philip`, if I set a header test I do not get it back with HTTP_TEST

[07:29:00.0000] <annevk>
or HTTP_test or HTTP_X_TEST

[07:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Huvet: Dunno whether <img> will give both

[07:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
Huvet: Sounds like that's working at the tokenizer level, so there's no nesting fixups or guarantees

[07:30:00.0000] <Huvet>
thanks, that figures

[07:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: What if you set a header X-Test?

[07:30:02.0000] <annevk>
never mind

[07:30:03.0000] <annevk>
I fail

[07:30:04.0000] <annevk>
forgot to import os

[07:30:05.0000] <annevk>
though also Python fail for not throwing server errors

[07:31:00.0000] <annevk>
imo

[07:31:01.0000] <annevk>
cheerio

[07:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: fyi, the problem was I was seeing with &lt!-- was just a stupid oversight in the code I added

[07:31:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
fixed now

[07:31:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
sorry for the noise

[07:31:05.0000] <Philip`>
annevk: import cgitb

[07:31:06.0000] <Philip`>
or something like that

[07:31:07.0000] <Philip`>
to get error reports

[07:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: So, we need some file that takes a second or two to parse

[07:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I suggest the first n lines of the HTML5 spec

[07:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me takes a break

[07:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok

[07:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: btw, what's the rationale for having the error messages in TextContentHandler also report the namespace?

[07:36:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., "The text content of element style from namespace http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml was not in the required format"

[07:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: consistency with way Jing reports stuff, IIRC

[07:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
import cgitb; cgitb.enable()

[07:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if somebody is going to make a user-friendly validator frontend that gives more understandable error messages

[07:37:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I see

[07:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
But you will get errors in /var/log/apache2/error.log or similar if the import failed

[07:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but it's not consistent with how v.nu reports stuff

[07:39:00.0000] <annevk>
for setRequestHeader() it seems browsers just go for UTF-8 octets?

[07:39:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[07:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Seems like there's an opportunity to match the low-level validator output against patterns from common user errors, and give more high-level advice about what the problem is and how to fix it)

[07:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: that would involve some guessing about the root cause of the user error, right?

[07:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: anyway, if I understand you correctly, hsivonen has some of that already in the htmlparser error messages

[07:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Call it "heuristics" rather than "guessing" :-)

[07:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[07:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
and have it informed by statistics

[07:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: first part of many htmlparser error messages reports what the actual error is, then the last part reports, "Probable cause: ..."

[07:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Is that ever based on patterns of more than one error message?

[07:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: no, I don't think so, not currently

[07:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me hasn't actually used the validator enough to know whether those problems occur much and could be reported better, so he's just making this all up and could be completely wrong

[07:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me imagines it's harder when you have to actually implement it

[07:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
basing reporting on patterns of more than one error condition would seem to require keeping a lot of state information around about what errors have already occurred

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sure

[07:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
Memory is cheap :-)

[07:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[07:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, I gotta get some food

[07:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
bbiab

[08:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: what you describe could be implemented in a third-party app that consumes output from v.nu

[09:13:00.0000] <abernier>
html5 introduces new elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, ... is it a good idea for html4 authoring to replace them by <div class="(header|footer|nav)" ?

[09:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
abernier, doesn't really matter, unless it will make transition easier or something.

[09:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
abernier, the point of the new elements is to add standardized semantics, you don't get those in HTML4 for these elements either way.

[09:33:00.0000] <abernier>
AryehGregor: yes, and adding semantics through class attributes is a quite common concept, no?

[09:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
abernier, but they aren't standardized semantics.  Nothing other than your own page is going to treat <div class="header"> any differently from <div class="snafflefloozer">.  For all any third-party semantics-inferring tool knows, you prefer to call your headers snafflefloozers and vice versa.  So there's no reason to use one over the other except personal preference/legibility/etc.

[09:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I know users underestimate how much effort development takes, but this is still a pretty impressive statement: ". . . I want everything perfect and without any flaws. Is that to much to ask ?"  http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=16482

[10:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me supposes that when open-source software takes over the world, users will interact with developers more and have a better understanding of how much effort it takes to implement something well.

[10:51:00.0000] <smaug_>
so what is the current way to get changes to the draft; do I always need to file bugs @w3c or is the old way (send email to whatwg) still enough?

[10:51:01.0000] <smaug_>
Hixie: ^^^

[10:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
smaug_: either

[10:57:01.0000] <smaug_>
ok, thanks

[11:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: BTW I know a blog engine that always uses a proper serializer

jgraham: NAmely?

http://code.cmlenz.net/diva/wiki/Divan

[11:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
It fails on "easy to set up and use" though

[11:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
(but you didn't list those as requirments)

[11:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
(in particular you need an atompub client to create/edit entires)

[11:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
(and you need couchdb which is not trivial to run in all hosting situaions)

[11:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Seriously: You probably don't want to be using this."

[11:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
(on the framework for which Divan is an example application)

[11:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
That doesn't sound entirely promising

[12:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oooo, MS have joined SVG WG.

Could someone give me insight as to why two margins are appearing? - http://frohsenwebdesign.com/projects/css3-tests/multiple-floats-and-margin.html

[13:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
bfrohs, what do you mean, two margins?

[13:11:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Go to the link (refresh if you went to immediately). I have a top margin of 50 px set to the second element in each group

[13:11:01.0000] <bfrohs>
It appears between the first and second element as well as above the first element

[13:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is intrigued by the seemingly random use of <section> and <aside> instead of <div> here

[13:12:00.0000] <bfrohs>
It's from a website I'm working on... basically removed pieces of code until it was the bare minimum - didn't take the time to change things.

[13:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What browser are you testing in?

[13:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It looks very different between Firefox and Chrome.

[13:13:02.0000] <bfrohs>
Firefox 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 on ubuntu

[13:13:03.0000] <bfrohs>
Yes, that's why I'm confused

[13:13:04.0000] <bfrohs>
Hoping someone has insight here

[13:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Tried #css?

[13:14:01.0000] <bfrohs>
On freenode?

[13:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes.

[13:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Curious.

[13:15:02.0000] <bfrohs>
Nope - will do now. I'm not one to use IRC

[13:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . you're using IRC.

[13:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can make a more minimal test case, by the way.

[13:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
A lot of the stuff you have is still extraneous.

[13:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Would be easier to understand if you only had like three elements there, and a minimal set of rules.

[13:18:00.0000] <bfrohs>
The problem only occurs with floats - hence the multiple floats... and the first rules (before /*important*/) are purely cosmetic

[13:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can get rid of a lot of elements, like the .layout > aside.

[13:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Would make things simpler to look at.

[13:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
cosmetics have no place in testcases :)

[13:19:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
You have relative positioning, etc., all extraneous.

[13:20:00.0000] <bfrohs>
Alright, thanks. I'll take care of that now :)

[13:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: If I'm designing an XML vocabulary, I like to prefix every element and attribute name with my name, so that I feel it belongs to me

[13:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also it means people can return it to me if I accidentally lose it somewhere

[13:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Or if it's stolen

[13:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: It wouldn't help in that case, the thieves would just strip off the obvious identifying marks

[13:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But then it wouldn't be stealing

[13:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
That's why I also hide my name steganographically in the first letter of every element and attribute name in the vocabulary

[13:23:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Since they wouldn't be my elements anymore

[13:42:00.0000] <bfrohs>
If anyone wants an update to my problem from earlier regarding CSS in Firefox, it's a bug in the Gecko engine as far as anyone can tell. Thanks for the direction to #css ! :)

[13:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
bfrohs: I take it you will file a bug? :)

[13:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
(assuming there isn't one already)

[13:48:00.0000] <bfrohs>
jgraham: Aye, taking care of now.

[13:55:00.0000] <bfrohs>
jgraham: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=537808 if you want it fixed

[14:02:00.0000] <jwalden>
bfrohs: generally, when filing bugs, you should create a self-contained testcase and upload it to the bug; a URL might change in the future (even if it's something you control -- what if you forget about the external reference?), so it's important to capture exactly what was there for permanent reference -- mind doing that?

[14:02:01.0000] <egn>
hi, for an html5 media element, how would I signal it to stop buffering?

[14:02:02.0000] <jwalden>
inline external stylesheets, create data: URLs for images and such, etc.

[14:02:03.0000] <annevk>
not include the autobefuffer attribute

[14:02:04.0000] <bfrohs>
jwalden: yeah, I can. But the location is permanent... but I'll still do just in case.

[14:03:00.0000] <annevk>
egn, ^^

[14:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is the procedure for getting canconfirm or editbugs on Mozilla's Bugzilla still to e-mail Gerv?

[14:03:02.0000] <jwalden>
AryehGregor: that's one method; you thinking of asking?

[14:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jwalden, yes.  I seem to meet the requirements at <http://www.gerv.net/hacking/before-you-mail-gerv.html> for at least canconfirm.

[14:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Bugs I've filed: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?emailreporter1=1&emailtype1=exact&email1=Simetrical%2Bff⊙gc

[14:04:02.0000] <jwalden>
AryehGregor: bugmail address?

[14:04:03.0000] <jwalden>
ah

[14:04:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Simetrical+ff⊙gc

[14:04:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I have one patch that's r+ and awaiting super-review, and a few other bugs with test-cases (mostly inline as data URLs).

[14:05:00.0000] <jwalden>
AryehGregor: fixed; bugzilla's administrative permissions are sufficiently fine-grained that there are probably at least a dozen or so people with ability to grant those

[14:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
jwalden, thanks.

[14:05:02.0000] <egn>
annevk: k, it's not autobuffering, but I need to be able to stop buffering after a play() happens.  I think when I pause() it continues to buffer

[14:05:03.0000] <jwalden>
no problem

[14:05:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
MediaWiki just gives everyone editbugs, because we're crazy.  \o/

[14:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Bugzilla actually works pretty well for that, surprisingly.  Not much software does.  It keeps good logs and nothing much is irreversible.)

[14:06:01.0000] <roc>
given that we've had to remove editbugs from people from time to time, that wouldn't work for us

[14:06:02.0000] <jwalden>
egn: buffering is really a quality-of-implementation issue for the client, except for the hinting mechanism (which may, but probably should not, be ignored)

[14:06:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
At that stage we usually just disable their account.  :)

[14:06:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, just a random comment.

[14:06:05.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: And if they create a new one?

[14:06:06.0000] <roc>
that's a good point

[14:06:07.0000] <roc>
Dashiva: that tends to not happen

[14:06:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, same as if they create a new wiki account.

[14:06:09.0000] <roc>
for some reason

[14:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, if they want to be disruptive they could also create a new account and write a script to file a constant stream of bugs with goatse hidden in them.  Or even do it by hand.

[14:07:01.0000] <roc>
the exact limits of craziness and malice on the Internet are hard to understand

[14:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, it's worked for us so far, although of course we have a much less active Bugzilla than Mozilla does.

[14:08:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me wonders what gnome's bugzilla does, given that it might be the largest out there publicly these days

[14:12:00.0000] <egn>
jwalden: hm, k. is there any way I can just kill the media element which would stop the buffering after a play()?

[14:13:00.0000] <jwalden>
egn: not in a cross-browser manner, although disconnecting it from the DOM, making sure it's paused, and then nulling out any and all names and properties that refer to it will likely expedite the process

[14:14:00.0000] <jwalden>
garbage collection is perhaps the primary non-deterministic behavior on the web that will never be standardized

[14:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
egn: You could open lots of popup windows so the user gets annoyed enough to terminate their browser process

[14:15:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me snickers

[14:15:01.0000] <egn>
jwalden: k, thanks

[14:19:00.0000] <roc>
egn: if you remove the element from the DOM, it will automatically pause and IIRC we'll stop the download

[15:08:00.0000] <egn>
roc: thanks

[15:32:00.0000] <egn>
roc: I created the element with document.createElement("audio"); can I still remove that from the DOM? I tried fooAudioElement.remove() with no luck (using jquery)

[15:32:01.0000] <roc>
did you put it in the DOM?

[15:33:00.0000] <egn>
I don't think so, I just created it, set the src, and play()ed it

[15:33:01.0000] <roc>
ah

[15:33:02.0000] <roc>
hmm

[15:34:00.0000] <roc>
ok, stopping it from downloading is kinda hard

[15:34:01.0000] <roc>
you can drop all references to it and wait for GC to kill it, but that's unknown delay

[15:34:02.0000] <egn>
ok. should I just put an empty <audio> element on page load and then just change it's src and such?

[15:35:00.0000] <roc>
you could insert it into an inactive document so that its owner document is an inactive document, which will stop the download, but that's rather obscure

[15:35:01.0000] <egn>
k

[15:35:02.0000] <roc>
what are you actually trying to do

[15:35:03.0000] <egn>
change songs

[15:36:00.0000] <roc>
can't you just change the .src and call load()?

[15:36:01.0000] <egn>
so once a song changes, I don't want it to buffer the old one

[15:36:02.0000] <egn>
I'll try that

[15:41:00.0000] <egn>
works, thanks


2010-01-05
[16:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i think we need a state that is neither "Rejected" nor "Accepted" but which is "I don't know what you want"

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: because i have the feeling that some of these bugs that i'm marking "Rejected" due to unclear requests are going to just be raised as issues, and will waste a lot of the WG's time, where if the request had just been made clear in the bug, I maybe would have been fine with making the change

[16:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I suppose marking the bug NEEDSINFO and asking for more info might be too subtle - I think it's fine to have a "Did Not Understand Request" state or whatever

[16:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, i'll change to "Did Not Understand Request" instead of "Rejected" when marking the bug NEEDSINFO

[16:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[16:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you could even directly encourage the originator to reopen the bug with additional info in that case if they can expand on their request

[16:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i do do that, in the Rationale field

[16:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sounds good

[16:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8210 - do you think that should be a drawFocusRect(x,y,w,h) call or a drawFocusPath() call that uses the current path?

[18:12:00.0000] <roc>
If we start offering drawFocusRing, aren't we going to get requests for all kinds of native look-and-feel drawing in canvas?

[18:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: possibly

[18:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
roc: if that's a problem, i'm certainly open to other suggestions to solve the focus ring problem

[18:21:00.0000] <roc>
it's not clear what problem the bug reporter is trying to solve

[18:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-canvas-api/2009OctDec/thread.html#msg27

[18:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
basically how do you handle users who have magnifiers that follow the caret and system focus

[18:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
or who have the need for high-contrast focus rings

[18:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Since when was it 4am?

[18:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, yeah. My computer is still on Europe/Stockholm, and I'm in Europe/London.

[19:17:00.0000] <annevk>
I cannot believe I'm awake

[19:32:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, "in optional canDrawCustom" does not specify a type

[20:34:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me snickers at the example in http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=4461&to=4462

[21:04:00.0000] <annevk>
so does Python in CGI mode suck because CGI sucks so much?

[21:04:01.0000] <annevk>
if so, why hasn't that been replaced over the years?

[21:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: oops

[21:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8232 .... what?

[21:52:00.0000] <annevk>
I like how bz pointed out that browsers do byte-inflation rather than fiddling with ISO-8859-1

[21:52:01.0000] <annevk>
It is more or less the same of course, but it makes it seem much more simple :)

[22:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: nm

[22:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: it wouldn't be byte inflation when it's not inflating :-P

[22:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
it'd be byte stripping or something

[22:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
pretty bogus to send just the lower byte of a two byte codepoint, though

[22:41:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, ah, doh, byte-deflation then

[22:41:01.0000] <annevk>
I'd personally be happy with switching HTTP to use UTF-8 everywhere, break a few servers, and patch it all up

[22:42:00.0000] <annevk>
but that's not going to happen

[22:43:00.0000] <annevk>
and fiddling with the lower byte (thanks for that, didn't know the term I had to use yet) seems the easiest solution...

[22:43:01.0000] <annevk>
at some point we'll overload this method with ByteArray or whatever we end up calling it and encourage people to use that I guess

[22:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that just switching to UTF-8 is the right solution

[22:50:00.0000] <annevk>
do you know anything about Chrome's HTTP implementation?

[22:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
not off-hand

[22:51:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems to actually use UTF-8 at least here

[22:51:01.0000] <annevk>
if they use it everywhere...

[22:51:02.0000] <annevk>
then maybe there is a way

[23:53:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, from looking at http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/ I cannot find code that deals with the ISO-8859-1 thingie...

[23:54:00.0000] <annevk>
though for parsing location headers it does call EscapeNonASCII saying something about a compat issue...

[23:54:01.0000] <annevk>
makes me wonder what other browsers do there

[23:59:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, progressBar.getElementsByTagName('span').textContent is also buggy

[23:59:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, maybe progressBar.firstChild.textContent

[23:59:02.0000] <annevk>
or [0] of course

[00:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
oops

[00:04:00.0000] <annevk>
arguably <code title="">-//W3C//DTD&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;4.0//EN</code> is somewhat problematic as it does not work if I copy and paste that

[00:05:00.0000] <annevk>
might be better to use actual spaces and have a class="token" with .token { white-space:pre } or some such

[00:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
browsers copy U+0020, actually

[00:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
bug list is down to 178 I see

[00:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that's good progress

[00:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
it would be going faster if people didn't decide today was the day to file a bazillion bugs :-P

[00:08:01.0000] <annevk>
mkay

[00:08:02.0000] <annevk>
are public ids case-sensitive in SGML?

[00:08:03.0000] <annevk>
surprises me

[00:11:00.0000] <annevk>
looks like XMLHttpRequest will need at least one more Last Call

[00:12:00.0000] <nessy>
OMG - tell me I'm not the only person on this planet that has 13 different browsers installed on one computer

[00:12:01.0000] <nessy>
(admittedly in 3 different OSes)

[00:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: public IDs are opaque strings in SGML

[00:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I'm pretty sure they don't get case-folded in SGML

[00:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: I have that many on just one OS plus the ones on the other OSs

[00:15:00.0000] <nessy>
uff, good - I thought I was going mental

[00:15:01.0000] <nessy>
I'm just preparing demos for a html5 video tutorial

[00:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: what's the status of the Theora ActiveX project?

[00:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
do I get to count Safari 4.0.4, my WebKit nightly, my release build of Safari trunk and my debug build of Safari trunk as 4 different browsers?

[00:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I counted different builds from one codebase as separate

[00:16:03.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: unfortunately not much progress yet - needs somebody to fund the poor soul - he has a main job, but would be prepared to reduce to do the thing

[00:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: I see

[00:17:01.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: I did count 3 different FF builds, so I guess, yes

[00:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: indeed I see 55 bugs resolved so far this month, but there has been a fair bit of incoming

[00:17:03.0000] <nessy>
actually, no, I only counted different browsers, not different versions - otherwise that'd be 3 more

[00:18:00.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: we have FOMS coming up in 2 weeks and he will be there, so we'll see how far we can push it

[00:18:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, kk

[00:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari, counting only distinct browsers

[00:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: is the current recommended thing for IE support to use cortado as a fallback for <video>?

[00:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I have not bothered lately with Camino, OmniWeb, iCab or anything else

[00:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: no IEs on VMs?

[00:22:00.0000] <nessy>
othermaciej: me, too, but 3 times, because of 3 different OSes

[00:22:01.0000] <nessy>
hsivonen: yes, cortado fallback right now

[00:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nessy: ok thanks

[00:22:03.0000] <nessy>
requires java installation, but there's a fair few of those around

[00:22:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I do also have IE on my Windows partition

[00:22:05.0000] <nessy>
go to http://theora.org/cortado

[00:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure if IE/Mac is still runnable, but I don't have a copy here

[00:23:01.0000] <nessy>
IE/Mac died a long time ago, I think

[00:23:02.0000] <nessy>
never went back to it

[00:23:03.0000] <nessy>
but yeah, that on Windoze

[00:23:04.0000] <nessy>
bbiab

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
IE/Mac runs on Snow Leopard

[00:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nice, the progress/meter i18n can of worms is gone

[00:49:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[00:49:01.0000] <annevk>
getPosition takes an object

[00:50:00.0000] <annevk>
we discussed using object for APIs once in the WebApps WG and decided not to go there...

[00:50:01.0000] <annevk>
oh well

[00:50:02.0000] <annevk>
no consistency in the past, no consistency in the future either

[00:51:00.0000] <annevk>
one of the many flawed particles of the Web platform

[01:11:00.0000] <annevk>
the point Kai made has been addressed before

[01:11:01.0000] <annevk>
but I can't find the email :/

[01:12:00.0000] <annevk>
/me lets it be someone else's problem

[01:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
well I just took a fresh shot at replying

[01:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if you have an older email to cite that would be nice too

[01:14:00.0000] <annevk>
cannot find it

[01:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the id numbers for saved docs on the live DOM viewer are surprisingly small

[01:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess the user base isn't particularly large

[01:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if there are test cases for load/unload/pagehide/pageshow events for about:blank loading into an iframe

[01:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is onpageshow supposed to work as a content attribute?

[01:29:00.0000] <annevk>
per HTML5, yes

[01:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what about real world?

[01:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/342

[01:29:03.0000] <hsivonen>
is iframe not firing it or the handler not supported?

[01:29:04.0000] <annevk>
but only for body and frameset

[01:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh

[01:30:01.0000] <annevk>
per html5 anyway

[01:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
why frameset but not iframe?

[01:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
body and frameset are equivalent

[01:30:04.0000] <Hixie>
iframe and frame are equilavent

[01:30:05.0000] <annevk>
presumably because frameset takes the role of body

[01:30:06.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[01:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is it even possible to register a pageshow event handler for an iframe that loads about:blank before it's too late?

[01:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
parser-created iframe that is

[01:33:02.0000] <annevk>
prolly not

[01:33:03.0000] <annevk>
but you could load it again

[01:33:04.0000] <annevk>
after you add a listener to the window object

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what history behind about:blank loading synchronously is

[01:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
not that it matters at this point to know who the guilty party is

[01:59:00.0000] <annevk>
i guess so that you can directly manipulate the document

[01:59:01.0000] <annevk>
makes sense to me

[02:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It's quite an annoyance

[02:01:00.0000] <annevk>
speaking as an author, i trump you :p

[02:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me was about to say the same thing as annevk 

[02:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
you shouldn't be using about:blank-created DOMs, because they aren in the quirks mode

[02:02:00.0000] <annevk>
thankfully jgraham loses with me

[02:02:01.0000] <annevk>
:p

[02:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is there any way to put an about:blank frame in standards mode?

[02:03:01.0000] <annevk>
about:standards-blank

[02:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I thinks there isn't

[02:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
even if you document.write a standards-mode doctype into it?

[02:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: document.writing into it implies document.open, which blows away html, head and body

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and the "feature" here is that you get html, head and body synchronously and for free

[02:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, <iframe src="data:text/html,&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;"></iframe> will give you a blank document in standards mode

[02:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: but asynchronously

[02:07:01.0000] <annevk>
and in a different origin in some browsers

[02:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, yeah.

[02:07:03.0000] <annevk>
though that's a bug per HTML5

[02:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
about:blank is standards mode in opera

[02:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: does it have a doctype?

[02:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: bug or deliberate feature?

[02:19:02.0000] <annevk>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">

[02:19:03.0000] <zcorpan>
i've only seen one minor bug about it, so maybe we can change it to standards mode in other browsers too

[02:19:04.0000] <annevk>
has a <title> too

[02:19:05.0000] <hsivonen>
that's interesting

[02:19:06.0000] <annevk>
"Blank page"

[02:20:00.0000] <annevk>
and the root element has dir set to rtl

[02:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: is the string localized?

[02:20:02.0000] <annevk>
euh ltr

[02:20:03.0000] <annevk>
no idea

[02:20:04.0000] <hsivonen>
about:blank in Gecko has a doctype, too

[02:20:05.0000] <hsivonen>
but a quirky one

[02:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think it would be nice if about:blank were standards mode

[02:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how OS X interprets the encoding of non-ASCII filenames on 8-bit-filename-filesystems (like FAT)

[02:22:00.0000] <workmad3>
about:blank checks as valid in FF as well

[02:22:01.0000] <workmad3>
or at least, it reckons it's valid in the w3c validator

[02:22:02.0000] <workmad3>
web dev toolbar in FF reckons it's quirky :/

[02:23:00.0000] <annevk>
the validator is out of touch with reality

[02:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. if I'm reading the code right, about:blank in Gecko has or doesn't have a doctype depending on how it got created

[02:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
fun

[02:26:00.0000] <workmad3>
heh :)

[02:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: can about:blank be changed to standards mode in gecko?

[02:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: as in can authors change its mode or could a Gecko developer land code for changing it in the engine?

[02:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
document.write()ing a doctype seems simple enough as a way to get standards mode

[02:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it doesn't depend on about:blank being synchronous in any way but it's convenient enough

[02:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think there are compat reasons that about:blank has to be in quirks mode

[02:38:03.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: You have a somewhat unusual view of "simple enough"

[02:38:04.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: the latter

[02:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: if you're about to poke at the DOM of a frame. doing someFrame.contentDocument.write("<!DOCTYPE html>") first seems prety simple to me

[02:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: can you cite the compat reasons?

[02:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan: not offhand

[02:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: The incantation isn't hard once you know it; it is realising that that is the right incantation that is the non-simple part

[02:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sure

[02:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that would be true of any special incantation, other than changing the default

[02:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if about:blank in a standards mode document could be in standards mode

[02:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but I would not be surprised if there are standards-mode pages with about:blank iframes that they depend on being quirky

[02:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: probably not, but you might a get a better answer from Boris.

[02:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
othermaciej: it has not caused much of a problem for opera to always use standards mode

[02:44:00.0000] <annevk>
much of or no problem?

[02:44:01.0000] <annevk>
/me hasn't seen a thing

[02:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i've seen one bug where it caused unwanted top margin because we insert a <p> when pressing enter in contenteditable

[02:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
which could either be solved by using quirks mode or by not using <p>

[02:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i think we might move away from <p> anyway

[02:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. so is pageshow supposed to fire on initial page load, too, and not only when navigating back to a page in the back-forward cache?

[02:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
apparently yes

[02:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and Gecko and WebKit either differ in handler support or in event firing

[02:53:02.0000] <zcorpan>
does pageshow use the Event interface?

[02:53:03.0000] <hsivonen>
dunno

[02:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't like how pageshow is defined

[02:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it makes it needlessly awkward to have code that *only* runs when restoring from b/f cache

[02:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if only one of "load" or "pageshow" fired, you could easily put code in one handler or both depending on whether it's one-time, every-time or restore-only initialization

[02:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not only that but "load" has to do complete initialization anyway, to support browsers that don't have "pageshow"

[02:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe I gave this complaint to the folks who first implemented these events for Gecko but they were unconvinced

[03:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
not too late to change it

[03:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hasn't Gecko had a b/f cache for years already?

[03:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yes it has

[03:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I discussed it with the engineers working on it before it shipped, years ago

[03:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'd suspect at this point a new event ("pagerestore"?) would be required

[03:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
although I think it's hard to depend on "pageshow" always firing, and yet still be compatible with browsers that never fire it at all

[03:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
wtf? http://rebuildingtheweb.com/en/invitation-html5-team/

[03:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I guess he missed the design principle debates

[03:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
"The first phase in these debates is a challenge, from me to Ian Hickson [...] to debate me on the following topic: Error messages should be displayed for corrupt HTML5."

[03:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(as if showing errors were up to Hixie to decide)

[03:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
I guess I shouldn't be too surprised he's still pushing for draconian error handling in HTML, even though that debate has been over for years.

weird. I no longer see his byline on xhtml.com

[03:34:02.0000] <zcorpan>
as about in-depth, well the threads are well indented at least

[03:35:00.0000] <annevk>
for some people standards is fun

[03:35:01.0000] <annevk>
for others it's process

[03:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
standards are a tool

[03:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
for getting interop

[03:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
nothing more, imho

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
(sometimes they're not even the best tool for that job)

[03:36:01.0000] <annevk>
i meant working on standards

[03:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh working on standards is a lot of fun :-)

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
especially when it's like-minded people working on things together

[03:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's less fun when it's people who disagree on the fundamental goals

[03:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
down with people who disagree

[03:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I replied to his post (perhaps foolishly)

[03:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
validator.nu shows error messages for corrupt html5

[03:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, based on what he's previously said on the topic, he means for browsers to show error messages to users

[03:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
I responded to his post too.

[03:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: of course, but the post didn't say that :)

[03:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://vocamus.net/dave/?cat=25 seems interesting

[03:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok got it down to 157 bugs

[03:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
i was aiming for 150

[03:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i started about 20 higher than i expected to start

[03:56:03.0000] <Hixie>

Heh

[05:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
I obviously shouldn't have replied

[05:38:02.0000] <annevk>
me neither I think

[05:38:03.0000] <annevk>
but I did

[05:39:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm already worried about flames

[05:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I have to wonder if were baited to reply accidentally or intentionally

[05:40:00.0000] <annevk>
quite surprising how much we're aligned on certain points

[05:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
evidence of groupthink!

[05:41:01.0000] <annevk>
heh

[05:41:02.0000] <annevk>
might be

[05:42:00.0000] <annevk>
earlier today when I discussed that email with othermaciej neither of us mentioned a view point but we both knew it was the same

[05:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Pretty sure it was an intentional baiting.

[05:42:02.0000] <annevk>
it struck me a little later how convenient that was

[05:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the "Browser implementations" thread?

[05:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, yeah, I think so

[05:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't see evidence of baiting (not really sure what we were baited into if so)

[05:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think the supposed baiting was the suggestion that only released specs contribute to the legacy

[05:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
re the autobuffer thread, I'm not entirely convinced that making autobuffer itself a tri-state attribute (on/off, or absent) is impossible, despite it being boolean in Firefox 3.5

[05:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
But I'm not really sure that it was baiting (I'm not sure what the point would be)

[05:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Agreed but I don't really see the value in taking the risk

[05:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Firefox has pretty high uptake on updates

[05:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
since autobuffer is, I believe, currently only implemented in Firefox, and its omission currently has the same effect as autobuffer=off should have, then authors can simply omit the attribute for the relatively short transition from FF 3.5 to 3.6

[05:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there are advantages and disadvantages to reusing autobuffer vs. minting a new buffer attribute

[05:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
so, if 3.6 supported autobuffer as tri-state, then the issue would not have serious long term consequnces

[05:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
a new buffer attribute could be more clear and would have less risk of legacy conflict, but at the same time it might leave us stuck with two attributes

[05:53:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm planning to list both options when I file the bug

[05:53:04.0000] <jgraham>
I think we could obsolete autobuffer at this stage

[05:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
of course, using buffer="..." as tri-state, and obsoleting autobuffer would also be acceptable to me

[05:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think there is significant content out there relying on autobuffer for it to be impossible to remove once buffer="" is more widely supported

[05:55:01.0000] <annevk>
autobuffer can easily be removed

[05:55:02.0000] <annevk>
that was never the concern

[05:55:03.0000] <annevk>
afaict

[05:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: Gecko 1.9.2 is in RC in mobile. changes to the engine feature set are highly theoretical at this point

[05:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
also, I'm slighly less convinced about the need for tri-state buffering, until I've seen more evidence about what sort of heuristics browsers can realistically apply when the attribute is absent to make it significantly different from the no-buffering case.

[06:22:00.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, did you file a bug on <img>.x/y

[06:23:00.0000] <annevk>
or can they can be nuked from the browsers

[06:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I don't know what that is

[06:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: is it something we're missing?

[06:24:02.0000] <annevk>
it is something that's not in Opera of which we have a old bug report from 2007 or so about a compat issue

[06:24:03.0000] <annevk>
it is apparently in Firefox and WebKit

[06:25:00.0000] <annevk>
according to the bug "These properties are respectively the left offset and top offset relative to the viewport borders."

[06:25:01.0000] <annevk>
that sounds somewhat wrong terminology wise, but I guess you get the idea

[06:25:02.0000] <Huvet>
have anyone had any success with sending the lxml tree from html5lib to lxml.html.clean.Cleaner?

[06:26:00.0000] <Huvet>
I get a crash that _Element is missing a rewrite_links method

[06:30:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Image.x = The X coordinate of the image within the client display area.

[06:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Huvet: That sounds like a difference between lxml.etree._Element and lxml.html.)Element or something

[06:31:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Have browsers nuked Image.vspace/hspace yet?

[06:31:02.0000] <annevk>
no :/

[06:32:00.0000] <annevk>
and othermaciej is advocating lots of more cruft I found out today!

[06:32:01.0000] <Huvet>
jgraham: Ah, I assumed that an lxml.etree was always the same... I'll have a look

[06:32:02.0000] <virtuelv>
properties found in my ancient Wrox reference: 

[06:32:03.0000] <virtuelv>
 border, complete, constructor, defaultValue, height, hspace, lowsrc, name, size, src, vspace, width, x, y

[06:32:04.0000] <virtuelv>
and select()

[06:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: Im not familiar with <img>.x/y, if you would like I can search through history and see if I can find why it was added

[06:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: what cruft am I advocating?

[06:33:02.0000] <virtuelv>
<img>.x was first added in Netscape 3

[06:33:03.0000] <annevk>
just the bugs you filed on even more interfaces for legacy elements :)

[06:35:00.0000] <annevk>
like  HTMLAnchorElement.text

[06:35:01.0000] <virtuelv>
<a>. accessKey, dataFld, dataSrc, hash, host, hostname, href, Methods, mimeType, nameProp, pathname, port, protocol, protocolLong, rel, search, tabIndex, target

[06:35:02.0000] <annevk>
hmm, doesn't IE have a .text attribute for all elements?

[06:35:03.0000] <virtuelv>
dataFld/Src?

[06:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
virtuelv: They're a sort of client-side templating thing in IE (and in the HTML4 DTD)

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Fortunately approximately nobody uses that feature

[06:39:00.0000] <virtuelv>
some data binding thing, according to MSDN

[06:40:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I wonder if there's other, long-forgotten stuff this reference lists

[06:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I think I found one site that used the feature for real (to generate a list of cars from an XML data source), out of about half a million pages)

[06:41:01.0000] <virtuelv>
IMG.fileModifiedDate (Property)

[06:42:00.0000] <virtuelv>
iccProfile, fileSize, start

[06:43:00.0000] <virtuelv>
loop and dynSrc as well

[07:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan: fyi, initial attempt at <script src=""></script> checking is live on qa-dev

[07:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: cool

[07:57:00.0000] <zcorpan>
MikeSmith: seems to work from quick testing

[08:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, why does the complete version of the spec still have a version number in its title "Web Applications 1.0", given that the other version is now just called "WHATWG HTML" without a specific version?

[08:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
why is it "WHATWG HTML" instead of just "HTML"?

[08:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think that's just to help distingish it from the subset of HTML currently being developed in W3C. Though, I don't feel strongly either way about it.

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
How does replacing the boolean autobuffer attribute with a new enumerated attribute that has two values help with the problem of how browsers will react to new values they haven't heard of before?

[08:51:00.0000] <workmad3>
Philip`: allows them to die a bit more gracefully? :)

[08:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Is it just that having new values defaulting to don't-buffer is better than defaulting to do-buffer? Doesn't that depend on what the new values are going to be, which we don't know yet?)

[08:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
workmad3: I'm not sure I'd ever consider death to be graceful

[08:52:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I assume defaulting to more conservative behaviour is better

[08:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
(iundependent of what the less conservative options are)

[08:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: i.e. defaulting to behaviour that harms the typical user experience by not buffering and delaying their enjoyment when they want to watch the video?

[08:53:02.0000] <workmad3>
I'd figure it makes it easier to expand future versions in a backwards compatible manner though

[08:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Seems like neither option is really "better", they all have drawbacks and people could complain either way

[08:54:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I think lots of flash0using sites already do no autobuffering so it can't be that bad for user experience

[08:54:02.0000] <workmad3>
adding a new value to the values available is less disruptive than changing the attribute to an enumeration and also adding a new value

[08:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/0/-/

[08:56:00.0000] <workmad3>
imagine the complaints if the standard changed from 'autobuffer="autobuffer" ' enabling autobuffering to that being a non-valid value and therefore disabling it

[08:56:01.0000] <workmad3>
so betting that the attribute starts off with 'autobuffer="on" ' to enable it and never needing to change :)

[08:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
workmad3: I'm imagining the complaints and I can't really see them being that bad

[08:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
You simply make <video autobuffer> spec-wise identical to <video>

[08:57:02.0000] <workmad3>
true... not as bad as if it were the other way around

[08:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
and then people who really want autobuffering in FF3.5 just add the invalid attribute (in addition to the new attribute for other UAs)

[08:59:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, people are complaining about mozillaquestquest.com to me

[09:27:00.0000] <annevk>
foolip, if we have a new attribute that might support multiple states going forward but is currently just a flag there does not seem to be a need for more than one value

[09:28:00.0000] <annevk>
(the other value is simply omitting the attribute)

[09:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Crap, maybe I shouldn't have gotten a computer upgrade.  Now my dropdown menus are smooth as silk.  At least before I could be reasonably assured that my customers had a computer equal to or better than mine, and so would have an equal or better experience.

[10:53:00.0000] <ehird>
which is correct: <article>...<section class="comments">...</section></article> or <article>...</article><section class="comments">...</section>?

[10:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
ehird, "For instance, a blog entry on a site that accepts user-submitted comments could represent the comments as article elements nested within the article element for the blog entry."

[10:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#the-article-element

[10:56:02.0000] <ehird>
OK. Just seemed weird to consider comments part of the article itself, to me.

[10:56:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
So the way the spec suggests is <article>...text of article... <article>comment 1</article> <article>comment 2</article>...</article>

[10:56:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The idea is to suggest that they're related to it, I guess.

[10:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It does seem awkward for CSS.

[15:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know anything about nested iframes andonbeforeunloads?

[15:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[15:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
"and onbeforeunload?"

[15:45:00.0000] <cardona507>
dylan meets html5 - sheesh :-/


2010-01-06
[16:02:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: are you asking about what should happen, or what is happening with the onbeforeunloads?

[16:03:00.0000] <virtuelv>
(in other words, I think I am advocating the Useneticism "Just ask the question instead of asking about asking"

[16:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was hoping someone might tell me what teh spec should say :-)

[16:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems that onbeforeunload doesn't fire in nested iframes if you navigate the parent

[16:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
eeenteresting

[16:09:02.0000] <nessy>
Hixie, you are a stirrer - I had a good laugh at your email reply to Paul :-)

[16:09:03.0000] <Hixie>

Hixie: I know

[16:11:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I however don't know if I can be arsed to reconfigure my entire network

[16:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me just had to change the dhcp server

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, gecko does run the nested onbeforeunloads

[16:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me fires up virtualbox to see what IE does, since that now becomes the tie breaker

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
aww, IE and gecko agree, nested iframes fire onbeforeunload

[16:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
and they agree that it is breadth first, interesting

[16:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
wait, no

[16:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
IE is inconssitent

[16:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
gah, Gecko is consistent with the inconsistent

[16:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
wtf

[16:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok maybe i just misinterpreted the first result

[16:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok depth first

[16:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
i can do that

[17:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok so what happens if the page has an onbeforeunload that adds a child browsing context with an onbeforeunload...

[17:08:00.0000] <Hixie>

http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/navigation/beforeunload/004.html

[17:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
what's the right behaviour?

[17:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
(the question being, is onbeforeunload fired for browsing contexts created during onbeforeunload? how about if they are created and inserted before browsing contexts that have already fired onbeforeunload?)

[17:19:00.0000] <ap>
Hixie: fwiw, https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19418

thanks ap

Firefox could this, firefox could that. We _could_ all jump off a cliff too...

[18:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey, a tab

[18:33:00.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - are the WHATWG spec and the W3C spec still textually the same? or is <device> etc the differece now? I am wondering because I like to link people to the whatwg spec and I am wondering how different it is than the W3C spec. 

[18:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
the whatwg equivalent of the w3c htmlwg spec is http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/html5/

[18:35:01.0000] <cardona507>
awesome - thanks

[18:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
np

[18:36:00.0000] <cardona507>
<device> is pretty exciting by the way

[18:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
the faq has a (worryingly long) explanation of the various versions of the spec, btw

[18:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
in case you're interested

[18:43:00.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - is the idea with <device> etc and current work (including HTML5) to finally shift out of versions (4, 5, etc...) and into a fluid HTMLCurrent?

[18:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[18:43:02.0000] <cardona507>
ncie

[18:43:03.0000] <cardona507>
*nice

[18:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
see http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-December/024477.html

[18:46:00.0000] <cardona507>
wow - thats a pretty big deal

[18:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
few people noticed :-)

[18:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
the few that did complained that i was trying to take over html from the w3c or something

[18:47:02.0000] <cardona507>
:) classic

[18:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
(not sure how that works since all the text is also being done in public-html and public-device-apis at the w3c, but anyway)

[18:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i'm never gonna hit 100 bugs today at this rate

[18:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i just spent 5 hours on one bug

[18:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
it was a !@#%^$#&%$* hard bug, but that's besides the point...

[18:52:03.0000] <cardona507>
Another 495 hours and you can be done for today. :) what is the context of <device> - and who will likely implement it? could it be for a skype like service on chrome os?Are there any nightly builds that support it?

[19:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: it's exploratory for now, being discussed on public-device-apis⊙wo

[19:30:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
hello there 

[19:30:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
in regards to html5 coming from xhtml

[19:31:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i read in xhtml they put a trailing slash becuase of compatibility issues with some browsers

[19:31:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
and i read that in html5 you dont need it

[19:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
like in <br> or <img>?

[19:31:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
but it wouldnt be an issue if br hr meta still use it?

[19:31:04.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
yeah <br /> <hr /> yeah <img />

[19:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
html5 lets you do it either like html4 or like xhtml, so you can do <br> or <br/>, doesn't matter

[19:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
(the / is ignored)

[19:32:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
cause i just converted www.truecarnage.org 

[19:32:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
it wasnt that much of a change but i kinda want to cater to both

[19:32:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
is that possible?

[19:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
both what?

[19:32:05.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
to do html5 and yet keep to standards im used to in xhtml?

[19:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes, you can do that, HTML5 allows you to include the /

[19:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
in HTML5 you can do <br/> and it is valid

[19:33:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
how much of html5 is usable now?

[19:33:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
browser compatibility?

[19:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
pretty much all the stuff that was already in html4, as well as many other parts

[19:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are guides on the web that discuss that in more detail

[19:34:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
you guys deprecating <dv>?

[19:34:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
<div>

[19:35:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
<section> <aside> i read some stuff on that I will definitely read more on it 

[19:35:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
do you guys have icons for passing validation? 

[19:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
<div> isn't deprecated, it should be used when you need something to hook some styles on

[19:36:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
why did xhtml force transitional for <iframe> and target="_blank"

[19:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
no icons for passing validation, but we do have a validator at html5.validator.nu

[19:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
dunno, that was another working group

[19:36:04.0000] <Hixie>
html5 doesn't have a transitional anymore

[19:36:05.0000] <Hixie>
and it allows <iframe> and target=""

[19:36:06.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
nice cause i like to use _blank and it would fail me on strict

[19:37:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i read w3c has accepted html5 

[19:37:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
and its still ok to specify the types of script and styles?

[19:38:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
<script type="text/javascript">?

[19:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
you can, don't need to though

[19:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
<script> is fine

[19:38:03.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - will being a member of the HTMLwg help me get into the device api wg?

[19:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: as far as i know it's just a mailing list, unless you want to call into the meetings (but i don't bother with that)

[19:39:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
html5 is separate so there won't be a worry about bias towards browsers?

[19:40:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
that would be the browser issue?

[19:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean?

[19:40:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
thats one huge reason i used xhtml

[19:40:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
is that it tried to be ocmpatible

[19:40:04.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
across browsers and devices

[19:40:05.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i wouldnt want to work with a language that favors IE or Safari or chrome

[19:40:06.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
over another 

[19:40:07.0000] <Hixie>
html5 is significantly more compatible with browsers and devices than either XHTML or HTML4 ever were

[19:41:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
cool so it wont be driven by browser its its own 

[19:42:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
one thing i notice in internet explorer 8, many sites have javascript errors

[19:42:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
big sites

[19:43:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
espn, even id's quakelive, fancast

[19:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
that might have more to do with IE8 having bugs rather than the sites

[19:43:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i was wondering

[19:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
IE8 doesn't do javascript (or rather, the DOM) in a very standards-compliant way

[19:43:04.0000] <Hixie>
see e.g. how it does on acid3, which mostly tests DOM/JS stuff

[19:44:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
how far are we from css3?

[19:44:01.0000] <webben>
Is it correct to say there is no subset of valid HTML5 documents that would also validate as HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0?

[19:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
no

[19:44:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
www.truecarnage.org does

[19:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
webben: there are two HTML4 and XHTML1 DOCTYPEs that will validate as HTML5 (with a warning)

[19:45:00.0000] <webben>
ah okay

[19:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
smq-monstros1ty: css3 is a large number of specs, and i don't know how they are progressing, i'm out of touch with the css stuff these days

[19:46:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
thats cool apreciate your prompt replies to the questions :)

[19:46:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i just worry about compatibility and proprietary stuff

[19:46:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
since i dont make money and am not a business hehee

[19:46:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
yet wanting to have viewable content on all browsers

[19:47:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
I will read more i read a bit a while ago on <sectin> <aside> elements and the dictionary lists

[19:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[19:47:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
im happy <iframe> are still in heheh i like to use iframe and name attribute so people can click a link and have it work in the inline frame

[19:49:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
need to find a way to unify servers on irc heheh 

[19:49:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
thats a diff topic though i guess but 

[19:49:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i often have the issue of being on another network on irc hehehe

[19:51:00.0000] <Hixie>

[20:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't quite worked out what the example will be yet

[20:53:00.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - what do you have in mind?

[20:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
not sure yet, hold on

[20:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
something like a mail client's To: line with autocomplete coming from both a list="" and the native user contacts database

[20:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
and a second showing just using the native user contacts database

[20:58:00.0000] <cardona507>
I'm a little unclear - what do you mean 'autocomplete coming from both a list="" and the native user contacts database'? 

[20:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
hold on, i'm writing up the example so it'll be clearer

[20:58:02.0000] <cardona507>
ok

[21:03:00.0000] <Hixie>

looking through this reference--->  http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_article.asp

[21:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
i wouldn't recommend using w3schools

[21:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
they have a lot of mistakes

[21:16:05.0000] <Hixie>
(i don't know if they do in that particular article)

[21:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i just mean in general)

[21:17:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
is there an equivalent reference taglist for html5?

[21:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
there are some being made, or you can use the spec itself :-)

[21:17:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i often want to use an inline-block

[21:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
the spec has a radio button at the top that lets you turn off the implementation-specific stuff

[21:27:02.0000] <cardona507>
I was a little unclear what the |v were in the top line

[21:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow that's nearly perfect except for the |v bit

[21:28:01.0000] <cardona507>
ooops - the a on the far right of the top line will be a v

[21:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
the |v bit was supposed to be a drop-down arrow like in a combo box

[21:28:03.0000] <cardona507>
heh - yeah fixin it now

[21:30:00.0000] <cardona507>
like a small circle with a downward arrow in it?

[21:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[21:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not especially needed

[21:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
do whatever you think looks best :-)

Hixie - and you would also like a screenshot of the example below that one with bob@example? - removing line next to arrow

[21:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes please, if you can!

[21:42:00.0000] <cardona507>
no problem - here is example #1 final - http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/7262/example1final01.png - should I email it or will you just grab it off of your screen?

[21:49:00.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - and here is example #2 - http://img527.imageshack.us/img527/9046/ex201.png - let me know if you need any changes or if you need them emailed.

[21:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: i'll grab it from the site, thanks so much!

[21:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
those are really sweet

[21:56:00.0000] <cardona507>
thanks man

[21:56:01.0000] <cardona507>
glad to help

[21:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
are you in the acknowledgements yet?

[21:58:00.0000] <cardona507>
I don't think so - 

[21:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
dude, let me add you

[21:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
what's your full name?

[21:58:03.0000] <cardona507>
sweetness! :)  Carlos Gabriel Cardona

[22:06:00.0000] <cardona507>
Thanks Ian - I really appreciate it

[22:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: thank _you_!

[22:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a symbiotic relationship

[22:21:00.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - I just noticed that in the examples - On the first on arthur is before adam and on the second example arthur is after adam - would you like me to fix that? or am I over thinking it?

[22:22:00.0000] <cardona507>
*on the first one arthur...

[23:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
waiting for www-data's lock in /sources/public/html5/spec again

[00:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
i need a sanity check

[00:00:01.0000] <cedricv>
hey guys! is there any current work going on wrt the "notifications API" that has been removed (recently?) ?

[00:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
when someone refers to http://example.com/#foo, where http://example.com/ has no script and no element with id=foo, clearly something is wrong

[00:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
but if there's a script, #foo could be an argument to that script representing state

[00:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
is there some way to distinguish the two in a way that's useful in a validator?

[00:00:05.0000] <cedricv>
and by that question, i'm asking where, if any work is actually going on about this :D

[00:00:06.0000] <Hixie>
cedricv: not that i know of, though i think the chrome guys are still working on it -- #chromium might be able to help

[00:01:00.0000] <cedricv>
thanks Hixie, i'll poke them

[00:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
np

[00:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you don't know if the page is going to be loaded in an iframe that's going to get stuff injected to it by parent

[00:01:03.0000] <hsivonen>
stuff being script

[00:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[00:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
would a non-machine-checkable conformance requirement be in any way useful here? i guess not

[00:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
also, I'm not keen on making the validity of a document (that contains links) dependent on what the links deference to

[00:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so I'd prefer not having that as a conformance req

[00:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd be OK with a non-validation link checker feature whining about that case, though

[00:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
k, thanks hsivonen 

[00:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
is anyone working on webidl these days?

[00:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Does the Android browser / Mobile Safari have a way to use the interaction feature of next app view sliding in from the right?

[00:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in Web apps, that is

[00:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
seems like a new challenge to CSS

[00:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
sort of paginated view

[00:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
does that need anything more than mouse events and css transitions?

[00:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
with swipes between pages

[00:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh you mean between separate pages

[00:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
not an app simulating this

[00:16:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I mean within an app

[00:16:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: however implemented

[00:16:07.0000] <Hixie>
well just within an app seems easy enough, just detect the swipe and move the content

[00:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
why would it be hard

[00:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: though it would be nice for it to be Webby in terms of navigation and styling

[00:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
(haha famous last words)

[00:17:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is there a way to turn off zooming and to occupy the view port exactly?

[00:17:04.0000] <hsivonen>
doesn't seem quite media and device-independent...

[00:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(it's quite annoying that in Firefox Mobile, the default viewing model works for typical big site table layouts but sucks big time on single-column stretchy pages like #whatwg logs)

[00:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
CSS was supposed to address all this, but when the future came, the future was zooming desktop screen media instead of using a different layout

[00:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or then iPhone-specific pages

[00:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
:-(

[00:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me guesses the iPhone screen size and orientation is going to become incredibly sticky for years to come

[00:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
you can include iphone-safari flags on the iphone

[00:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
dunno about android

[00:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so either WGs working ahead of implementations lacked the right foresight or the Mobile Safari team suffered from NIH

[00:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(my bet is on the former explanation)

[00:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
or both

[00:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
the mobile safari team was operating in stealth mode, which made getting wg help hard

[00:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
that, too

[00:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
and as opera has shown, media queries aren't as great in practice as one might hope

[00:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what Opera has shown, I think, is mainly that it's better to default to zooming a desktopish layout than to reformat the page

[00:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
which is a nail in the coffin of semantic markup and device-independence

[00:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
because Opera actually tried it the theoretically right way first

[00:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[00:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, I should go file a bug about putting the max-width hack used by the Nokia S60 browser, Mobile Safari and Opera Mobile/Mini into Firefox Mobile, too, to make IRC logs suck less

[00:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: yt?

[00:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me keeps seeing people use hidden="" to hide things from display and not to make them irrelevant

[00:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. people use hidden="" to hide things while keeping them in microdata, or to refer to them from ARIA attributes

[00:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe we should rename it back

[01:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: dude, your bug reports are vague. :-P http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8374

[01:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: what's vague about it? there's an "act as if" in there, and that's guaranteed to emit an error

[01:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
"there"?

[01:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
where!

[01:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
the spec has like 15 different places that imply a "select" end tag

[01:05:04.0000] <hsivonen>
oops :-)

[01:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[01:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok my head just exploded trying to read a parser bug

[01:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
clearly it's time for me to take a break

[01:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
(http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8375)

[01:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
only 18 to go tonight

[01:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: did your head explode at the bug report or at trying to figure out how/if to fix?

[01:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
it failed to parse the description of the problem :-)

[01:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
so actually fixing it is clearly out of the question right now :-)

[01:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I suck at writing spec bugs

[01:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me loads up his Yes, Minister episodes that he bought yesterday

[01:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: oh i don't think it was your fault!

[01:11:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: here now

[01:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: i figured it out

[01:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
afk

[01:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so, my bug report sucks

[01:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders how I ended up filing it like that

[01:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like I mentally or concretely inlined an "as if" piece and then complained about a bad "(fragment case)" assertion that resulted from the inlining

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I commented on the bug

[01:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me thanks the chairs for holding a straw poll on microdata during the holiday period, while I was away and not monitoring e-mail much, and thus didn't know about it till now.

[01:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh well, I suppose it doesn't matter that much as it's non-binding and my position is already fairly well known

[01:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: when did your holiday period start?

[01:25:02.0000] <annevk>
and someone will always be away...

[01:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
around 6 December

[01:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Clearly the group should avoid making any decisions while Lachy is away

[01:28:01.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, holiday season starts around december 24...

[01:29:00.0000] <annevk>
(if there is any at all)

[01:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: dude, you have long holidays even by Nordic standards

[01:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, maybe for you northern hemisphere people who are used to taking long holidays during the middle of the year. But for southern hemisphere, December/January is the major holiday period

[01:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, my holiday was about 3 weeks long

[01:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
though, admittedly, it did start a little earlier than usual cause I had to get to Aus for my sister's wedding

[01:36:00.0000] <annevk>
anyway, my point is that you can't expect an entire WG to plan around you

[01:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
no, that's not what I'm saying.

[01:37:00.0000] <annevk>
jaja

[01:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm saying that mid-to-late december, through to about mid-January is a common holiday period for a lot of people, and should generally be avoided for significant things

[01:43:00.0000] <annevk>
a lot?

[01:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, yes. School holidays start around mid-to-late December in Australia, and end around the end of January. I'm sure it's the same in other southern countries too, so that would equal a lot

[01:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
other people tend to take time of work around the same time too, which is why it's considered a peak holiday season

[01:49:01.0000] <annevk>
"So Microsoft would not object to us changing the behaviour of onhashchange="" or the semantics of postMessage() to be incompatible with what was implemented in IE8?"

[01:49:02.0000] <annevk>
lol

[01:49:03.0000] <annevk>
Lachy, there's not a lot of people there in general

[01:49:04.0000] <hsivonen>
localStorage FTW!

[01:49:05.0000] <annevk>
heh

[01:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
annevk, just because it's most likely fewer people than there are in the northern hemisphere, doesn't mean it's not a lot

[01:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders when Hixie made the value attribute on meter a required attribute

[01:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, arguing with you about this seems pointless

[01:58:00.0000] <annevk>
even if it is a holiday period for a lot of people (depends on value of "a lot" I suppose), it certainly is not for a lot of people in the HTML WG

[01:58:01.0000] <annevk>
I'm going on vacation too this Friday for a couple of weeks but I don't really expect that nothing will happen in that time

[02:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: without looking at any logs, my guess is yesterday or the day before

[02:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: ah, OK

[02:01:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I had thought it had happened a long time ago and I somehow missed

[02:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me checks his commit-watchers mail

[02:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Giving the difficulty of getting anything decided at all in the HTML WG, I'm probably not a fan of the idea of delaying everything for a month-long period

[02:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it wasn't a straw poll

[02:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it was a request for arguments that hadn't been given yet (so why there were any left baffles me, given how long the issue had been open for)

[02:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: and they still haven't announced the result, so if you have a convincing argument, you can still let them know :-)

[02:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so that same commit also seems to remove all document-conformance requirements on the text content of meter and value

[02:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: which is great

[02:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: is it worth keeping the existing v.nu progress/meter text-content checking code, but emitting warnings instead of errors (with some tweaks to the contents of the existing message)?

[02:10:01.0000] <annevk>
somewhat annoying that some people just seem to ignore half the questions addressed at them and move on...

[02:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: let's just get rid of the code

[02:11:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[02:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yank the <time> element text-content checking as well?

[02:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: did Hixie remove that, too, from the spec?

[02:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: there don't seem to any longer be any document-conformance requirements on <time> text content in the spec

[02:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok. let's get rid of that code as well

[02:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[02:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: btw, about coding style, I seem to remember a while back you said 2 spaces for indents, rather that 4 spaces

[02:22:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or was it the other way around?

[02:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: i'm getting a lot of waiting for www-data's lock in /sources/public/html5/spec tonight

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
<time> still has text-content rules

[02:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
search for "If the element needs a date"

[02:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: 2 spaces in Jing, 4 spaces elsewhere in .java

[02:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like a bunch of my checkins failed to get the right diff lines

[02:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
i fixed the problem, but we may have to go through some of the recent changes and add them manually

[02:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
(the logs list the bug # and the revisions, so it shouldn't be difficult)

[02:33:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me tries to export Eclipse formatter settings

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: are you using Eclipse?

[02:34:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, I'll look into the XHR hook later

[02:35:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, why does WebSocket not need to use it or EventSource?

[02:35:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, or Web Workers?

[02:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
i just hardcoded websocket into the html5 spec

[02:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
i should add eventsource too

[02:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
i think web workers just works (via garbage collection)

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/eclipse-code-style.zip

[02:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: thanks

[02:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: yeah, I am using Eclipse

[02:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
headless Eclipse, with vim (eclim) as the editing frontend rather than the built-in one

[02:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: sounds like an interesting beast

[02:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I just discovered it recently. It seems quite well done. Makes all the Eclipse completions work in vim, takes all errors and warnings from Eclipse and lets you walk through them in vim and fix them

[02:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if you use vim, it's definitely worth taking a look at

[02:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: thanks, I missed that part about authoring requirements on time with no datetime attribute

[02:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I have been getting those waiting for www-data's lock messages lately too

[02:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think something may have changed in my server environment

[02:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: how do you want me to resolve http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8476 ?

[02:58:00.0000] <annevk>
i was kind of hoping you'd figure that out...

[02:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[02:59:00.0000] <annevk>
well ideally all the same i guess

[02:59:01.0000] <annevk>
but if the webgl guys really find that unacceptable we need a way to do something like their spec suggests

[02:59:02.0000] <annevk>
which is that if you ask for another context the existing one gets detached or some such

[02:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
can i volunteer you to discuss this with the webgl guys? i don't know who the webgl guys are

[02:59:04.0000] <annevk>
would be better if the hooks for that were in the base spec

[02:59:05.0000] <Hixie>
do they have an open list yet?

[02:59:06.0000] <annevk>
yes, but i haven't subscribed

[03:00:00.0000] <annevk>
and i'm not at all interested in this

[03:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
join the club :-)

[03:00:02.0000] <annevk>
well, enough to find the issue :)

[03:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
you raised it, your problem :-P

[03:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
no? :-)

[03:00:05.0000] <Hixie>
oh i know how to fix it

[03:01:00.0000] <annevk>
cool

[03:01:01.0000] <annevk>
/me has to go somewhere

[03:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
wait this is already clear

[03:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's one bitmap according to the spec

[03:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me doubts treating canvas as one bitmap for both the WebGL and 2D contexts is going to fly

[03:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's some currently-active discussion on the WebGL list about the context stuff

[03:07:00.0000] <annevk>
aah, let Philip` coordinate!

[03:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Implementors don't want to share a bitmap between 2D and WebGL contexts, because it forces performance penalties in current hardware/APIs

[03:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: ok, please file a bug when you can tell me precisely what the spec should say :-)

[03:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
so the HTML spec itself is clear but it's incompatible with what the WebGL spec requires

[03:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
how does WebGL handle page zooming?

[03:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me is kind of hoping the WebGL people will work out what to do

[03:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: As far as I'm aware (which isn't far since I've never tested it at all), they'd render into a width*height-attribute sized buffer and then stretch it to match CSS and zoom etc

[03:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
since I don't see what else they could reasonably do

[03:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, is your system clock set to the wrong day? This e-mail of yours was sent yesterday, but dated today. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/0123.html

[03:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: can OpenGL ES read back the buffer at the time of zooming, or will everything be kept in a buffer in case the user zooms later?

[03:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, for both 2D and 3D, it seems super-sad to me that Canvas is concuptually a bitmap instead of being a one-way resolution-independent drawing pipeline

[03:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me often runs with non-1:1 zoom

[03:14:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me doesn't want jaggies

[03:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i tried my best to make it the latter

[03:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It's defined in terms of writing to a fixed-size drawing buffer, and glReadPixels reads back from that buffer, and the buffer is passed to "the HTML page compositor immediately before a compositing operation" (where it might be transformed and drawn on top of, etc)

[03:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes the ability to read pixels back from canvases, because otherwise it'd be impossible to do pretty much everything he's ever done with it

[03:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: does glReadPixels kill perf?

[03:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Its existence doesn't hurt the performance of any other drawing operations

[03:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
but it's a bit slow if you call it

[03:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me has no idea how GL context virtualization in Quartz Compositor and the like works

[03:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me neither

[03:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: doesn't a readback always stall the GPU pipeline for the duration of the readback?

[03:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
(though I don't even know what it is)

[03:22:03.0000] <hsivonen>
or is a readback async?

[03:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's synchronous at the OpenGL API level

[03:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
so the drivers/hardware would have to flush all current drawing calls and then read all the pixels before carrying on, I presume

[03:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: as I understand it, Quartz window compositing is done on top of GL, but you can pretend the GL context inside your window is the whole GL world

[03:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
or something like that

[03:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
without really knowing much about this, it seems that a one-way operation for transferring the pixels onto a texture within the GPU would be a useful operation

[03:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
assuming you could queue subsequent ops with the texture into the pipeline right away

[03:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can select a texture as the framebuffer object, so that things are rendered directly onto that texture

[03:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/glFramebufferTexture2D.xml

[03:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: does using that result in the same black-box-testable effects as reading back the pixels? 

[03:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(assuming your CSS compositor allows a gl texture on a layer)

[03:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
You mean rendering onto the default framebuffer, then reading the pixels from the GPU back to the CPU, then doing the compositing on the CPU; vs rendering onto a new framebuffer that's bound to a texture, keeping it on the GPU, and doing the compositing on the GPU (assuming your GPU compositor is equivalent to the CPU-based one)?

[03:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: right

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Those should be equivalent as far as I'm aware, as long as your framebuffers are the same size and type in each case

[03:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hasn't used an GL features that weren't available way back when on an SGI O2

[03:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ok

[03:31:03.0000] <hsivonen>
s/an/any/

[03:31:04.0000] <hsivonen>
/me also hasn't used all features that were available back then

[03:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
It seems the problem with 2D/WebGL contexts is that browsers don't have a GPU-based compositor today, and they do 2D canvas on the CPU, but they want to support WebGL today, and they don't want to require a GPU/CPU synchronisation performance penalty

[03:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
It shouldn't be a problem in the future but they need a solution now

[03:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thought Safari on Snow Leopard had a GPU-based compositor

[03:33:03.0000] <Philip`>
(and preferably one that doesn't prevent a better solution in the future)

[03:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder if the non-sensical behavior of the Gecko HTML5 parser on http://fooo.fr/~vjeux/firefox/firefox_bug_fixing_a_tr.html is an implementation bug or a spec bug

[03:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
WebKit seems to handle it in a reasonable way

[04:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
ms2ger is damn incisive

[04:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
who is this guy

[04:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
he's been really helpful

[04:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
like, _really_ helpful

[04:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
wrote like the whole index and references sections

[04:01:05.0000] <Hixie>
filed a bunch of cunning bugs

[04:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
closed a bunch of invalid ones

[04:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, do you have a script that maintains those tables in the indexes automatically, or were they done manually? I could use those tables in the HTML5 Reference

[04:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
The elements one is especially useful. It's basically like the one I never got around to finishing my script for.

[04:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
actually, it's a little different from what I planned, but close enough

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
manually

[04:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
ms2ger did most of the work

[04:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. I must finish my scripts so they can be generated automatically for me the way I want them

[04:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you can get a script to generate what's in the spec today, that would be fantastic

[04:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
I need to check what the state of my scripts are, but I have some scripts that gather data from the spec and generate various tables of elements.

[04:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me 's usual conclusion from writing scripts to process the HTML5 spec is that the spec contains so many special cases that it's just as hard to write the script as to extract all the information by hand

[04:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
one of my scripts does basically read and store all of the information about elements in some data structures, so it shouldn't be too hard to modify it a bit to output the format needed.

[04:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
and you have the check the script output carefully by hand anyway, to make sure you didn't miss any special cases

[04:30:01.0000] <Lachy>
for the stuff I extract from the spec, it does seem fairly consistent. There are a few edge cases, but they seem to be detectable by the script itself and can be easily handled

[04:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
I also combine it with some data in a separate data file that is maintained by hand, like information about required/optional tags

[04:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
woo, i hit my target of 100 bugs open.

I just cant get my cache manifest working in firefox. It works excellent in safari, but Firefox never requests new versions of the cached files, even if the cache manifest is updated. The files specified in my cache manifest are all valid and exists. Are there any known issues with firefox? Something i have missed? How can this be debugged?

[07:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK to use Java5isms in v.nu code?

[07:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
e.g., for (String s : warnings) {...}

[07:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks for review, btw

[07:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
(going through your review comments now)

[08:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yes, Java5isms are OK and encouraged

[08:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK, thanks

[08:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: btw, I imported your formatters and, going forward, will run everything through that before committing

[08:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
also imported the cleanup stuff and templates

[08:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: about the year part of copyright line, should I change that to 2010, or should I add underneath a copy of the same line with the year as 2010, or change it to, e.g., Copyright (c) 2007-2010, or...?

[08:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to look how hsivonen has been doing it in htmlparser source

[08:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: nm

[08:39:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: I see you use ranges in htmlparser, so will change it to that

UTF-16 and null-terminated strings don't go well together.

That's hard with XML.

/me discovered recently that he can set his locale on Linux to use EBCDIC

[09:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
which makes all my filenames look much more interesting

[09:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
but I was disappointed that I couldn't set it to UTF-16

[10:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: http://html5lib.googlecode.com/hg/ doesn't have </title>

[10:36:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
can one use <section> instead of <div> now?  

[10:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
Not in all cases, since they have different semantics

[10:37:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
so section is more of a broad element?

[10:37:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
div more specific?

[10:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think (but could be wrong) that <section> should be used for a block that has a heading and that should appear in an outline of the document

[10:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me looks at the spec

[10:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
"Note: The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead. A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline."

[10:39:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
oh ok so a page could have <header></header><section></section><footer></footer>

[10:40:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
oh ok so put the divs inside so those would serve the purpose of a layout

[10:40:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
and <aside> too i imagine

[10:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
It could, although in that case I think you could just do <header>header</header>content<footer>footer</footer> and there's no need for <section> (though there would be a need if the content consisted of multiple sections)

[10:41:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
oh ok so i have one time or a few times had the need to have multiple pages

[10:41:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
like but have it vertical

[10:41:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
so a section could serve as a page

[10:41:03.0000] <Philip`>
If you're using <section>/etc then you should style those directly, rather than writing <section><div>... and styling the div

[10:41:04.0000] <Philip`>
but if you don't need the semantics of <section> then you should just use <div> by itself (or any more appropriate element)

[10:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
You might want <article> if the 'pages' are self-contained components

[10:43:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
yeah i was reading that too yeah and then use pdf and <data> element will leave teh text unchanged too?

[10:43:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i like the <video> tag and the <audio>

[10:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, what <data> element?

[10:43:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i have wanted to have an easy way to put a song on a page

[10:43:04.0000] <Philip`>
Also I'm not sure how PDF is relevant :-)

[10:43:05.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i might have mistyped it heheh

[10:43:06.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
well for a document

[10:44:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
that has many many pages

[10:44:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
probably berter to embed a pdf?

[10:44:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
say a document that has like 50 pages

[10:44:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
but you want it on the page viewable

[10:44:04.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
internet explorer doesnt support it lol but <audio> and <video> i surely will make use of

[10:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd usually prefer using HTML to PDF

[10:45:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
yeah 

[10:45:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
me too i read a tag that stated that the html wont modify it

[10:45:03.0000] <Philip`>
(except in cases where the exact layout is critical, or where it's intended for printing, in which case PDF is probably better)

[10:48:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
why did the align="center" get removed?

[10:48:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
<table align="center"> is quite convenient

[10:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Because CSS is recommended for presentational settings

[10:49:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
ah ok

[10:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
<style>table.whatever { margin: auto }</style> would center-align it in its container, I think

[10:49:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
nice

[10:50:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
thanks 

[10:50:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
back a while ago

[10:50:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
alt="" would make  a title over the img as well

[10:50:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
then it stopped working

[10:50:04.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
title="" i found it the other day

[10:50:05.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
sometimes its weird somethign small like that 

[10:50:06.0000] <Philip`>
alt only made tooltips in IE, not any other browser

[10:50:07.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
oh

[10:50:08.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
for a while i was using ie only

[10:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
then IE changed to be consistent with the others, by using title for tooltips

[10:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
and leaving alt for its proper purpose (alternative text for non-graphical browsers)

[10:51:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i like firefox and i like opera 

[10:51:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
yeah i always put in an alt in imgs now

[10:52:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
opera's widgets are cool the 2d ruler

[10:52:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
and the screenruler

[10:52:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if anyone has a made a real plastic ruler for measuring pixels (calibrated to common monitor DPIs)

[10:53:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
I need to read more on the em's

[10:54:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i understand someehwat on px to use but em is a bit vague for me

[10:54:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i understand it from emphasis concept

[10:54:02.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
but distancewise i 

[10:54:03.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
its basically the browser that needs to be compatible to use display:inline-block; right?

[10:55:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
often i would like to use an inline element as a block too

[10:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
inline-block should work in all modern browsers

[10:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
according to http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html

[10:57:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
interesting 

[10:57:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
its probably my error somewhere that made it not work then heheh

[10:59:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
nice thanks for the link

[10:59:01.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>
i find using outline: helpful when constructing a page

[11:01:00.0000] <smq-monstros1ty>

[13:33:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, did Tyler explain already how UM would work with <canvas> and <img>?

[13:34:00.0000] <annevk>
/me is confused now

[13:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: is this even relevant to discuss? UM could be useful even if it does not cover all the use cases of CORS

[13:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: so whether UM covers all useful use cases is only really a relevant question if someone argues to rescind CORS or fail to advance it

[13:42:00.0000] <annevk>
that's their position

[13:42:01.0000] <annevk>
so I think it's relevant to discuss

[13:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: would the correctness or wrongness of their position affect our willingness to publish the spec as FPWD?

[13:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or even to advance it to Last Call?

[13:49:00.0000] <annevk>
if we just want UM features we can do that easily with CORS already

[13:49:01.0000] <annevk>
by just passing an anon origin if the right flags are passed to XHR2

[13:49:02.0000] <annevk>
and setting the credentials flag to false

[13:50:00.0000] <annevk>
so if they're wrong we don't need UM as we can just put it on top XHR2/CORS with a paragraph of extra text or so

[13:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sure, CORS could define a UM mode by having suitable mode flags

[13:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(besides the credentials flag I guess it would need an origin flag)

[13:53:00.0000] <annevk>
that's already there

[13:53:01.0000] <annevk>
both are already there

[13:53:02.0000] <annevk>
all that's needed is a new constructor for xhr

[13:54:00.0000] <annevk>
which would override those flags

[13:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[13:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so UM is basically the no-credentials no-origin profile of CORS

[13:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(except that the current version does not do preflight either

[13:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
)

[13:56:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, preflight would automatically work with "CORS-UM"

[13:56:01.0000] <annevk>
I still don't really see how the UI and all will work for UM though

[13:56:02.0000] <annevk>
those threads are never really clarified

[13:57:00.0000] <annevk>
in other news, "BiDirectional or Server-Initiated HTTP" HTTP?!

[13:57:01.0000] <annevk>
at least the text is somewhat less misleading

[13:57:02.0000] <annevk>
although it does talk about HTTP clients...

[14:00:00.0000] <annevk>
also, I'm letting http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8476 be somebody else's problem

[14:00:01.0000] <annevk>
too much work

[14:00:02.0000] <annevk>
already

[14:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I expect the spec requirement doesn't work for WebGL

[14:03:00.0000] <annevk>
the  WebGL spec conflicts with the spec at the moment

[14:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have heard from our 3D folks that it's not really practical to do 3D and 2D drawing freely mixed into a shared bitmap

[14:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
although I am not sure what happens when you try to switch

[14:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll be happy to change teh spec to whatever the webgl guys think it should say

[14:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
whether that is that getContext('3d') should blow away the bitmap, or getContext() for anything should do so, or getContext() should switch to a different bitmap, or whatever

[14:26:00.0000] <annevk>
i guess you should just have a concept of a context that reserves the bitmap

[14:26:01.0000] <annevk>
other specs define whether they are such a context

[14:26:02.0000] <annevk>
lets call the context x

[14:27:00.0000] <annevk>
you have to worry about getContext(x) on something with a non-x context and about invoking non-x or different x on an already active x

[14:28:00.0000] <annevk>
in the latter case, should be able to attach the removed context again later somehow?

[14:28:01.0000] <annevk>
the object is still around...

[14:28:02.0000] <annevk>
actually, in both cases you have that

[14:28:03.0000] <annevk>
doh

[14:28:04.0000] <othermaciej>
should it be only on getContext(x), or if you save a context and use its methods does that also affect the bitmap?

[14:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
like if you save copies of 2d and webgl contexts, and alternately call methods from one or the other

[14:29:01.0000] <annevk>
it only affects if the context is "active" i believe

[14:29:02.0000] <annevk>
no idea what happens with the inactive one though

[14:30:00.0000] <annevk>
maybe they should throw INVALID_STATE_ERR

[14:30:01.0000] <annevk>
on anything

[14:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
so i'm all in favour of people agreeing with me, but in this instance i'm a little concerned that i might be part of some spammer's script: http://thestatbot.com/2009/01/17/the-entire-louis-gray-greader-leaderboard/#comment-28682654

[14:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
the comment that mentions my name comes after a bunch of clearly spammy comments, and is a complete non-sequitur

[14:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks like in fact it is copied straight from http://playtheweb.org/?p=124

[14:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh and the comment has a spammy name

[14:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's pretty funny

[14:33:00.0000] <annevk>
wasted 30s of my time!

(Current thread about getContext)

[14:33:03.0000] <annevk>
I remember that we can actually do 2d and 3d on the same context at some point

[14:34:00.0000] <annevk>
same bitmap

[14:34:01.0000] <annevk>
doh

[14:34:02.0000] <annevk>
I should ask Tim again

[14:34:03.0000] <annevk>
would definitely be vastly superior

[14:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know how to evaluate the claim that it's hard or can't be done

[14:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems like you could always render down to a bitmap when you switch

[14:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
seems to me like it could just be implemented as two bitmaps over each other

[14:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
if we wanted to just allow overlays

[14:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
or yeah, forcing a flattening when switching

[14:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
It seems hard to come up with useful semantics since the contexts have different buffer formats, e.g. 2D has RGBA but 3D has depth too

[14:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not especially worried about people wanting to use two contexts on one canvas though

[14:37:00.0000] <annevk>
3d for some graphics, 2d for some text oh well

[14:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure overlay is a logically expected semantic, given the non-retained-mode behavior of canvas

[14:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: [ms] is ms2ger

[14:38:01.0000] <annevk>
aah

[14:54:00.0000] <GPHemsley>
Does anyone know off-hand if IE6 supports @id anchors?

[14:55:00.0000] <annevk>
it does

[14:55:01.0000] <GPHemsley>
I thought so

[14:55:02.0000] <annevk>
IE5 does too

[14:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
is there an ETA on the microdata decision yet?

[14:56:00.0000] <annevk>
NN4 didn't

[14:56:01.0000] <annevk>
but I never cared about that

[14:56:02.0000] <GPHemsley>
:)

[14:56:03.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, it seems they reached a decision but are working on wording

[14:57:00.0000] <annevk>
"The Chairs met last week and today to discuss the results of the Microdata poll. We are formulating our response and will provide it to the WG ASAP."

[14:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
maciej: any ETA on the microdata decision's wording being published?

[14:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
er, othermaciej_ ^

[15:00:00.0000] <othermaciej_>
Hixie: no firm ETA but I am hoping for sometime this week

[15:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm getting close to having no bugs left for which i'm comfortable giving an editor's decision without hte microdata thing resolved

[15:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
so i might defer the remaining bugs to next week

[15:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it looks like there's still 100 open and most do not seem removal-related

[15:38:00.0000] <daedb>
If I do a CSS transition on background-color from #dfdfdf to #eee, why does the background become darker before it goes lighter?

[15:41:00.0000] <annevk>
browser bug?

[15:41:01.0000] <annevk>
did you try another browser?

[15:42:00.0000] <daedb>
It's the same in both Chrome and Opera 10.5...

[15:42:01.0000] <annevk>
not sure about Firefox, but Opera 10.5 should support it

[15:42:02.0000] <annevk>
oh

[15:42:03.0000] <annevk>
you're way ahead of me then :)

[15:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
daedb, have a minimal test case?

[15:44:00.0000] <daedb>
AryehGregor: I can make one.

[15:47:00.0000] <daedb>
hmmm, it doesn't do it when I make a minimal test... odd. I must've screwed up somewhere :-/

[15:49:00.0000] <daedb>
oh, it's because the background-color was inherited from the parent... 

[15:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
payman: Wow, it's tiny!

[15:51:00.0000] <annevk>
async IRC reactions FTW

[15:51:01.0000] <annevk>
or was it just wc?

[15:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Related to stuff he'd asked in private.

[15:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk, what does "What did you do? You tried to pass the comment system with an invalid comment! (Or you used an entity that cannot be used. Sorry about that, PHP is a mess.)" mean?  I have a comment I want to post but it won't let me.

[15:52:02.0000] <annevk>
ah, it might mean you used &amp; or so

[15:52:03.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: It means your comment was invalid

[15:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk, should I use numeric references instead, or what?

[15:53:01.0000] <annevk>
there's a bug somewhere in the system that I haven't caught, so I just worsened usability

[15:53:02.0000] <annevk>
just say AMP or something and I'll fix it

[15:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: We should get PHP html5lib to a state in which you can use it

[15:53:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
What?

[15:53:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, <3

[15:53:06.0000] <annevk>
replace &amp; with AMP

[15:53:07.0000] <daedb>
AryehGregor: http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/344

[15:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: Then you can just check for parse errors

[15:54:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[15:54:02.0000] <annevk>
or ignore them :)

[15:54:03.0000] <annevk>
though that might require some spam control

[15:54:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk, I'm not using &amp;, I'm using &lt; and &gt;.  Same principle?

[15:54:05.0000] <Philip`>
Why not use the Python html5lib, and call it with IPC from PHP?

[15:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems easier than making PHP html5lib work

[15:55:01.0000] <annevk>
AryehGregor, yes

[15:55:02.0000] <annevk>
AryehGregor, though &gt; is never needed

[15:55:03.0000] <annevk>
AryehGregor, just use the raw character there

[15:55:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It is in attributes in XML, right?

[15:55:05.0000] <annevk>
it's only the predefined entities

[15:55:06.0000] <annevk>
AryehGregor, oh yeah, though I've no idea why

[15:55:07.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: no

[15:55:08.0000] <annevk>
oh lol

[15:55:09.0000] <annevk>
XML5 allows it all :)

[15:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, no?

[15:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
 '"' ([^<&"] | Reference)* '"' 

[15:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
   |  "'" ([^<&'] | Reference)* "'"

[15:56:03.0000] <gsnedders>
That's AttValue

[15:56:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk, doesn't seem to have worked too well.  http://annevankesteren.nl/2010/01/optimizing-html#comment-6872

[15:56:05.0000] <annevk>
I said I'd fix it

[15:56:06.0000] <annevk>
that means manually

[15:56:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk, ah, I see.

[15:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, all I know is when I used > in attribute values, XML parsers started dying on me.

[15:58:00.0000] <annevk>
you're not using attributes...

[15:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The spec does seem to agree with you, though.

[15:58:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
annevk, no, it was a hypothetical point in the case of my blog post.

[15:58:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I stuck in &gt; to see if that would make your confusing error go away.

[15:59:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah it sucks

[15:59:01.0000] <annevk>
I should really invest some time in da blog

[15:59:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me would probably just nl2br(htmlspecialchars()) comments if he wrote his own hacky blog software

[15:59:03.0000] <annevk>
but it'll have to wait until February at the earliest

[15:59:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wouldn't use PHP ;P


2010-01-07
[16:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I have some thoughts about doing that, but it's kind of pointless unless I start writing more.

[16:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, me neither, I'd use Python.

[16:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know the Python names offhand, though.

[16:00:03.0000] <gsnedders>
me too.

[16:00:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
cgi.escape() or something?

[16:00:05.0000] <gsnedders>
I would just use a serializer, and not do that ;P

[16:00:06.0000] <Philip`>
I'd let people write arbitrary unfiltered HTML

[16:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doesn't know what a serializer is, is probably too corrupted by PHP's weakness

[16:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
Much more fun that way

[16:01:02.0000] <gsnedders>
"When you do XSS attacks, it's considered highly impolite to make the resulting markup invalid" â Philip Taylor

[16:01:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, maybe you should put in in <iframe sandbox>.  That will encourage people to upgrade to browsers that support that feature, if they want to read your blog.

[16:01:04.0000] <annevk>
if <iframe sandbox doc=> was there and a couple of browsers supported it...

[16:02:00.0000] <annevk>
would be neat

[16:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I should probably add more to http://gsnedders.com/php-grievances

[16:02:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, oh, you have a page on PHP grievances?  I've been meaning to write one too.

[16:02:03.0000] <Philip`>
There's still the problem of raising the minimum effort required to comment in order to stop spammers, so I'd probably forbid the letter 't'

[16:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Yeah, I wrote it in around an hour one day after spending a while hacking on PHP code

[16:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
My objections seem to mostly be different, though.

[16:03:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"((bool) '0' === false) is an endless source of bugs."

[16:03:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
YES.

[16:03:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
That is possibly my number one hated feature of PHP.

[16:03:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Also empty('0') === true

[16:03:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Same principle, yeah.

[16:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
if (!$userinput) { # guess user didn't input anything }

[16:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, oops, guess the user input a literal '0'.

[16:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
How many retarded MediaWiki bugs have been caused by that, ugh.

[16:04:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
"XYZ fails for a user named '0'."

[16:04:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
"XYZ fails on the page [[0]]."

[16:04:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has for SimplePie test cases for more or less everything being equal to '0'.

[16:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"XYZ fails when URL parameter W is equal to '0'."

[16:05:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Also !$userinput is bad anyway, what if it's not set? I don't want no stinkin' E_NOTICE!

[16:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Bugs reported to say this are bogus".  You should put that as a separate objection, bugs are always marked bogus.

[16:05:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, I'm assuming it's already known to be set.

[16:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, they mark everything bogus if they don't feel like fixing it right now.

[16:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: I had a fix for a thing committed today.

[16:06:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I assume they have some policy where people get bonuses based on how many bugs they close or something.

[16:06:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(Namely, UTF-16 was broken with DOMDocument::loadXML() because it was using null-terminated strings)

[16:06:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or policies about having only a certain number of bugs open.

[16:06:05.0000] <gsnedders>
(and the XML spec says UTF-16 MUST be supported)

[16:06:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Either that, or the PHP developers are just colossal morons.  That seems like a plausible hypothesis too.

[16:06:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, yeah, sometimes they randomly accept things.

[16:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, the email to internals for PHP 5 bugs wasn't sent for a while because it had over 1000 things in it, and that broke the script!

[16:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, did you know, for instance, that if a __get is nested at any depth inside another __get, even for a totally different class (IIRC), it silently returns null without even raising a notice?

[16:07:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Most of the bugs I've reported in the past couple of years aren't bogus.

[16:07:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
And they closed it bogus.

[16:07:04.0000] <gsnedders>
No, they aren't.

[16:07:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was continuing my last sentence.

[16:07:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway.

[16:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm sure they don't close *everything* bogus, but they close an unreasonable amount.

[16:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
There again, several were crashes. They fixed those.

[16:08:02.0000] <gsnedders>
In PHP 5.3 CVS, before 5.3 shipped!

[16:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The major problem with PHP is it's accreted, not designed.

[16:09:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Indeed.

[16:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Do you know that f(func_get_args()) returns an error?

[16:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or doesn't work, anyway?

[16:09:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah.

[16:09:05.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: And yes, I knew about __get.

[16:09:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why?  Because some PHP developer said "Eh, it's not worth writing extra code for such a corner case, I'll just throw an error."

[16:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because they don't start from a specification and implement it.  They just implement whatever they happen to feel like implementing at the time.

[16:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
PHP really sucks.

[16:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
There are no coherent principles anywhere in the language.

[16:10:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Ruby didn't start from a spec.

[16:10:04.0000] <gsnedders>
I think the reason why Python and Ruby have done so much better is a gate-keeper with a coherent idea for the language.

[16:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, Python does tend to spec things before implementing them, but I agree that's not strictly necessary if the people in charge are sane.

[16:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Right, Pthon does.

[16:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
That's why I said Ruby and not Python :)

[16:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyhow, I need to pack.

[16:11:04.0000] <annevk>
feeling productive in the AM

[16:12:00.0000] <annevk>

[16:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
I can't think of any successful modern languages that weren't accreted

[16:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, is Python not successful, not modern, or accreted?

[16:13:00.0000] <annevk>
Python libraries are somewhat of a mess

[16:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Being designed over a long period of time doesn't count as accretion in my books, either.  Java or C# or whatever were designed, not accreted.

[16:13:02.0000] <annevk>
though they fixed some of it in 3.0 it seems

[16:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm interpreting "accreted" as meaning the same as "evolved", and languages like Python and Java accreted with the guidance of some language design principles and a desire for self-consistency

[16:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The first versions were very different to the current versions - nobody sat down and wrote a complete spec for the current version before implementing any of it)

[16:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, what branch cut does Python use for complex exponentiation?  It looks like log(z) lies in (-pi, pi], I wonder if that's documented?

/me comes off the phone with t-mobile technical support wondering wtf just happened (blogged it in case anyone can explain)

[16:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
time to go to work i guess

[16:33:00.0000] <annevk>
sounds broken

[16:34:00.0000] <annevk>
you should be able to do most of that through their online store as well btw

[16:34:01.0000] <annevk>
at least that's how I got my contract with t-mobile in the Netherlands...

[16:35:00.0000] <annevk>
take two at going to bed...

/me suddenly interpreted that as two nymphs standing in a row for some reason

[16:35:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doesn't usually have NetHack flashbacks

[16:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: i did do it through their online store, it said there was a problem and i had to call them

[17:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Wait, you were on the phone!? :o

[17:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hah. Fun.

[17:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me sighs

I never knew wardrobes could be so painful to look inside. Oh well.

[18:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
and should <progress> and <meter> elements appear in form.elements?

[18:08:00.0000] <deltab>
do they have defaultValue?

[18:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
deltab: no

[18:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
deltab: though i guess they could

ok well lacking any reply, i'll go with no resetting and not in .elements

Imagine how much more accessible the @summary discussion would be if each post had a summary

[19:26:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me tries to imagine summary of summaries

[19:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, most posts would summarize to "I'm making argument X". The thread itself would be "People made arguments X, Y and Z"

[20:04:00.0000] <karlcow>
Dashiva: and everyone in the thread has tendency (and that's normal) to summarize (no pun) from his/her point of view or competences.

implementability, implementation landscape, practice, society constraints (for accessibility legal frameworks), etc. are different flavors of implementations

MikeSmithX: i'm stuck with  cvs.bin commit: [04:30:17] waiting for www-data's lock in /sources/public/html5/spec

[20:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
for like an hour now

[20:25:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Hixie: OK, I clearly need to turn off my script

[20:25:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
will do it right now

[20:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: does <output> have a defaultValue?

[20:52:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
Hixie: it turns out the problem is not my script, but some problem on the cvs server.. I'm trying to figure it out now, but not clear to me how locking is handled in this cvs server instance

[21:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithX: k

[21:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: nice

[21:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
sigh, we don't even have interop on window.atob()

[21:57:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
that's why we need a spec :)

[21:59:00.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - do you need any more graphic work for the spec? If so let me know - that was fun

[22:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: i'll keep that in mind :-)

[22:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: nothing springs to mind, but i'm sure we can find things

[22:00:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
cardona507: there's some ascii art in the spec currently i think

[22:01:00.0000] <cardona507>
zcorpan_ any idea which parts?

[22:02:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
6.8.2.2 Sample user interface

[22:05:00.0000] <cardona507>
firing up adobe illustrator......

[22:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan_: ooh, good call

[22:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: don't do the ascii art in the websockets section btw, that has to remain ascii art for the ietf

[22:15:00.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - but 6.8.2.2 sample user interface is cool?

[22:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[22:15:02.0000] <cardona507>
alrighty

[22:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to take artistic license too

[22:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
(e.g. let me know if i need to change the sample text around it to make it better fit whatever you come up with)

[22:17:00.0000] <cardona507>
ok - thanks

[22:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
wait, atob() is only in Gecko and Webkit!

[22:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
IE and Opera don't even support it

[22:25:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: you need a newer opera

[22:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
Opera stopped autoupdating for me

[22:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
it says something about how it downloaded it, but won't update

[22:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
because it's not feeling well, or can't be bothered, or something

[22:26:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
weird

[22:26:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
try http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/happy-new-year

[22:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
(and i can't find any ui anywhere to force an update)

[22:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
will that autoupdate?

[22:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i guess it should... but it's the latest build currently and it has atob if you want to test it

[22:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
since IE doesn't have it and since it really should be in the JS spec i punted on it

[22:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithX: (i'm skipping cvs commits for now, since it's still blocking)

[23:05:00.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie, zcorpan_ - feedback? http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/7346/whatwg68ex101.png

[23:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks fantastic

[23:07:00.0000] <cardona507>
thanks

[23:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
tis checked in :-)

[23:14:00.0000] <cardona507>
that was quick - the image isn't working for me in safari...

[23:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i had a typo, fixing it already :-)

[23:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: doesn't work in multipage

[23:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i accidentally killed the commit script before it called the multipage generator

[23:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
it'll be fixed when i do my next checkin

[23:32:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[23:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can't find any actual examples of <ms> use on the web (mathml element)

[23:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
i mean there are trivial examples, but nothing realistic

[23:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: there's another bit of ascii art in that section, btw, in case you're still looking for things to do :-)

[00:00:00.0000] <cardona507>
but of course :) - what section?

[00:00:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
cardona507: same section

[00:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
same one, search for "||||||||||||||||"

[00:01:01.0000] <cardona507>
oh yeah - I am finished with that one and uploading it for feeback right now -

[00:01:02.0000] <cardona507>
got any more?

[00:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
sweet

[00:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
let's see

[00:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you want to try making stuff up, you could try making up examples of what some of hte form controls could look like

[00:04:01.0000] <cardona507>
http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/2720/whatwg68ex201.png - is that how you thought the "no application selected" area would look? or will it be an input?

[00:04:02.0000] <Hixie>
like the date controls and stuff

[00:04:03.0000] <cardona507>
from what section Hixie?

[00:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
(though that's somewhat of a rat's nest of stuff)

[00:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
the <input> element and its subsections

[00:05:01.0000] <cardona507>
ahhh - ok I'll check it out -

[00:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
looks good to me

[00:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
let me just finish the edit i'm doing now and i'll put that one in too :-)

[00:06:02.0000] <cardona507>
cool - thanks ian

[00:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
don't thank me, you're the one doing the work :-)

[00:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
hmm, should i add <device> to html5-elements?

[00:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wouldn't yet

[00:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's not even in the whatwg html spec's index yet

[00:08:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
ok

[00:12:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
 /me notices a typo in html5-elements

[00:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, checking in the new image cardona507

[00:18:00.0000] <cardona507>
wow - 23 input types - sweet - much better than the old 7

[00:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
hehe

[00:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
some have some images already if you need some inspiration

[00:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, re your blog, what possessed you to finally give in and get yourself a phone?

[00:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not for me

[00:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[00:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was getting a sim for the nexus one that i'm giving my girlfriend

[00:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[00:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
to replace her horrific verizon phone

[00:24:00.0000] <cardona507>
how is the nexus one? android 2.0 is pretty HTML5 friendly isn't it?

[00:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
so, how come they wanted to charge you $70 for something that should have added up to $61.24?

[00:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: seems pretty good to me, but i haven't played with it much and i hate phones in general, so... :-)

[00:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
lachy: i honestly didn't understand most of the phone call

[00:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i have not much clue what i'm actually going to receive

[00:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
we'll see

[00:28:00.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - are they too super obvious for a graphic or do we need one for type="text" password etc? I don't mind creating them since they will be pretty simple

[00:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
personally i wouldn't bother with the simple ones

[00:28:02.0000] <cardona507>
ok

[00:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
but then personally i wouldn't bother with any of them because i'm lazy :-)

[00:29:01.0000] <cardona507>
ha

[00:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
my recommendation would be that you pick a few of the more interesting ones, and make some very different examples for them

[00:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
so e.g. type=range you could should a slider and a twisting knob thing

[00:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh another element that would be good to show examples of is <meter> -- you could show several different kinds of gauges

[00:30:01.0000] <cardona507>
good ideas

[00:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
whatever example images you come up with i can figure out some story around them to explain what the image is showing

[00:31:00.0000] <cardona507>
sounds good

[00:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to slide in some easter eggs btw -- a great many of the examples in the spec have secret messages or are referencing memes, or shows or books i like, or my friends, or whatever :-)

[00:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
gives the spec some levity

[00:33:00.0000] <cardona507>
hehe I will definitely take that advice- any examples that aren't too secret?

[00:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
search for "hedral"

[00:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
he's my cat :-)

[00:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
there's all kinds of examples with him in it

[00:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
you even made one :-P

[00:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
well the graphic you made didn't mention hedral, but it went with an example that did

[00:35:00.0000] <cardona507>
is he the inspiration from the validhtml5 button? hmmm - I didn't notice his name before 

[00:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
nah the validhtml5 button is Astrophy http://hixie.ch/resources/images/astrophy

[00:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
clearly, people who file bugs from the spec UI need more unique initials

[00:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
(not a real cat)

[00:37:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
maybe you can make a kettle with two gauges: one for amount of liquid and one for temperature

[00:38:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
dunno if an HTML kettle is useful for anything, but still

[00:38:01.0000] <cardona507>
ahhh I see now - from earlier -  <option value="hedral⊙dc">

[00:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: isn't http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=4532&to=4533 backwards-incompatible?

[00:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
with what?

[00:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
generic rel munging 

[00:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
probably doesn't matter for any concrete piece of software

[00:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
if there are any cases that this breaks, let me know and i'll fix it

[00:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
the change is needed to make rdfa not break

[01:05:00.0000] <payman>
gsnedders: i know!

[01:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
cardona507: Graphical examples of canvas features (e.g. line caps and joins, and radial gradients) might be handy :-)

[01:17:01.0000] <cardona507>
Philip` - good to know - that will be my next project :) 

[01:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: as soon as I get resolution on the lock problem, I'll let you know

[01:21:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
cardona507: http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas_sheet/HTML5_Canvas_Cheat_Sheet.png has some canvas examples

[01:21:01.0000] <cardona507>
thanks zcorpan_

[01:21:02.0000] <cardona507>
wow - nice link :)

[01:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think maybe bugs that look like total junk could be INVALID instead of NEEDSINFO (e.g. <http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8654>)

[01:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[01:34:00.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - how about this for a <input type="range"> between 100 and 700 http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/5747/whatwgrangeex101.png

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: i think i'd make that two examples -- the top one and the bottom one, separate, without the number field in the middle

[01:36:01.0000] <cardona507>
ok

[01:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: (in practice browsers likely would not make a type=range be that big)

[01:36:03.0000] <cardona507>
gotcha

[01:36:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
cardona507: looks like the thumb is 100 steps too far to the right

[01:36:05.0000] <cardona507>
yeah -hehe - I just noticed

[01:36:06.0000] <zcorpan_>
cardona507: or the current value should say 607 instead

[01:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: does the change for UAs to ignore charset in <style type="text/css; charset=xxx"> (r4520, bug 8556) not have any possible implications for conformance checkers?

[01:37:01.0000] <cardona507>
I am just gonna remove the value field and make it 2 examples

[01:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: i guess it would, yeah, didn't really think of that

[01:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
afk

[01:39:00.0000] <cardona507>
potential range #1 http://img262.imageshack.us/img262/5747/whatwgrangeex101.png

[01:40:00.0000] <cardona507>

[01:40:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
looks good

[01:40:02.0000] <cardona507>
thanks :)

[01:40:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
should #2 indicate current value somehow?

[01:41:00.0000] <cardona507>
sounds good to me - what do you have in mind?

[01:41:01.0000] <cardona507>
a little down arrow along the top and center?

[01:42:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
yeah, maybe

[01:42:01.0000] <cardona507>
ahhh - I know - 1sec

[01:43:00.0000] <tametick>
greetings 

[01:43:01.0000] <tametick>
how well supported is the audio api in current browsers? is it about comparable to canvas support?

[01:44:00.0000] <cardona507>
zcorpan_ http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/4175/whatwgrangeex20202.png better????

[01:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
tametick: canvas came earlier

[01:45:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
cardona507: ooh nice

[01:45:02.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - your opinion?

[01:46:00.0000] <tametick>
zcorpan_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_layout_engines_(HTML_5)#Elements -> seems to suggest that newer ff/chrome/safari/opera should support ogg & wav

[01:46:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
tametick: current opera has basic audio support based on old spec (before there was an <audio> element), only supporting wave pcm

[01:46:02.0000] <tametick>
hrm

[01:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: looks good, i'll add them in tomorrow (or later tonight if i'm up to it)

[01:47:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
tametick: opera 10.50 will have updated support (including ogg/vorbis)

[01:47:02.0000] <cardona507>
tametick - firefox - wav & ogg - safari - mp3  - chrome - wave and mp3 (not sure on chrome)

[01:47:03.0000] <cardona507>
Hixie - no rush of course - I was just wondering if you had any change suggestions

[01:47:04.0000] <tametick>
cardona507: well that sucks... so there is no format that is supported on all 3?

[01:47:05.0000] <othermaciej>
cardona507: I'm pretty sure Safari supports wav as well

[01:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
we support nearly every audio format that QuickTime supports

[01:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
cardona507: looks good to me

[01:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
gotta go, bbiab

[01:48:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so wav, mp3, AAC should all work

[01:49:00.0000] <tametick>
othermaciej: how about ogg?

[01:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
by default no, but if you install the Ogg codec for QuickTime it will work

[01:49:02.0000] <cardona507>
nope - you need to do <audio controls><source src=".wav"><source src=".ogg"></audio> - tametick

[01:49:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(most users don't have that though)

[01:49:04.0000] <hsivonen>
tametick: http://xiph.org/quicktime/

[01:49:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I would hope MP3 will be universally available soon since all remaining patents on it expire in at most a few years

[01:50:00.0000] <doublec>
cardona507: don't forget the "type=.." in the source

[01:50:01.0000] <cardona507>
that would be soooo nice - wav and ogg are great and everything but....

[01:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
kinda sad to go back to MP3 when Vorbis offers better compression

[01:50:03.0000] <cardona507>
doublec - I had only used type with video - 

[01:51:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
which browser does not support wave?

[01:51:01.0000] <tametick>
cardona507: so in that case it will play wav if it can and ogg if it can't?

[01:51:02.0000] <cardona507>
but yeah - it would make sense

[01:51:03.0000] <cardona507>
tametick - yep

[01:51:04.0000] <tametick>
ok thanks

[01:51:05.0000] <othermaciej>
as does AAC; but there's probably a lot more MP3s out there than any other format

[01:51:06.0000] <cardona507>
if you put type like doublec recommended above then the browser will only download it if it is the correct type 

[01:52:00.0000] <cardona507>
hsivonen - does vorbis offer better? 

[01:52:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
i thought almost all lossy audio formars offer better compression than mp3

[01:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
There weren't many lossy audio formats before MP3, as far as I'm aware

[01:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
and nobody would have bothered making ones afterwards that were worse

[01:53:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
indeed

[01:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
cardona507: I don't know about the relative technical merits of Vorbis and AAC. However, no one is collecting royalties for Vorbis.

[01:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think all the MP3 US patents expire on 2012 except for non-essential ones on optional ways to improve encoding quality

[01:54:02.0000] <tametick>
cardona507: actually i only need to use the audio api for sound effects (that need to play fast with as little latency as possible), i guess i could use that wav/ogg solution for that and just use plain old <embed> for background music, since latency is a lot less important for it

[01:54:03.0000] <tametick>
even midis would do

[01:54:04.0000] <tametick>
whatever is most supported 

[01:54:05.0000] <othermaciej>
*in 2012

[01:55:00.0000] <cardona507>
hsivonen - I agree completely

[01:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hopefully Mozilla and Opera will no longer have a problem with it at that point

[01:56:00.0000] <cardona507>
isn't there a whisper in the wind that google will release On2's codec as open? or is that only video - and strictly a rumor of course

[01:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(in fact I'm not sure there's any live patents on MP3 *de*coding any more, although IANAL)

[01:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
no one really knows what Google will do with On2

[01:56:03.0000] <cardona507>
yeah I figured - but it was worth a shot :)

[01:56:04.0000] <Philip`>
cardona507: Only video

[01:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but On2 has supposedly already granted whatever patents they have on their codecs (or rather made a non-assertion prmise)

[01:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
well, at least as to VP3.2 anyway

[01:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
VP3.2 being the ancestor of Ogg Vorbis

[01:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the worry about those is that other parties may have patents that are infringed

[01:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ITYM Theora

[01:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
er

[01:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah

[01:58:03.0000] <hsivonen>
(it seems plausible that On2 has patented stuff in the VP series after 3.2)

[01:58:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Theora

[01:58:05.0000] <hsivonen>
s/has/may have/

[01:58:06.0000] <cardona507>
perhaps google has something in house already that they needed On2 brains to dial in...

[01:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
VP3 was somewhat obsolete before they opened it

[01:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
kinda useless to speculate now, though, since the shareholder vote is in February

[01:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
and that was eight years ago

[01:59:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if they vote to adjourn again

[01:59:04.0000] <Philip`>
and they seem to have done a lot of new codecs since then

[02:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if it is a standard feature of corporate bylaws that merger requires a majority of shares outstanding, not just shares voted

[02:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess for a major company with lots of institutional investors it is unlikely to be a problem, but it still seems like poor design

[02:03:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
looks like most bugs are editorial, looking at the past 100 checkins

[02:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
which is good for the stage we are at

[02:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'd expect there's a significant bias because editorial bugs are far easier to spot than serious bugs

[02:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you're looking at checkins, another possible source of bias is that a greater proportion of non-editorial bugs get rejected

[02:06:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and maybe also easier for Hixie to fix

[02:06:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
or postponed

[02:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it's a sign that there's a need for test cases now, to find errors in the spec that aren't obvious from simply reading it

[02:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
and implementations

[02:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=537948 might turn out to be a spec bug (could be an implementation bug, though)

[02:11:00.0000] <roc>
speaking for myself I'd like to support MP3 the day the patents run out

[02:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: perhaps you should have your legal dept do the search on which patents are applicable to decoding and not facially invalid due to the Mp3 spec being prior art

[02:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: the longest-running ones go to 2017 but it looks like all the ones that are not expired already are non-essential encoder tricks

[02:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and in theory anything covered in the spec itself shouldn't be able to have a patent beyond 2012

[02:14:00.0000] <annevk>
has anyone implemented the document.domain blocking for storage?

[02:14:01.0000] <annevk>
we don't really like it apparently

[02:14:02.0000] <annevk>
too much additional security checks needed all over the place

[02:15:00.0000] <annevk>
also the spec seems somewhat wrong for the case where you do

[02:15:01.0000] <annevk>
var store = localStorage; document.domain = "example.org"; store.item = "foo" // does not throw

[02:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: givn the eolas patent, prior art doesn't seem to hold much weight with the courts these days

[02:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: please file a bug

[02:25:00.0000] <annevk>
I will after I somewhat more carefully check our position

[02:25:01.0000] <annevk>
well "our"

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
well there are various choices to solve the problem

[02:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
we could make a storage area for the "wildcard" port

[02:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
but that seemed like a high level of complexity given that we're trying to discourage document.domain

[02:31:00.0000] <annevk>
"wildcard" port?

[02:31:01.0000] <annevk>
what's the problem with multiple storage areas?

[02:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: BTW I have no confidence whatsoever that the ES people will want to specify btoa and atob given their typical attriude towards the legacy

[02:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
they do have a bad attitude

[02:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but if IE doesn't have them, then they might not really be needed for Web compat

[02:34:02.0000] <annevk>
maybe IE has equivalent methods people use

[02:35:00.0000] <annevk>
and the methods are somewhat useful

[02:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: once you set document.domain, the origin becomes something with a wildcard port

[02:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok seriously microsoft, wtf. i need to install silverlight to watch the CES keynote video?!

[02:37:02.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: It is not clear if they are really needed but at least Webkit and Opera have felt it useful to add them when they didn't already exist 

[02:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: well if they refuse, reopen the bug and i'll do it

[02:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: we added a lot of Firefox JS extensions kind of reflexively back in the day

[02:39:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, but we also still know the original origin

[02:39:01.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, could just continue using that

[02:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: no, that would result in a mutex deadlock

[02:40:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, and not let document.domain have any effect whatsoever

[02:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: since changing document.domain lets you call scripts cross-origin synchronously

[02:40:02.0000] <annevk>
aah, that was the reason

[02:40:03.0000] <annevk>
I see

[02:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.tagesspiegel.de/magazin/werbinich/wir-muessen-reden/ - if(window.pkcs11){ if(document.ids){ window.location = "/errorpages/ns6.html"; } else if(!window.atob) window.location = "http://www.tagesspiegel.de/errorpages/ns6.html"; }

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
o_O

[02:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know of a good example of where a disclosure triangle is visible in stock OSX?

[02:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yes

[02:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Finer Get Info window

[02:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
ooh good idea

[02:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hit Cmd-I with a file selected and you can see a bunch of them in a row

[02:50:04.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.hfxmitterer.de/go.to/modix/3,1,rxnw3mz/fahrzeugsuche.html?sort=&ftyp=&gtyp=&fart=&version=320 - if(document.defaultCharset && !window.atob) BrowserIsIE = true;

[02:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
So far, it looks like the implementation of the function is irrelevant, all that matters is whether it exists or not

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
wtf, my desktop seems to be hung

[02:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
finder works fine except it won't react to clicks on the desktop

[02:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
and new files aren't showing up

[02:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Those two sites are the only ones that use atob/btoa, out of 425K pages

[03:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
there. now pillar can no longer be jealous that hedral's the only one with all the examples.

[03:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: how should i handle bugs that are just questions, e.g. http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8661 ? (I mean, other than answering the question, which I will do, obviously.)

[03:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
reject? partial accept? "i don't understand"?

[03:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: not really sure

[03:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: this one has an implied spec change based on a faulty premise in addition to the question

[03:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
i.e. it says there is a contradiction which actually there is not

[03:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so I'd handle this one on that basis (in addition to answering the question)

[03:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if a bug really just asked a question without any report of a problem or request for a change (even implied), then I would consider that INVALID, same as garbage text or a completely off-topic comment

[03:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or maybe NEEDSINFO if it seemed like the person was getting at something but failed to express themselves

[03:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[03:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
man i'm not even keeping up with the incoming bugs today

[03:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
Clearly we need more editors, since you can't cope with the volume

[03:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i know we need more editors

[03:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
we have piles of specs that are languishing

[03:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
you don't happen to be looking for a job or anything are you? :-)

[03:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me has lost track of how much PhD Philip` has left to do

[03:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
Is it supposed to be finished this September or next September)?

[03:58:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I can hardly keep up with the bugmail :)

[03:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
I've lost track of it too

[03:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[03:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip` is firmly ensconced in academia i see

[03:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
I started a bit over two years ago, so it'll be however long it takes

[04:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
So I guess it is, in theory, supposed to be finished this September

[04:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
Or that's when they stop giving you money or something

[04:00:02.0000] <jgraham>
(and then a while after that they get really annoyed)

[04:00:03.0000] <Philip`>
The initial funding was for 3 years

[04:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
though it seems pretty rare for people to finish in that time

[04:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
They get really annoyed if you take more than 4 years, I think

[04:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
(or was it 5?)

[04:01:03.0000] <jgraham>
I think it's 4

[04:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I got 4 years of funding but I really really had to finish in 4 even so)

[04:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me should probably know more about this than he does

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok i give up, going to bed!

[04:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Anyway, I suppose it should be finished in a finite time, and then I'll need to work out what to do next :-)

[04:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:06:00.0000] <jgraham>
gn

[04:06:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: "A finite time" isn't much of a constraint

[04:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Given that it's somewhat impossible to finish something in infinite time :P

[04:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: You could finish it in the limit as t->inf

[04:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Once you finish it, t stops approaching inf :)

[04:36:00.0000] <workmad3>
Dashiva: working out the decimal value of pi takes infinite time

[04:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And you won't finish 

[04:37:01.0000] <workmad3>
sure you will, once t reaches infinity :P

[04:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
How do you know you won't reach the end of pi and get nothing but 0 digits after it?

[04:39:00.0000] <workmad3>
Philip`: pretty sure it's been proven that pi doesn't end

[04:39:01.0000] <workmad3>
something to do with it being a transcendental number or something

[04:39:02.0000] <workmad3>
same with e

[04:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
Bah, that's just a proof

[04:40:00.0000] <workmad3>
yeah, what do those mathematicians that spent their life working on such things know? :P

[04:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
The mathematicians will be sorry when somebody bothers to print out the end of pi and realises it's all 0s

[04:41:00.0000] <workmad3>
Philip`: yeah, the mathematicians will probably come up with some excuse, along the lines of a computer only has finite precision or something :P

[04:41:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But they'll have to print an infinite number of 0s still, so it doesn't change much :P

[04:41:02.0000] <Philip`>
They could compress it

[04:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But then they'd have to check all the digits first to make sure they were zero

[05:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: instead of LATER, shouldn't bugs remain open in a HTML6 or somesuch bugzilla component?

[05:45:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
there's an "HTML future versions" component

[06:08:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
is there an ogg video that i can use for a demo?

[06:08:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
preferably a movie trailer or similar

[06:09:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2008/10/html-5-video-element-examples.html links a bunch

[06:11:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
thanks

[06:16:00.0000] <annevk>
has anyone actually implemented the storage mutex?

[06:16:01.0000] <annevk>
or the document.domain localStorage thing?

[06:16:02.0000] <annevk>
it seems like it's all #fail

[06:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does Safari have localStorage?

[06:22:00.0000] <annevk>
yes

[06:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
what about Opera?

[06:22:02.0000] <annevk>
10.5

[06:22:03.0000] <hsivonen>
so it's pretty much everywhere--and without the mutex?

[06:23:00.0000] <annevk>
yes

[06:23:01.0000] <annevk>
or the document.domain stuff

[06:23:02.0000] <annevk>
afaict

[06:24:00.0000] <annevk>
(based on very limited testing and inspection)

[06:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on a totally different topic: if I want IMAP+Webmail that doesn't suck, what should I be evaluating besides Zimbra and Gmail?

[06:26:00.0000] <annevk>
/me only knows about Gmail being nice for Webmail

[06:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm concerned that if something goes wrong with my account and I lose access, I'm paying Google nothing and I'm one among millions, so that Google doesn't have enough of a reason to care and I have no recourse

[06:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, I'm not too thrilled about having all my email analyzed

[06:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
moreover, I care about the Freedom to Leave, so I should have at least existence proof of where to I could leave

[06:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
self-hosting Zimbra seems like a total overkill

[06:31:00.0000] <annevk>
you have some kind of mail server with your host right?

[06:31:01.0000] <annevk>
you could always move there

[06:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, if you don't like self-hosting, are there any problems with the Zimbra accounts they host for you?

[06:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: only if quota there is large enough and Webmail there doesn't suck

[06:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Since you're one among millions, a problem will either affect lots of people and therefore be important to fix quickly, or it will affect one person and there's a million-to-one chance it won't be you

[06:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: who's "they"?

[06:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
I guess, what they call "ZCS hosted email by a Zimbra partner" - http://www.zimbra.com/learn/

[06:34:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, so what do you do if competition is not good enough?

[06:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: the list of partners looked very sad in terms of choice of jurisdiction and descriptions of services on the Web

[06:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I haven't yet decided what to do

[06:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it bothers me that I haven't found an offering for email&Jabber hosting that were competitive with Google Apps for Domains

[06:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
open protocols aren't much good if Google doesn't have other providers to federate with

[06:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if Wave takes off, it'll be even harder to get non-Google email+Jabber+Wave hosting without being an enterprise with staff for figuring it out

[06:38:00.0000] <annevk>
lol

[06:38:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
 /me is reminded about the google toilet video

[06:38:02.0000] <annevk>
http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2010/html5-it-is-a-changin/ is funny

[06:38:03.0000] <hsivonen>
it not only bothers me that I don't know how to solve this for me

[06:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but I also don't have a non-Google solution to point family members to

[06:39:01.0000] <annevk>
seems sort of natural for Mozilla to enter this space

[06:39:02.0000] <annevk>
especially with their statement on the homepage

[06:40:00.0000] <annevk>
"We believe that the internet should be public, open and accessible."

[06:40:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, though it's a huge fail, I guess you could look into Mobile Me

[06:40:02.0000] <annevk>
from Apple

[06:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me feels compelled to mention OperaMail

[06:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me runs...

[06:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
Is that the one with 2Mb of space?

[06:41:03.0000] <Lachy>
no.

[06:41:04.0000] <Lachy>
3MB

[06:41:05.0000] <Philip`>
How about Outlook?

[06:42:00.0000] <annevk>
does that still exist?

[06:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me shrugs

[06:42:02.0000] <annevk>
right :p

[06:42:03.0000] <Philip`>
All the other browser vendors got mentioned so Microsoft shouldn't be left out :-p

[06:42:04.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, don't you mean ExchangeServer? Outlook is the client

[06:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I don't trust Microsoft's commitment to open specs enough to use their hosted services. I don't want to find that one day IMAP has been replaced by Exchange protocols and Webmail by Silverlightmail

[06:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and I don't trust Yahoo!'s corporate longevity enough

[06:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
Microsoft have already tried to replace IMAP with their own protocols

[06:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
and they've largely succeeded, given how pervasive Exchange is in the enterprise market, and why Outlook is the most popular client because there isn't much else that's compatible with it

[06:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
s/tried to/succeeded in/ for the purposes of many large intranets

[06:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
though Apple Mail is now I think they've licensed it

[06:45:03.0000] <jgraham>
Oh you said that

[06:47:00.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: I host my own (for mail servers) but didn't install any webmail, which I found suboptimal. But I may be a very particular case.  

[06:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
also, as a matter of principle, I think one should try to minimize the probability that a communication host provides a feed to foreign three-letter agencies

[06:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
otoh, hosting in Finland means that even the regular police can take your servers at a whim

[06:47:03.0000] <annevk>
or four :)

[06:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
To be honest, having the TLAs be homegrown doesn't make it any better.

[06:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
karlcow, do you have your own servers, or do you mean you rent a server from some company like Dreamhost or whatever, who have mail set up on them for you?

[06:48:02.0000] <karlcow>
I have my own physical machine (1U) in a bay.

[06:48:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though I suppose we Americans can at least pretend we can change something about their operation.

[06:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
nice. Is that stored at some hosting facility, or run it from home?

[06:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me wanted to do that one day, but too expensive right now

[06:49:02.0000] <karlcow>
I have had a machine for now… hmmm… more than 10 years. not from home, and had different hosting facilities.

[06:50:00.0000] <karlcow>
including friends, organization, etc.

[06:50:01.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: If we're being picky MI5 is only two letters :)

[06:50:02.0000] <karlcow>
I know in Montreal one of the cheapest hosting services is http://iweb.com/

[06:51:00.0000] <annevk>
jgraham, it's all falling apart

[06:51:01.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen and his fancy words :p

[06:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
karlcow: I'm considering a lifestyle change to more cloud apps. for that to work, Webmail must not suck.

[06:57:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me is trying to make the link between the cloud and webmail

[06:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, even if I end up continuing to use IMAP clients, I want server-side filtering to keep my mail filters the same regardless of client machine

[06:58:01.0000] <karlcow>
hsivonen: yes, I use procmail on the server side which gives me some filtering like classifying my mail in a dated space.

[06:59:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
http://simon.html5.org/sandbox/html/video/ - a little experiment

[06:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm using cloud app in the sense that the app core is on a server somewhere and the UI runs in a browser

[06:59:02.0000] <karlcow>
ah ok. understood.

[07:00:00.0000] <daedb>
zcorpan_: Neat :)

[07:00:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
daedb: thanks

[07:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan_: I like it!

[07:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
^_^

[07:02:02.0000] <annevk>
what's up with the script being there twice?

[07:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dammit, annevk, I was just about to ask that.

[07:04:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
what script?

[07:04:01.0000] <annevk>
the one at the end?

[07:04:02.0000] <annevk>
well, the two...

[07:05:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
i only see one script

[07:05:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
oh wait

[07:06:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
wtf

[07:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan_, I just see the video centred in the page, with seemingly no special effect, and get script errors

[07:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
Using Minefield.

[07:09:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
seems like a bug in chrome's view source the extra script

[07:09:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me finally finds a browser it works in, at the third try

[07:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Over here in current public chrome, I'm not seeing the <canvas> stretched across the whole viewport, like the CSS suggests it should be.

[07:09:03.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, which browser worked for you?

[07:09:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
It fills perhaps the center 3/4.

[07:09:05.0000] <jgraham>
chrome

[07:10:00.0000] <annevk>
works in 10.5 too

[07:10:01.0000] <annevk>
but looks different

[07:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
annevk: On linux?

[07:10:03.0000] <annevk>
yes

[07:10:04.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm, not for me

[07:10:05.0000] <annevk>
maybe it does not like you

[07:10:06.0000] <jgraham>
No it does not; it just crahsed my 10.50

[07:11:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
chrome has blocky canvas rendering, it's nicer in opera

[07:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
latest internal mac build of 10.50 isn't working for me at all.

[07:11:02.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: dunno why it doesn't work in firefox

[07:11:03.0000] <jgraham>
when it works (/me sulks)

[07:11:04.0000] <annevk>
parsing

[07:11:05.0000] <annevk>
prolly

[07:11:06.0000] <annevk>
there's no content

[07:12:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
it still doesn't work with html5.enable for me

[07:12:01.0000] <annevk>
oh

[07:13:00.0000] <annevk>
well, with html5.enable the error does change

[07:13:01.0000] <annevk>
the <canvas> is found for instance

[07:13:02.0000] <annevk>
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIDOMCanvasRenderingContext2D.drawImage]"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: http://simon.html5.org/sandbox/html/video/ :: anonymous :: line 16"  data: no]

[07:13:03.0000] <annevk>
is what I get now

[07:13:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, wait, nm.  I get why it doens't stretch to the whole screen.  Because the drawImage is only 1,1,4,4, duh.

[07:13:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Still, pretty awesome.

[07:14:00.0000] <annevk>
so in Opera it's not blocky because?

[07:14:01.0000] <annevk>
must be because we have a high-res backing store suddenly...

[07:14:02.0000] <annevk>
thought we didn't want that?

[07:15:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
because it's smooth instead :)

[07:15:01.0000] <annevk>
jaja

[07:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan_, why don't you remove the thick white border from the video?

[07:16:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: i guess chrome uses nearest neighbour and we use bicubic or something

[07:16:01.0000] <zcorpan_>
annevk: i don't think it has anything to do with highres backing store

[07:17:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: because i wanted a thick white border

[07:17:01.0000] <annevk>
well, the result is stored in 16-canvas pixels

[07:17:02.0000] <annevk>
that's not a lot

[07:17:03.0000] <zcorpan_>
36

[07:17:04.0000] <annevk>
i thought the graphic was only drawn at a 4*4 space?

[07:18:00.0000] <annevk>
regardless, you cannot get that smooth in such a small area, afaict

[07:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm, it's not wanting to work when I download the video and run the page from my desktop...

[07:20:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
TabAtkins: with opera?

[07:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
With Chrome.

[07:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Does video run with origin restrictions by default?  Do those act weird with file:// urls?

[07:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'll try opening it through localhost...

[07:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
I found a version of Opera 10.5 that isn't completely broken, but still doesn't work for me on mac. annevk, which build are you using?

[07:21:03.0000] <annevk>
not a Mac

[07:22:00.0000] <annevk>
6177

[07:22:01.0000] <annevk>
for Ubuntu 64-bit

[07:22:02.0000] <annevk>
it is teh awesome

[07:22:03.0000] <annevk>
apart from all the bugs

[07:22:04.0000] <zcorpan_>
Lachy: video doesn't work on mac yet

[07:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, ok.

[07:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, localhost worked, once I restarted apache.

[07:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan_: What's with the extraneous <div>?  Remnant of previous hacking?

[07:28:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
TabAtkins: yeah. removed

[07:29:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
wonder if it starts working in firefox if i add a try/catch around drawimage

[07:31:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
nope

[08:47:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6062Z720100107

[08:50:00.0000] <cardona507>
wow - they must really want it

[08:51:00.0000] <cardona507>
let's hope it brings us a video codec :)

[08:51:01.0000] <annevk>
oh yes

[08:51:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ooh, cool.

[08:51:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Damn On2.  Just give up already.  >_<

[08:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why would they give up, when they can wait to get more money from Google?

[08:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Damn your game-theoretic logic!

[08:52:02.0000] <cardona507>
It looks like their waiting is PAYING off.... (pun intended)

[09:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh crap, microdata will be split :-(. I can't believe the obviously flawed arguments for that position won out over the technical superiority of the arguments against.

[09:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, are you really surprised?

[09:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I expected it.

[09:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
As I'm reading the procedure, TBL has to personally sign off on it to go to Last Call, right?  And the TAG, which is headed by TBL, strongly requested that it be split?

[09:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sigh.  RDFa doesn't have major implementations.  The major cited implementations are supporting a language vaguely similar to RDFa in syntax, but different in significant ways.

[10:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Better for the chairs to save their energy for more important things, if they have to fight against the W3C administration over anything.

[10:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I imagine there's a limit to how much they can put in the spec against the TAG's wishes and still get the spec approved for progression.

[10:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although I don't actually know anything about how the W3C works, so I'm just guessing here.

[10:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think TimBL could really overrule a WG decision if it had been decided to keep it, regardless of Tim's or the TAG's position on the issue

[10:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Doesn't the W3C procedure say that the Director needs to personally approve specs for them to progress?

[10:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Yahoo's is fairly close to RDFa, if I remember correctly

[10:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's basically to confirm that proper W3C procedures have been followed during it's development, rather than having the director say whether or not he agrees with everything in the spec

[10:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
(though Google's isn't)

[10:02:03.0000] <Philip`>
(but Google's doesn't even do HTML or XML, just something vaguely similar to them in syntax)

[10:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Ah, okay.

[10:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, anyway, it makes no technical difference, just a PR difference.

[10:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Yeah.

[10:03:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd prefer for us to lose this fight than a lot of other fights that are coming up.

[10:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm confident that Microdata will ultimately win in the market place anyway, especially given the support I've seen from some in the microformats community

[10:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm glad to hear that.

[10:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, yeah.  Microformats generally map *directly* to a Microdata vocabulary in an extremely obvious way, nearly to the point of just being able to search/replace the current class-based syntax with a Microdata-based one.

[10:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
but, you're right, there are bigger fights coming up that are more important than this

[10:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But I'm in an awkward position as a web developer, with one well-established spec that a W3C Recommendation and everyone's heard of, and a better spec that's not in any W3C spec anymore, as soon as it's removed from the HTML5 draft.

[10:05:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, CC license metadata is currently only de facto standard in RDFa, IIRC.

[10:05:04.0000] <Lachy>
the next step for this issue is just to take Microdata to FPWD

[10:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I assume that will probably happen, given the enthusiasm from the RDFa camp about equal footings and all.

[10:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does anyone know someone at the CC who they could convince to have an official microdata vocabulary for CC licenses and encourage people to use that instead of RDFa?

[10:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
We now have a few major parties that are consuming some form of RDFa, none for microdata that I see.

[10:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well.

[10:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm sure there are people in the RDFa camp who would personally rather see microdata just die, but who've held a public position of leveling the playing field

[10:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, which is why I think we'll probably get a FPWD.

[10:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, the mail you sent seems to be incomplete

[10:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because most of them will be at least reluctant to admit that.

[10:09:03.0000] <Lachy>
it's chopped off after "functionality such as"

[10:09:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: looks ok to me when I open the attachment

[10:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
and there's a mistake in it where it says "Also, the partial reliance on HTML5-specific features, such as  or , does not"

[10:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
attachment also looks ok in the archives: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/att-0218/issue-76-decision.html

[10:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I also do not see that error in the archive

[10:10:03.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I didn't realise it was an attachment. I was just reading it directly in my mail client

[10:10:04.0000] <othermaciej>
"Also, the partial reliance on HTML5-specific features, such as <time> or <meta>"

[10:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
it just shows up as plain text for me, so it looked the same

[10:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I did notice some other typosand formatting errors though

[10:11:02.0000] <Lachy>
so it's a bug in my mail client that it doesn't show HTML attachments properly

[10:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I was hesitant to send it as HTML at all but worse case people can read it in the archives I guess

[10:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
What's this newfangled "HTML" you're trying to make us read?

[10:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I know, right?

[10:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Plain text was good enough for typewriter users, it should be good enough for us

[10:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
my only regret in this issue is that I never got around to debunking the claim about how splitting it would somehow level the playing field, but that's just cause I went on holidays just before the poll was announced

[10:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
I like how Gmail gives me three different ways to access the attachment, without even attempting to explain the difference between them

[10:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's the problem with adding new features.

[10:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I'm guessing there's options to download and another to view. What's the third?

[10:20:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Work>
Lachy: create a google doc

[10:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Open as a Google Document

[10:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and View and Download)

[10:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
"We're sorry, but Google Docs has encountered an unexpected error." - hmm, that narrows down the (working) choices

[10:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
errMsg=invalid+URI%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FTR%2Fhtml5%2Fmicrodata.html%23microdata%0A - odd

[10:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
(in the URL of the error page)

[10:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"There's nothing special about boolean attributes in this case. In the

[10:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML5 text/html syntax the attribute value can always be omitted to say

[10:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
that the value is the empty string."

[10:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Huh, I never knew that.

[10:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's pretty neat.

[10:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
It couldn't really do anything else

[10:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
given how the DOM works

[10:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
(i.e. given that attributes have a name and value and nothing much else)

[10:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could say it's invalid, though, and/or specify some other way of parsing it.

[10:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, different for boolean attributes and others.

[10:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But this makes sense.

[10:51:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me will have to add that to MediaWiki's Html class

[10:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you could parse it some other way, what would you do?

[10:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose you could drop the entire attribute, but I can't think of anything else sane

[10:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I had assumed it was invalid, I guess.

[10:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd have probably expected it to be parsed as having an empty string if it was actually present, though.

[10:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, okay

[10:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But that's implementer stuff, I don't think about that.

[10:53:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm an author.

[10:53:04.0000] <Philip`>
(Maybe it should be invalid)

[10:53:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It does seem somewhat confusing.  But hey, I don't mind the extra three bytes.

[11:09:00.0000] <foolip>
so who wants to gamble on how Microdata will be split over (a) W3C HTML5 (b) WHATWG HTML5 and (c) WHATWG HTML ?

[11:13:00.0000] <foolip>
/me hopes for no split at all in (b) and (c), at the very least (c)

[11:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me hopes for (a) and (b) to be equivalent

[11:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
(unless they've already diverged?)

[11:14:02.0000] <foolip>
not to my knowledge

[11:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me bets on a separate spec in the W3C, same spec at WHATWG

[11:25:00.0000] <foolip>
/me facepalms over dads insitence to live in happy happy quirks mode land instead of fixing his CSS bugs

[11:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Quirks mode works about as consistently as standards mode, so if people want to use it, why not?

[11:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, I won't, but it's not worth going to much effort to rewrite your site for.

[11:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
quirks mode is much less consistent between different browsers

[11:28:03.0000] <foolip>
what about IE's box model?

[11:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, HTML5 wants to make quirks mode consistent between browsers, at least, so your dad can just wait a few years.

[11:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unless IE sticks with legacy modes forever.

[11:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, if it makes him happy, I don't care, let him stick with non-standard stuff.

[11:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not all bugs are critical, he probably has better things to do.

[11:30:00.0000] <foolip>
it started out as a IE-only bug

[11:30:01.0000] <foolip>
I don't suggest rewriting just because it's fun

[12:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, (a) and (b) have already diverged

[12:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. the new device element in the WHATWG spec, which is not in W3C HTML5

[12:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's why the WHATWG copy is now called "WHATWG HTML (Including HTML5)"

[12:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
so I would assume the split will only affect the W3C copy

[12:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
but, at the very least, it will stay in complete.html

[12:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I thought that was the difference between foolip's (b) and (c)

[12:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
and (b) was the version that matched (a)

[12:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, huh? My understanding was that foolip was referring to (a) w3.org copy, (b) whatwg /current-work/ and (c) whatwg /current-work/complete.html

[12:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
in this case, (a) and (b) are mostly identical, except for the header (basically everything above the TOC) and the recent introduction of the device element.

[12:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
/current-work/ is HTML, not HTML5

[12:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
and (b) is a subset of (c), which incorporates several other specs.

[12:37:03.0000] <Philip`>
/html5/ is HTML5

[12:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
complete.html is not any kind of HTML at all

[12:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
(where "/html5/" means http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/html5/, not http://www.whatwg.org/html5/)

[12:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh. I wasn't aware of that copy

[12:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_various_versions_of_the_spec.3F should make it all wonderfully clear

[12:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
I can't find anywhere on whatwg.org that actually links to the web-apps/html5/ copy

[12:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders how the crieria used to spilt out microdata apply to other parts of the specification

[12:48:01.0000] <cardona507>
what is a shadow dom?

[12:48:02.0000] <jgraham>
In particular "maturity" and "market success"

[12:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
cardona507: In what contex? XBL defines an officil meaning but it has been used in a different sense to talk about <canvas> accessibility

[12:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm not sure precisely how the <canvas> folks are using the term, but when you hear it in reference to XBL2, it means a special transformed DOM that is only accessible to CSS.

[12:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Javascript still sees the original, untransformed DOM.

[12:50:02.0000] <cardona507>
I was just reading a canvas accessibility email from HTMLwg and I am unclear by "shadow dom" - tabatkins - only accessible to css? what are the benefits?

[12:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
cardona507: http://www.w3.org/TR/xbl/#shadow is what xbl means

[12:51:01.0000] <cardona507>
cool - thanks jgraham

[12:51:02.0000] <Philip`>
In the canvas accessibility discussion, it just means the DOM subtree of the <canvas> element (which doesn't get rendered in graphical browsers), as far as I'm aware

[12:51:03.0000] <jgraham>
in the <canvas> case they just mean "desendants of the canvas element" as I understand it

[12:51:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
cardona507: The benefit is that it allows you to do transformations that don't actually make sense from a content perspective, but are necessary for styling.  Like, say, wrapping a box in multiple <div>s so that you can style each one.

[12:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in the case of <canvas> it's just the descendants of canvas which are not rendered, but are exposed to accessibility tools, per the spec

[12:52:01.0000] <cardona507>
ahhh - I see - thanks othermaciej

[12:52:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The fact that your styling happens to be easier to apply when you have a structure like <div><div><div><div>foo</div></div></div></div> shouldn't have any effect on your actual content, which just uses <div>foo</div>.

[12:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: most of the individual criteria were not enough to decide the matter by themselves, and it's not clear if any other part of the spec is precisely in the somewhat unusual position that Microdata is in

[12:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What precisely *is* the unusual position Microdata is in?

[12:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: plus, we're not going to rule on splitting anything that no one actually objects to

[12:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
read the long review of arguments

[12:54:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: That still leaves you with, iirc, something like half a dozen requests to remove things.  ^_^

[12:54:04.0000] <Philip`>
Isn't the XBL thing going to be a nightmare for debugging and for understanding what tree structure your document represents?

[12:54:05.0000] <othermaciej>
and see if you think those same arguments all apply equally to any other part of the spec

[12:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip: I don't think so.  The kind of reorganizing you can do is relatively limited.

[12:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, I am interested in moving on to the next issue on deck which is the dt/dd/details/figure thing

[12:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I hope someone else writes an alternate proposal for that because I am not really keen on <fltcap>

[12:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I might have to write one myself, or more than one

[12:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I still have *no* clue what fltcap is supposed to stand for.  I see that "cap" part is for "caption", but what is "flt"?

[12:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's supposed to stand for "floating caption"

[12:56:03.0000] <jgraham>
Oh I forot about that issue

[12:56:04.0000] <Lachy>
the right way to deal with that is, since Hixie won't introduce new elements, is to drop both figure and details from the spec and reintroduce them with <legend> in the future when the parsing issues are resolved with it.

[12:56:05.0000] <Lachy>
ah, rending issues.

[12:56:06.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah there needs to be another chage proposal at least

[12:56:07.0000] <Lachy>
*rendering

[12:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, someone should write down what I just said as a change proposal

[12:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
as far as I am aware, that is not an ordinary term of art for the caption for a figure, let alone the label of a disclosure control

[12:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I am considering writing Change Proposals for one or more of the following:

[12:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
1) Use <caption> for <figure> and <label> for <details>, with a slight tweak to parsing so that <caption> inside <figure> does not break tables

[12:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
that would be nice if you think the legacy issues with <caption> aren't insurmountable

[12:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
2) Introduce new elements <fcaption> and <dlabel> because it's totally a standard design pattern for HTML elements with compound structure to have specialized helper elements that exist only for purposes of their structure

[12:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
I like <c> as an element name, which I've suggested before

[12:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
despite Hixie's distaste for the idea, we have tbody, thead, tfoot, tr, td and caption which are (currently) only used for tables, li only for lists, dt/dd previously only for dl, param only for object

[12:59:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The issues with <caption> only arise when you put a <figure> inside of a <table> anyway.  If you can avoid that you're golden.

[12:59:03.0000] <Lachy>
I think I've also suggested <description>

[13:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: and parsing can be changed in the future to make it not a problem in the long run, so I think it's better than <legend>, since both are fixable and in the short term <caption> only affects <figure> in <table>

[13:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
3) Suggest using <h1> (or some other <hn> element) for figure captions and the label of <details>

[13:00:02.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, given how many legacy pages there are using layout tables around the whole page, I don't think it's unrealistic for a <figure> to end up being added to an old template like that

[13:00:03.0000] <jgraham>
I think my general opinion is that a) parsing issues should not be underestimated and b) adding more elements is not a problem

[13:00:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then they just wait for parsing changes before doing so, Lachy.

[13:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I asked Hixie what the problem with <h1> would be and he said it might interfere with the content model of <figure>

[13:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
Seriously people "just wait for parsing changes" is a really bad strategy

[13:01:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't like the idea of reusing heading elements, since a caption is not a heading. It's a very different concept, and I think the default styling of h1 will make it very unappealing to authors

[13:01:03.0000] <jgraham>
If we can't do something that can be deployed in legacy browsers we should wait for the next version of HTML

[13:01:04.0000] <othermaciej>
my reaction is that this is not a problem for <details>, and in the case of <figure> in the unusual case where you need headers inside the figure content, you can wrap it in a <div> or <section>

[13:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If the parsing changes are required to use it at *all*, like <legend>, it's a problem.  If they are more minor, it's less of a problem.

[13:02:01.0000] <jgraham>
"Needed to use it in a table based layout" is a serious problem

[13:02:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think <details><label> can be deployed in legacy browsers with essentially no problem, and <figure><caption> with problems only for figures in tables, but making it usable everywhere else

[13:02:03.0000] <Lachy>
also, reusing h1 to h6 for this will make stylesheets overly complicated, since authors wanting to apply styles to headings will have to do some magic with their CSS to undo the styles for figure>h1

[13:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I agree with you in general that adding new elements is not a problem; Hixie seems to be almost alone in very strongly opposing new elements

[13:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
out of my 3 proposals I most prefer <fcaption>+<dlabel>

[13:03:02.0000] <Lachy>
I think Hixie's stance on new elements is not supported by sound rationale

[13:03:03.0000] <othermaciej>
because, like I said, specialized child elements for structured containers are totally normal

[13:04:00.0000] <cardona507>
When does the HTML5wg charter end? when the spec is finished?

[13:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
heck, <datagrid> introduced half a dozen specialized children

[13:04:02.0000] <jgraham>
(the reason I think that deploying things that cannot work in the legacy is bad is that authours read a bunch of tutorials saying "well you can't actually use this because of legacy concerns" and then ten years later when the legacy concerns are gone, people still cargo-cult whatever workaround was developed in the inierim)

[13:04:03.0000] <othermaciej>
cardona507: it expires at the end of this year, but will hopefully be renewed

[13:04:04.0000] <cardona507>
is there really any doubt???

[13:04:05.0000] <Lachy>
nice. When we renew it, can we fix the mistakes that sadly ended up in the current one?

[13:04:06.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, if anyone wants to write up any of my 3 ideas as a Change Proposal, please volunteer on the list (or just do it)

[13:04:07.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Yes, Hixie's position seems to be based mainly on aesthetics

[13:04:08.0000] <cardona507>
what would happen if it wasn't renewed? who owns the copyright? w3c or whatwg?

[13:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: I'll do so.

[13:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or any other ideas

[13:05:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'll have some for you by Sunday.

[13:05:03.0000] <othermaciej>
if no one proposes an idea I like by the day before the deadline, I will volunteer myself and ask for an extensio

[13:05:04.0000] <othermaciej>
*extension

[13:05:05.0000] <Lachy>
cardona507, the WHATWG maintains dual-copyright on the spec

[13:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
when is the deadline?

[13:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
another idea that was raised before was adding a caption global attribute so you could use <p caption> or <h1 caption> or whatever

[13:06:02.0000] <cardona507>
when will we know if HTMLwg charter is gonna be renewed?

[13:06:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That one's definitely going in, since I think I'm the one that originated it.  ^_^

[13:06:04.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that was originally my idea. I'm not a big fan of that. But I think TabAtkins was

[13:06:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ok, maybe Lachy did.

[13:06:06.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, you stole it from me :-)

[13:06:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Be flattered.  ^_^

[13:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I don't mind at all

[13:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: FWIW I think that proposal sucks :)

[13:07:02.0000] <daedb>
I'm for anything that keeps figure and details in the spec, dropping (or postponing to a future version) them is the only thing I'm very strongly against.

[13:07:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't like that one very much

[13:07:04.0000] <Lachy>
this is going to be confusing if we get 5 change proposals to choose between

[13:07:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: fwiw I think YOU suck.

[13:07:06.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess it's marginally better than <fltcap> but not much

[13:07:07.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: A fir assessment

[13:07:08.0000] <jgraham>
+a

[13:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: if we get many proposals perhaps some end up merging or getting withdrawn based on discussion

[13:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
what does "fltcap" stand for?

[13:08:02.0000] <jgraham>
heh

[13:08:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
"floating caption".

[13:08:04.0000] <othermaciej>
"floating caption"

[13:08:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
For some reason.

[13:08:06.0000] <Lachy>
oh. wtf?

[13:08:07.0000] <Philip`>
Flute cape

[13:08:08.0000] <jgraham>
I think it might be a term from print media

[13:08:09.0000] <Philip`>
It's a kind of musical garment

[13:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, that idea sucks big time. We can't have a name that will have authors asking "wtf?" all the time.

[13:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think the proposal was particularly fixated on the name, and said it could be easily changed

[13:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
(google suggets I m talking rubbish)

[13:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, I think we should merge the change proposals to introduce a new element together into one, and just list the possible alternatives. Then when people make their case for/against the change proposals, they can state the name preference

[13:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: The problem as I understand it is that we would have to adopt the proposal wholesale. So we would need the name at least temporarily

[13:10:03.0000] <daedb>
/me likes the <fcaption>, <dlabel> and <c> ideas

[13:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
And fixing up something that has already gone through the WG sasuage machine might get messy

[13:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
daedb, the problem with <c> is that it's only for <figure>. It doesn't have a matching alternative for details

[13:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
<c> could be used for <details> too, though 

[13:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think it's a great semantic fit

[13:11:04.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Did you mean "the WG assuage machine"?

[13:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Sounds like an appropriate term)

[13:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: I think there are reasonably strong differences between a proposal that has one element for both and seperate elements

[13:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
ultimately if this ends up in a decision it has to be a concrete proposal

[13:12:03.0000] <Lachy>
I also expect the usual objections about wasting single-letter element names, which came up so often in the whatwg when we were arguing about <m> and <x>, etc.

[13:12:04.0000] <jgraham>
And also for proposals that reuse elements vs ones that mint new ones

[13:12:05.0000] <othermaciej>
and since many of the concerns about this issue are aesthetic, the specific name of the element or elements will probably be important to people who care in the first place

[13:12:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
I vaguely remember <m> and <x> being discussed.  What was that about?

[13:13:00.0000] <daedb>
Lachy: I don't particularly care about <details> (though I want to keep it), <figure> is very important to me though. I just like <c> because it's short.

[13:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
<m> was the old name of <mark>

[13:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, fair point. I suppose we should wait and see what change proposals we end up with before we figure out merging

[13:13:03.0000] <jgraham>
plus I think a bunch of the justification in the existing proposal is bogus even though I sort of agree with the conclusion

[13:13:04.0000] <Lachy>
I haven't seen the existing change proposal yet

[13:13:05.0000] <Lachy>
got a pointer?

[13:13:06.0000] <daedb>
othermaciej: When did <m> change to <mark>?

[13:13:07.0000] <othermaciej>
don't remember

[13:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/ChangeProposals/DdDt

[13:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So we have four proposals:  (1) Leave it as it is. (2) Add a new element (for one or both). (3) Add an attribute (for one or both).

[13:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
everything relevant is listed on http://dev.w3.org/html5/status/issue-status.html

[13:14:03.0000] <daedb>
I just noticed that a few days ago or something... <m> was fine me.

[13:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think just the three different things I proposed are all materially different from each other to the point that people will have different opinions

[13:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/four/three/

[13:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
even though they all end up changing the element used for each

[13:15:03.0000] <othermaciej>
and would thus be in your #2

[13:15:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know if anyone but Hixie is willing to defend the status quo on this

[13:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, <caption> and <h1> should be #4.

[13:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(though I must admit I dislike dd/dt less than fltcap)

[13:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I even *like* dt/dd on details.

[13:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it reads bad on <figure>

[13:16:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
it mirrors how I'll often be coding it for styling, anyway

[13:16:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I agree.

[13:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's ok on <details> but not enough of a win to be better than a new element

[13:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The IE problems are pretty weird.

[13:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me dislikes dt/dd on details since he can barely remember which way around they go in dl

[13:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
s/details/figure/ or whatever

[13:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<fcaption>, <fbody>(optional), <dlabel>,<dbody>(optional)

[13:18:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`'s argument is my number one objection

[13:18:03.0000] <jgraham>
I think the confusion value is too high because the elements are so poorly named

[13:18:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Those sort of mirror the <table> naming method.

[13:18:05.0000] <Philip`>
Also, it seems entirely non-obvious when you've got it the wrong way round, because it won't render differently

[13:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me agrees, dt/dd on anything other than dl is really confusing

[13:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Huh?  Yeah it will.  <dd> has a margin-left by default, <dt> doesn't.

[13:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
there is a limit to how many very short element names you can get away with, and dt and dd don't make the short list

[13:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: I don't think it would render that way inside <details>

[13:19:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, right.  No it wouldn't.

[13:19:05.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: I want neither my image nor my caption to be indented

[13:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think dt/dd sort of works for details, but the compat problems are annoying for authors to have to deal with, especially since the workaround isn't all that intuitive, at least without understanding how IE's crazy parsing works

[13:20:01.0000] <daedb>
I prefer a new element (though I dislike the ftlcap name) for <figure> instead of dt/dd just because dt/dd feels like unnecessary wrapping most of the time.

[13:20:02.0000] <Lachy>
but I really hate dt/dd for figure. Worst. Idea. Ever.

[13:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so it sounds like out of my 3 ideas, fcaption/dlabel is probably the most popular in this crowd

[13:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
I would prefer <figcaption> over <fcaption> I think

[13:22:01.0000] <jgraham>
</bikeshed>

[13:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose the rationale against using dt/dd would be the same for virtually all change proposals, so we should have that clearly documented once, and then let the rest of the change proposals just argue which alternative is best

[13:22:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that's it, we should name the new element <bikeshed>

[13:23:00.0000] <daedb>
othermaciej: too long, let's use the abbreviated <bs> :)

[13:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why give this element such special status, compared to all the other bikesheds we have?

[13:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
(because it seems odd to spell out <figure> and spell out caption> but have a random f hanging around)

[13:23:03.0000] <othermaciej>
sure, everyone making their own rationale might not be the best use of time, I think it would be ok to cite another Change Proposal's rationale wholesale and the new rationale just explains why this proposal seems best

[13:23:04.0000] <othermaciej>
)

[13:23:05.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: It matches <table>/<head>/<thead>

[13:23:06.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: there is <tbody> for precedent

[13:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
the bikehed element needs two attributes <bikeshed color="blue" colour="blue"> to keep everyone happy

[13:24:01.0000] <webben>
othermaciej: I think if it needs to be an abbreviation those are good names ... following the pattern of tbody and iframe.

[13:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
Yeah but no one uses <thead> or <tbody> :)

[13:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
and noone cares what the i in <iframe> stands for

[13:24:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I use <thead> *constantly*.  But I guess I'm weird.

[13:24:05.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: You are

[13:25:00.0000] <webben>
/me would prefer figurecaption and detailslabel.

[13:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's so good for styling, though!

[13:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: http://philip.html5.org/data/tag-count-pages.txt - nobody uses thead

[13:25:03.0000] <Lachy>
why don't we go with <details><dhead><dbody></details>

[13:25:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't see how you can go without it, when you can easily do "thead th" versus "tbody th" for your row and column headers.

[13:25:05.0000] <Philip`>
Lots use tbody but they're probably from serializers

[13:25:06.0000] <Lachy>
/me runs before people start making jokes about why dhead is bad...

[13:25:07.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: Based on having looked at a lot of table markup when all the table accessibility stuff was still interesting, I can confirm that you are indeed weird

[13:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man…

[13:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Easier to do <td class="rowhead">

[13:26:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: I don't like <dhead> or <fhead> because neither are intuitive.

[13:26:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: … Or just do <th scope=row>

[13:27:00.0000] <webben>
what is "o:p" from Philip`'s list?

[13:27:01.0000] <webben>
some Microsoft Office thing?

[13:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
webben: Microsoft Word output

[13:27:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
An MS element.

[13:27:04.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, my suggestion was more of a joke, in case you haven't figured out the obvious alternative interpretation of what dhead stands for yet

[13:27:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Ah.  I have never, ever seen it abbreviated to dhead before, so I didn't think of it.

[13:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's not usually. That's just the obvious expansion

[13:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Maybe to you, with your dirty mind.

[13:28:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, so dirty…

[13:28:03.0000] <Lachy>
hah

[13:28:04.0000] <Philip`>
Doody head?

[13:28:05.0000] <Lachy>
close.

[13:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dunderhead?

[13:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me cannot think of any other possibilities

[13:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's fine. We'll spare your young mind from learning about more profanities

[13:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: You need too allow for the incorrect capilatisation. It is clearly supposed to be DhEAd which likely stands for Dharmic Epiphany Advent

[13:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
i.e. the suddent coming of a feeling that one must do ones righteous duty

[13:53:00.0000] <cardona507>
hsivonen - your opinion - http://img510.imageshack.us/img510/5561/whatwgcanvasexbutt0202.png for butt ----------- http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/760/whatwgcanvasexround.png for round ----------- & http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/8403/whatwgcanvasexsquare.png for square

[13:53:01.0000] <cardona507>
or anyone else's opinion of course

[13:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
cardona507: "canva sex butt"?

[13:56:01.0000] <cardona507>
haha! canvas ex butt :)

[13:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, who's the one with the filthy mind now, huh?

[13:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nope, canva sex butt, now and forever.  You can't ever put "ex" after "canvas" without some sort of separator.

[13:57:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The butt is just icing on the cake.

[13:57:03.0000] <cardona507>
:D - I can't now 

[13:57:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Still you.

[14:00:00.0000] <cardona507>
"The butt is just icing on the cake" - nice

[14:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
How about we use <rubric> for the new elements, define it to work the same as <caption>, <legend>, and <label> in the appropriate contexts, and eventually make all of the latter nonconforming?

[14:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, no.

[14:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
:(

[14:05:03.0000] <othermaciej>
if the concern is aesthetics, then I can't say <rubric> is a win

[14:05:04.0000] <Lachy>
if you look up the actual definition of rubric, rather than just checking a thesaurus, you'll understand why

[14:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
also, it's an aesthetically sucky name

[14:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, you don't think "red ocher" is an appropriate characterization?

[14:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, the dictionary gives one definition as "A title; a name".

[14:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which is what I meant it as, except it also conveys the idea of being sort of abbreviated, like legend/caption.

[14:07:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(although <label> is actually a sort of separate concept)

[14:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't even know what rubric *means*.

[14:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And I'm a word geek.

[14:13:00.0000] <cardona507>
yeah - rubric isn't too common to us dumbed down Amairicans

[14:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think rubric is too common among people who aren't 14th century priests

[14:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
cardona507: The round one is the wrong shape

[14:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It should be a semicircle on the end)

[14:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
The rectangles look odd since they're antialiased on the right and not the left

[14:17:00.0000] <cardona507>
Philip`:  - fixing round - I don't see the antialias - on all 3 or which one? and are they too small? should I scale them up slightly?

[14:18:00.0000] <cardona507>
I kinda see the anti alias now - wierd

[14:19:00.0000] <daedb>
AryehGregor: <rubric> is too close to the swedish word rubrik for my taste

[14:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
I've heard "rubric" quite frequently, for the instructions on the front of exam papers

[14:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
What does the Swedish word "rubrik" mean?

[14:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
cardona507: Could make them SVG so they're scalable :-)

[14:19:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, "rubric" isn't too obscure, not like "copacetic" or something, but hardly a common word, no.

[14:20:00.0000] <daedb>
rubrik = headline

[14:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's pretty similar to the English meaning.

[14:20:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I can assure you that "rubric" is too obscure.

[14:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, yes, I wasn't really serious.

[14:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although people can just memorize it as gibberish, you know.

[14:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd prefer to minimize the amount of gibberish in the language, especially gibberish that looks like it should be a word.

[14:21:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Works well for some existing elements that are abbreviations that most HTML authors probably don't remember.

[14:21:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
<div> and <span> are more or less gibberish.

[14:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Less gibberish than "rubric".

[14:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
rubric is only slightly less gibberish than fltcap

[14:22:02.0000] <cardona507>
Philip` - I will gladly try :)  - I haven't tried SVG before - will it be in code or is it something I do in Illustrator?

[14:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
cardona507: It can be either!  SVG is fun to code by hand.

[14:23:01.0000] <daedb>
div = various crap

[14:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Ah it should have been called <vcrap>

[14:39:00.0000] <webster42>
Hi there folks, anybody on?

[14:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nope, we're all gone.

[14:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not here either

[14:43:01.0000] <webster42>
:P

[14:44:00.0000] <webster42>
So, I've been following along casually for years and I've decided I want to really get into HTML5 stuff and push the envelope 

[14:44:01.0000] <webster42>
I have a feeling in 2010 it's going to start finally becoming more and more popular 

[14:45:00.0000] <webster42>
am I off-base/too-early? 

[14:45:01.0000] <webster42>
do you guys know a couple of impressive examples (real sites) that use the new functionality? 

[14:50:00.0000] <cardona507>
wow - svg is a trip

[14:52:00.0000] <cardona507>
webster42 - google.com uses the HTML5 doctype - if you consider that and impressive site

[14:53:00.0000] <webster42>
cardona507: I don't. It's an impressive company however. :)

[14:53:01.0000] <cardona507>
hehe - true

[14:53:02.0000] <webster42>
what I mean is, have there been any cool webapps yet that take advantage of all of this stuff? (and don't care about IE)

[14:55:00.0000] <cardona507>
Google wave uses some html5 - it's pretty cool - but the spec isn't done yet - so there aren't any killer apps that I am aware of yet

[14:55:01.0000] <webster42>
 I suppose it's pointless to ask about "when will the spec be done-er

[14:55:02.0000] <webster42>
"

[14:55:03.0000] <cardona507>
but quite a bit of the spec is implemented in modern browsers - so if you are creative you can cook up a nice html5 app

[14:56:00.0000] <cardona507>
done.... good question - who wants to field that one?

[14:56:01.0000] <webster42>
alright, well I have to run right now but I'll come back soon and explore this further

[14:56:02.0000] <webster42>
bye for now

[15:09:00.0000] <cardona507>
Philip`:  or tabatkins - now that I have my svg code - how do I view it? Of course I can look at it in AI - but when I make it code and put it online it only looks like code in my browser http://cardonadesigns.com/butt.svg (yeah it says butt tab)

[15:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
cardona507: Your webserver is sending it with a content-type of text/plain.

[15:11:00.0000] <cardona507>
so I need to change htaccess to allow the mime type?

[15:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Make it send as image/svg+xml and it'll work.

[15:15:00.0000] <cardona507>
cool - TabAtkins - it worked 

[15:15:01.0000] <cardona507>
it doesnt scale very gracefully though - 

[15:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It seems to scale fine.  It's just that your viewport isn't scaling.

[15:20:00.0000] <cardona507>
so how does it look in to relation to canvas line cap butt?

[15:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
cardona507: It looks similar.  Is there supposed to be some fuzzing on the edges, or is that just an artifact of me scaling up the png?

[15:26:00.0000] <cardona507>
there aren't supposed to be fuzzy edges 

[15:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay, then they look roughly the same, modulo some slight color differences and positioning changes.

[15:27:01.0000] <cardona507>
yeah - but the first was a png and the second was svg -

[15:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes?

[15:27:03.0000] <cardona507>
nm - Philip`  asked me to redo my png as svg and I was asking for feedback

[15:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What I meant is, I see a black rectangle partially overlapping a bluish rectangle in both.

[15:29:00.0000] <cardona507>
and do you think that is an appropriate graphic for the part about linecap="butt" ? 

[15:32:00.0000] <cardona507>
section 4.8.11.1.5

[15:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
cardona507: Looks reasonable to me :-)

[15:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, seems fine.

[15:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think it's nice to have these things in SVG partly since scalability is good (particularly when printing) and partly because it's good to have in an editable format

[15:37:01.0000] <cardona507>
cool - I"ll make the other 2 correct and in svg - do you recommend that I do any future graphics for the spec in svg?

[15:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
so someone can make further changes without having to start from scratch

[15:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
(though I think the spec still needs a PNG fallback for obsolete browsers, like IE8)

[15:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd prefer SVG, but my opinion has no particular weight so there's no reason to take it into account :-)

[15:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, when I pointed out a Unicode character that didn't render on Firefox/Chrome on the latest Ubuntu, Ian told me to get better fonts and didn't change the text.  So to heck with fallbacks?  :)

[15:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You *should* get better fonts, though.

[15:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Given that Microsoft people have asked questions about canvas, and assuming that Microsoft people use IE, there would be practical benefits to having fallbacks for those diagrams

[15:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's not a good assumption.

[15:46:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, probably.

[15:46:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
From what I know.

[15:46:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, seriously?

[15:46:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
You know people on the IE team who don't use IE as their primary browser?

[15:46:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[15:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Can you name names, or is this secret?

I thought that bug was out of fashion

[16:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Apparently, since no one quit.

[17:31:00.0000] <jcranmer>
there are people still affected by it

[17:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, people who for some reason refuse to upgrade

[17:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithXX: can't check in the html5 spec changes

[17:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmithXX: it's still blocked

[17:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It just randomly occurred to me that you could avoid compatibility problems and still encourage Flash to die by using <video> as fallback for Flash, instead of the other way around.

[17:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So your site still works even if Flash isn't installed, even if not quite how you'd like it.

[18:02:00.0000] <cardona507>
interesting thought ---- the part about encouraging flash to die that is :)

[18:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I should say, your site might still work if Flash isn't installed.

[18:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Membership "query failed"?

[18:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, did you get an answer about criteria for splitting other features out of the spec?

[19:07:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
Hixie: sorry, I'm talking a look at it again now

[19:08:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
*taking

[19:14:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
I can find no lock files in the corresponding directories in filesystem for the cvs server

[19:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I note that the WG decision about microdata fails to mention that the "significant deployment success" of RDFa isn't always real RDFa, just something that looks like it

[19:21:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Does that mean XHTML has had significant success with people using an XHTML doctype, but still non-well-formed and served as text/html?

[20:08:00.0000] <karlcow>
http://coolreader.org/crengine.htm

[20:08:01.0000] <karlcow>
CREngine is an open source E-Book viewer library development project.

2 different DOM tree implementations

http://raphaeljs.com/gear.html

[21:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: yeah, basically the criteria for keeping it was "is it mature, has it been successful in the market, and is it something that could not be reused in other specs", based on http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/att-0218/issue-76-decision.html

[21:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Part of me would love to see what happened if someone decided to apply those criteria to the entire spec

[22:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: what's up with the w3c cvs server?

[22:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
not sure, MikeSmithXX said he'd look into it

[22:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it picked a bad time to pitch a fit

[22:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but then, I guess it's always a bad time

[22:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, I posted a CfC to publish the new document

[22:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's been refusing changes for a few days

[22:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
might as well put one out for http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/html5/2dcontext/Overview.html?content-type=text/html as well

[22:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you ask on the list I'll do it

[22:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
k, will do shortly

[22:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
got some maintenance to do first

[22:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
k

[22:33:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
othermaciej: what's up is that there seems to be a stale lock file for the last 36 hours or so now

[22:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmithXX: ugh

[22:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmithXX: do you have shell access to that machine? should be easy to remove manually if so

[22:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess with the splt out microdata section having he vocabularies in it, we don't need the separate vocab specs any more

[22:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
should i cvs remove them?

[22:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
it'd make my life easier

[22:34:03.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
othermaciej: yeah, I have shell access to the cvs repository, but when I go into the cvs filesystem there, I see all the ,v files but not lock files anywhere

[22:34:04.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
Hixie: yeah, sure

[22:36:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
the messages say that its waiting on a lock for user "www-data", which leads me to believe that the problem is there's a hung cvs process on the dev.w3.org mirror

[22:36:01.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
but I don't have shell access to that machine

[22:37:00.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
as soon as someone for Europe systems team gets on, I think it should get fixed pretty quickly

[22:37:01.0000] <MikeSmithXX>
but I do want to find out for the future what the hell the cause of the problem was

[22:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: do you see any cvs processes running on dev.w3.org?

[22:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
MikeSmith: if you have root you could just kill those maybe

[22:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I can't even remember how cvs does lockfiles

[23:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
othermaciej: I have no shell access to dev.w3.org so can't check ps or top or anything there

[23:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
csv docs say that it uses lock files with "#" prefixes but I find none of those in the repository

[23:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I do find some LOCKS directories but none that correspond to the html5 spec dir

[23:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
weird

[23:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe for the future I can ask for root access to dev.w3.org

[23:24:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
actually, not maybe -- I will ask

[23:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will say that often when I report problems with dev.w3.org, the response I've gotten from systems team is the response to the "Doctor, it hurts when I do this." complaint

[23:26:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I have been told that dev.w3.or was never intended to be a platform for publishing documents, but instead only for making software available

[23:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and that it is underpowered as a publishing server and so we should not be surprised when it has problems

[23:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
to which my response is that we and many others have in fact been using it as a publishing platform for a long while, so maybe it's time we made it work the way it should

[23:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does the w3c have any other way to maintain and track editor's drafts?

[23:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in any case, it seems like a stuck lock is something that should just be fixed

[23:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: what happens when you ask "so what are we supposed to use for public version control of editor's drafts?"?

[23:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: what is the about:blank synchronicity in HTML5 based on?

[23:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: that is, which engine did you reverse engineer?

[23:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
everyone does it and pages depend on it, iirc

[23:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Gecko does something in that direction but not exactly

[23:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: see http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.platform/msg/9853d685c3fc9652

[23:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i saw that earlier

[23:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm happy to make the spec say whatever the browser vendors are willing to implement

[23:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
(as far as this goes)

[23:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I guess I'll have to ask Boris to state what that is

[23:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't understand the docshell well enough

[23:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
it would be ideal if you could get the webkit guys on board as well

[23:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
when i talk to them they seem to take this about:blank-is-synchronous thing pretty seriously

[23:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is about:blank loading in WebKit really truly synchronous always?

[23:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
as in: does the about:blank DOM always get created without a trip through the event loop when a browsing context is created or navigated to about:blank?

[23:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
how do the events fire?

[23:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
dunno, test it

[23:47:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I have to write a pure-HTML test for this

[23:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Mozilla has tests that use a XUL harness

[23:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and the tests run in the same XUL harness so that when the events break, it's hard to see what broke

[00:30:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: lock file cleared

[00:31:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you should be able to commit now

[00:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[00:31:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
sorry for the ridiculously long delay

[00:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
no worries

[00:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I will try to get root access to that server so I can get it fixed quickly if/when it happens again

[00:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me sees a new postmsg subdir

[00:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: i'm hitting 500s on pms

[00:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries staggering the requests a bit

[01:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: That sounds bad. Is it timing out or just being really slow?

[01:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
it was actually returning 500s. i staggered my requests and it worked ok

[01:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
i was probably just hammering it too hard

[01:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, four specs that size of html5 all at once will do that

[01:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Oh I thought you were talking about a time of 500s not a response code of 500

[01:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh heh

[01:38:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
<caption> is not usable anywhere

[01:38:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
it's dropped completely outside tables

[01:39:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
and is clusterfucked inside tables

[01:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan__: even in the right place in tables?

[01:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I assume he means for use with <figure>

[01:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ah

[01:40:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
yes

way to go for still finding energy to put into that rathole

[01:50:00.0000] <annevk>
should it say a little more than 2D Context?

[01:50:01.0000] <annevk>
e.g. 2D Graphics Context

[01:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
What's the MPEG-U thing? Is MPEG forking a time-frozen snapshot of the Platform for consumer electronics?

[01:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: *shrug*

[01:53:00.0000] <annevk>
mkay, someone else will argue that for me at some point then

[01:53:01.0000] <annevk>
and if not I guess 2D Context works...

[01:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[01:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, AIUI, MPEG-U is some Widgets related thing

[01:54:02.0000] <Lachy>
other than that, I don't know much about it

[01:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
From the graphic, it seems the MPEG part replaces HTML (or browsers) in the architecture

[02:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok bed time now

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
"early" meeting tomorrow

[02:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[02:16:03.0000] <gsnedders>
"early" == before 12?

[02:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe MPEG-U is related to CE-HTML

[02:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, or maybe not

[02:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anybody know roughly how long it take to build GTK+ on a normal machine?

[02:27:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I have a build running and wondering if I should wait for it finish or go get something to eat and come back later

[02:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: It took 1301 seconds to compile on my machine

[02:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: ah OK

[02:35:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
thanks

[02:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me now tries to remember when he started the build

[02:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
(That's the first time I've ever used Gentoo's emerge.log)

[02:39:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: is there a word in Finnish that sounds anything like "roryu" or "loryu" ?

[02:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
something to do with a type of sauna?

[02:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hmm, it seems Finnish löyly becomes ロウリュウ (roryuu) in Japanese

[03:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What are the major types of non-browser user agents that use and respect mime types?

[04:03:00.0000] <annevk>
no hostile questions

[04:08:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: MPEG-U: What you said, and proprietary extensions

[04:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
see http://concolato.blog.telecom-paristech.fr/widgets/mpeg-u/

[04:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
annevk: How do I phrase it less hostile?

[04:11:00.0000] <virtuelv>
note that the widget specification makes it possible to ship, say, windows executables, and still conform to the spec

[04:11:01.0000] <annevk>
phrasing it less doesn't make it less :p

[04:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm still wondering, though. Magic numbers and file extensions seem quite popular.

[04:12:01.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: except, it doesn't seem time-frozen

[04:12:02.0000] <virtuelv>
at least not based on the spec linked from that page

[04:13:00.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, I can't really think of anything

[04:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: thanks

[04:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: widget specs allowing Windows executables doesn't seem quite nice

[04:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: email apps deciding between text/plain, text/enriched, text/html (and maybe text/rtf?) email bodies for rendering

[04:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, that's a good one. Email probably has more reliable labeling too.

[04:15:01.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: P&C is a packaging format specification

[04:15:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: for message bodies maybe. I'd expect attachment labeling to be semirandom

[04:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: but I don't know

[04:16:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: i've skimmed to the end of that MPEG-U spec now, it also seems to be a user-agent specification and interaction via DLNA

[04:16:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Attachments probably get by on having a filename

[04:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders who actually runs a DLNA network at home

[04:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
attaching a small computer to a TV seems like a more versatile and reliable solution

[04:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
SVN uses MIME types to determine text vs binary - does that count?

[04:18:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: All of this is coming, like it or not

[04:18:01.0000] <virtuelv>
http://www.opera.com/business/solutions/devices/tv/

[04:18:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Not much, if it's just a "starts with text/ or doesn't" check

[04:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Although I suppose if the mime-type is stored, then applications accessing the svn repo might use the mime-type for useful things

[04:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Many web crawlers look at MIME types to work out whether they've got an HTML file they should parse and explore, or another file they should index in other ways

[04:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders how seriously consumer electronics are going to handle security updates

[04:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Browsers accessing the SVN web interface use the mime-type for useful things :-)

[04:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
Not sure about other client programs, though

[04:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Depends on how seriously they take consumers bricking their devices on botched firmware upgrades?

[04:22:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: I dunno, but my TV has upgradable firmware

[04:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: I don't know if TV vendors are more concerned with bricking or delivering timely updates for cross-Origin security holes

[04:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
(I suppose hijacking local files is a bit less of an issue on TVs)

[04:22:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if there's statistics on how many people upgrade firmware

[04:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'd assume it's about 0%, in cases where it's not entirely automatic)

[04:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
especially when one's foremost expectation is that firmware updates *remove* functionality by blacklisting leaked DRM keys

[04:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I assume Sony keeps statistics on firmware updates, because the manual said they reserve the right to track the MAC ids of network-connected TVs

[04:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(or something along those lines; I've never connected a Sony TV to a network)

[04:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
I assume that TVs will have mandatory auto updates when connected to a network

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders where Sony, Samsung, etc. expect end users to obtain their MPEG-4 in non-standard container video files for DLNA viewing

[04:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
From their proprietary online stores?

[04:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
do they have online stores where one can buy Matroska files without DRM?

[04:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if bugmail arrives late or if Hixie kept fixing bugs past his announced bed time

[05:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, firmware updates that remove leaked DRM keys are, IIRC, somewhat forced upon users when they insert discs produced and bought after the blacklisting.

[05:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
so if a disc says the device's key isn't valid, it won't be able to play the disc without a firmware upgrade

[05:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: ah. I don't really know how this works.

[05:20:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok, here's a brief summary:

[05:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I was thinking of HDCP over HDMI stopping to support a picture source

[05:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it would suck pretty badly if one's video card stopped interoperating with a TV because the TV downloaded a blacklist with the GPU on it

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
due to the GPU having gotten cracked elsewhere 

[05:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or something like that

[05:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hardware vendors for blu-ray players are issued device keys that are stored somewhere in the firmware, usually in a way that's difficult for end users to access.

[05:22:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't even know what the threat scenarios are here

[05:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
The blu-ray discs have information on them pertaining to the set of keys that are valid. (This isn't just a simple list, it uses some complicated mathematics that I won't even try to explain)

[05:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
The AACS have a way to blacklist device keys by altering that information on future discs

[05:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: does this affect the HDCP hop in any way?

[05:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: does the TV and the Blu-Ray player need to be updated in sync or something like that?

[05:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't believe so. If the player is able to decode and play the disc, the HDCP is a separate encryption step

[05:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I'm not an expert on this and my summary was an overly simplified summary

[05:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, this DRM stuff isn't a good background for motivating users to approve the installation of browser or Flash updates to their TVs

[05:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
I've never had a TV that could accept firmware updates, and until it was mentioned a few minutes ago, it didn't occur to me that anyone would do it.

[05:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I have one that could accept updates, but the TV works now as a display for a Mac Mini, so I haven't taken any chances with updates

[05:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I've never tried the built-in networking or the widget engine on the TV

[05:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me vaguely remembers an explanation that the complicated mathematics is kind of like there's a binary tree with device keys as leafs, and the disc can contain a set of keys corresponding to nodes in the tree, where each node key can be combined with a device key in a subtree of that node, in order to decode the disc

[05:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
in fact, I've never even connected it to a TV antenna cord

[05:30:03.0000] <Philip`>
and so the first discs just need a key at the root node, and later you can blacklist any arbitrary device key by only giving node keys at the nodes that aren't its ancestors (i.e. by giving O(depth of tree) keys)

[05:30:04.0000] <Philip`>
which seems like a clever approach

[05:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me has never had a TV that required updates but does have a Wii that does (and sometimes has mandatory updates)

[05:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
(and a Wii and a TV are about the same level of consuer hardware as far as I'm concerned)

[05:32:01.0000] <jgraham>
*consumer

[05:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
mandatory updates when DRM is involved can be a real pain. I've been affected by Spotify's mandatory DRM updates, which wouldn't allow me to play my songs on my iphone till I upgraded the spotify app

[05:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's what made me decide to stop paying for spotify

[05:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me hasn't had any problems with spotify

[05:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
(from that point of view)

[05:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
(although I don't have an iPhone or anything fancy)

[05:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I haven't really used Spotify on S60 after installing it

[05:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I generally don't listen to music while mobile

[05:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does XML make it possible to introduce carriage returns in PI data?

[05:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't see how that would be possible

[05:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
"To simplify the tasks of applications, the XML processor MUST behave as if it normalized all line breaks in external parsed entities (including the document entity) on input, before parsing, by translating both the two-character sequence #xD #xA and any #xD that is not followed by #xA to a single #xA character."

[05:40:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I can't see any way past that

[05:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and NCRs aren't supported in PIs

[05:56:00.0000] <zcorpan_>
Hixie: the boxes on whatwg.org could benefit from some border-radius

[06:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: make it also a double border so that WebKit has more reason to gets its anti-aliasing act together with double-line rounded corners

[06:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://sleeptalkinman.blogspot.com/

[06:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
I started working on the change proposals for figure and details. http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Change_Proposal:_figure_and_details

[06:57:00.0000] <annevk>
details was removed from the spec

[06:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, when?

[06:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's still in the complete.html version

[06:58:01.0000] <annevk>
this morning

[07:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, this is going to be confusing if the W3C HTML5 gets so out of sync with the WHATWG copy

[07:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
gotta love the Web: document.write("<noscript>");

[07:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Just make your change proposal say that details should be added back to HTML5

[07:10:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
hsivonen: oh yeah 3px double border with border-radius looks pretty ugly in webkit

[07:10:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
http://simon.html5.org/sandbox/html/video/ now has a double border

[07:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, it's pretty much the same as document.write('<!--'), I guess?

[07:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/issues/detail?id=105

[07:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: holy crap

[07:23:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
what do people think about http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8490 ?

[07:31:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
same-origin scripts don't need postMessage at all to communicate

[07:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: technically in the same ballpark, but I think writing a <noscript> from a script is conceptually weirder

[07:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No argument on that.

[07:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
Details got removed? Sigh. Do I have to write a change proposal or something to get it back?

[07:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or can we get it back as part of the dd/dt thing without a seperate change proposal

[07:49:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me is confused

[07:50:00.0000] <adactio>
I too am confused by the sudden death of details.

[07:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe I have to first file a bug to revert the change made by the other bug and then eventually write a change proposal? 

[07:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I think you can object to the resolution of the existing bug first

[07:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
and then escelate it

[07:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
*escalate

[07:56:03.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Sounds plausible.

[07:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Details was cute, but I don't think it was more than marginally useful.

[07:57:01.0000] <jgraham>
Does anyone have a link to the procedures document offhand?

[07:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/decision-policy.html

[07:57:03.0000] <Lachy>
so I think the first step is to reopen http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8379 and provide rationale

[07:57:04.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: I find myself wanting it really often and having to go to script just to get a disclosure triangle is overkill

[07:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: as I read that, it is technically only the "commenter" (i.e. the bug filer" who should reopen bugs)

[08:00:00.0000] <adactio>
Details would have been enormously useful to me. It's a pattern I use all the time with JavaScript.

[08:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Expando sections are a very common idiom on the web, and great for information accessiblity.

[08:00:02.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: (that might be a bug in the document though, I will check with othermaciej)

[08:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: how do you avoid poisoning browser-native <details>?

[08:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
hsivonen: What do you mean?

[08:16:01.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: well, I haven't actually used the <details> element itself but I imagine it wouldn't be too tricky to test for native support in JavaScript (in a similar way to checking for native input types).

[08:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's not difficult.  <details> has an open method you can test for.

[08:17:00.0000] <adactio>
As I said, it's the *pattern* that I use all the time. It would be nice to see such a common pattern move from a scripted to a declarative solution (much like all those new input types).

[08:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: ok

[08:19:00.0000] <daedb>
/me sighs at the removal of <details>

[08:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
TabAtkins: I mean it's perilous to use JS emulation for an HTML5 feature before there's a native impl so you can test your JS impl gets out of the way cleanly

[08:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
hsivonen: Sure, but like I said, there's an easy hook for testing.  document.createElement('details').open should return undefined if it's not natively handled.

[08:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe Shelley's removal bugs don't represent WG consensus

[08:20:02.0000] <Dashiva>
daedb: It hasn't been removed, just moved

[08:20:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hopefully a massively incomplete implementation of <details> won't show up in a public build.

[08:20:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: Political bullshit like moving it to another version of the spec is worse than useless.

[08:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I use <details> right now with the .open testing on a few intranet sites.

[08:21:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Political bullshit doesn't disappear just because we know it's bullshit

[08:22:00.0000] <adactio>
Wait. Wait. Wait. Is <details> in HTML5 or not?

[08:22:01.0000] <brucel>
I added a request to un-kill details Found this the other day by clicking the tabs at the top of labs.opera.com and wondered if you minded if I give it a spring clean to mention HTML5, widgets, mobile best practices etc.

[08:22:02.0000] <brucel>
I saw " Opera provides experimental support for some types of Compound Documents, leading this work which is still in development at W3C with practical implementations that people can use." and had to look up Compound Documents - is this something still actively used today (and I'm too thick to have heard of it?)

[08:22:03.0000] <brucel>
Would it be useful to have something on this page that talks about our policy with patents, too? Eg, lift some text from http://www.opera.com/company/vision/

[08:22:04.0000] <brucel>
 We believe in a patent-free Web.

[08:22:05.0000] <gsnedders>
adactio: not

[08:22:06.0000] <brucel>
Opera Software does not believe innovation in the software industry is protected or encouraged by software patents. In particular, we believe interoperability on the Internet should be encouraged, and we actively work to ensure that software patents do not stand in the way of interoperability.

[08:22:07.0000] <brucel>
As a highly innovative company, Opera Software comes up with many ideas and concepts that are patentable. In some situations, we will apply for software patents as a way to protect ourselves from attacks by other aggressive patent holders.

[08:22:08.0000] <brucel>
I added a comment in the bug tracking thang to undelete <details>. Dunno what the proper process is... the fact that Shelley had filed a bug to kill it had passed me by or I'd;'ve protested before it was drowned in a bucket

[08:22:09.0000] <Dashiva>
adactio: It is in WHATWG HTML, not HTML5

[08:22:10.0000] <brucel>
ooops pasted from wrong clipboard

[08:22:11.0000] <brucel>
sorry

[08:22:12.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guessed that

[08:22:13.0000] <TabAtkins>
But it's useless political bullshit.  It's not like anyone's going to be appeased by <details> being removed, and somehow drop the other section-removal requests.

[08:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Appeasement is the rule of law, though

[08:23:01.0000] <brucel>
I added a comment in the bug tracking thang to undelete <details>. Dunno what the proper process is... the fact that Shelley had filed a bug to kill it had passed me by or I'd;'ve protested before it was drowned in a bucket

[08:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, I keep deleting my emails because I think they probably won't add anything to the discussion.

[08:24:02.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: They probably won't

[08:24:03.0000] <jgraham>
Most of the emails people do send don't

[08:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but it's at least making me happy writing them.  It's just frustrating that I keep having to stop myself before I hit "Send" and hit "Discard" instead.

[08:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I hate not responding to trolls, even if I know that all they want is to be fed.  >_<  Wrong On The Internet syndrome.

[08:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: You should set up an anonymous blog and post them there

[08:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Last week in TabAtkins' outbox

[08:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
You could post them to wikileaks

[08:26:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hehe.

[08:26:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's a good anonymous blog name, Dashiva.

[08:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
You could hide them in the middle of Jonas Brothers clips on Youtube

[08:26:05.0000] <Dashiva>
TabAtkins: Okay, call yourself "Fake TabAtkins" then

[08:26:06.0000] <Dashiva>
Nobody will suspect a thing

[08:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh man, dynamite plan.

[08:38:00.0000] <adactio>
I am utterly confused by the WHATWG site now. This page: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/ links to "HTML5" latest draft, but when I go there I'm told I'm reading "WHATWG HTML (Including HTML5)."

[08:38:01.0000] <annevk>
utterly confused or you think you discovered a bug? :)

[08:38:02.0000] <Dashiva>
That page is greatly out of date

[08:40:00.0000] <annevk>
it should prolly redirect to http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_various_versions_of_the_spec.3F

[08:40:01.0000] <annevk>
and that entry should be moved out of HTML5

[08:40:02.0000] <annevk>
I guess the whole FAQ needs an update to take into account new realities

[08:40:03.0000] <annevk>
oh well, maybe for when I'm back

[08:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Re <details>: I realize it's very common, but there are zillions of common things people use JS for.  Why should we add this one to HTML and not all the others?

[08:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me will now be challenged to provide examples, which he'll be forced to come up with off the top of his head, so they'll be easily shot down and everyone else will smugly claim victory.

[08:43:00.0000] <adactio>
So, just to get this straight in my own head: there is no longer a spec named HTML5 at the WHATWG. There is a spec named HTML5 at the W3C. There is a WHATWG spec named HTML.

[08:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: at least a while ago, whatwg.org also had a document that corresponded to W3C HTML5

[08:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It still does

[08:45:00.0000] <adactio>
I'm doing my damndest to evangelise HTML5 to front end developers and designers but you guys don't make it easy.

[08:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think the idea is that HTML is a constantly evolving language

[08:46:00.0000] <adactio>
Sheesh! And I thought the W3C was bureaucratic and Kafkaesque.

[08:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
"HTML5" is a snapshot of that language (in terms of features)

[08:46:02.0000] <cardona507>
adactio - http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/html5/ 

[08:46:03.0000] <Philip`>
The W3C process is designed around snapshots, so the HTML WG is trying to develop and publish HTML5

[08:46:04.0000] <cardona507>
thats the one you want - it is textually identical to the w3c spec

[08:47:00.0000] <daedb>
I'm just wondering how many more features/sections will be (re)moved before HTML5 is little more than a prettier version of HTML4.

[08:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
The WHATWG doesn't really have a process, so it's mainly doing HTML (which is the HTML5 snapshot plus extra features)

[08:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: I think Hixie said when W3C HTML5 efforts started that WHATWG HTML would remain a superset of W3C HTML5 if the W3C went into the weeds

[08:47:03.0000] <adactio>
So there is no multi-page version of HTML5 on the WHATWG site? There is a multipage version of a spec called HTML (which includes HTML5) but only one version of HTML5.

[08:47:04.0000] <Philip`>
(but there is a WHATWG copy of the HTML5 document, for people who prefer its licensing or colours)

[08:47:05.0000] <cardona507>
adactio - check http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/html5/

[08:47:06.0000] <cardona507>
its the one you want

[08:47:07.0000] <Philip`>
adactio: Yes

[08:48:00.0000] <adactio>
cardona507: mult-page, please?

[08:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
The WHATWG doesn't have a multipage version of that, only of the superset language

[08:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyone know if Moz intends to implement the RDFa DOM API when that is spec'd?

[08:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
though it should be easy for someone to run the multipager tool on the HTML5 document if they want

[08:49:03.0000] <cardona507>
adactio - there isn't a whatwg multipage version - but here is the w3c multipag http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/spec.html

[08:49:04.0000] <Philip`>
(and publish it somewhere for anyone who wants it)

[08:50:00.0000] <cardona507>
*multipage

[08:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: apparently, the WG decision to remove Microdata triggered the pre-announced weeds protocol

[08:51:00.0000] <adactio>
For. Fuck's. Sake. As if this stuff wasn't confusing enough for authors already. Now they have to put up with stupid spec obfuscation for the sake of some minor semantic victory for someone somewhere.

[08:51:01.0000] <adactio>
Priority of constituencies, my arse.

[08:52:00.0000] <adactio>
The WHATWG couldn't make the spec more author-unfriendly if they tried.

[08:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The spec isn't meant to be friendly to typical authors, it's meant to be precise.

[08:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can't have an easy-to-use spec that's precise.

[08:52:03.0000] <Philip`>
Don't blame the WHATWG, blame Hixie :-)

[08:52:04.0000] <adactio>
Ha! "spec," I said. As if there were just one.

[08:52:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
They're all subsets of the HTML Complete spec.

[08:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you can just use that one if you want.

[08:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: there is just one: Complete

[08:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some people complained the spec was too big.

[08:53:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
And are still complaining the spec is too big.

[08:53:04.0000] <cardona507>
one spec to rule them all - and one spec to bind them....

[08:53:05.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should make a Venn diagram of all the spec documents

[08:53:06.0000] <adactio>
AryehGregor: the design principles would seem to indicate to me that the spec is supposed to be easy to use (as well as precise).

[08:53:07.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: looks like Hixie can't do what you like and what Shelley likes at the same time :-(

[08:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
adactio, no, the features it specifies are supposed to be easy to use.  It's not meant for ordinary authors to use it to learn HTML, you can't do that and be a good reference at the same time.

[08:54:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
People will still need separate tutorials to actually learn how to use HTML, unless they're crazy spec-reading people like us.

[08:54:02.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: I didn't realise that I was supposed to the bug tracker as my own personal bitching space. There are plenty of things I question in HTML5, but I would never file my personal issues as "bugs": I take them to the list for discussion.

[08:54:03.0000] <hsivonen>
now HTML5 is something for everyone: a series of small hard-to-track specs or one big cross-referenced thing

[08:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
adactio, Shelley likes to use the bug tracker instead of mailing lists.

[08:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, she likes to raise every quibble she has as a tracker issue.

[08:55:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Apparently to ensure that things are properly discussed by the whole bureaucratic W3C procedure.

[08:55:03.0000] <Philip`>
The bug tracker is the only way to guarantee a response within the HTML WG

[08:55:04.0000] <adactio>
AryehGregor: Yeah, I've noticed.

[08:55:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rather than, you know, saying it doesn't matter and so who cares, let's just let the editor do what he feels like.

[08:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And the issue tracker is the only way to force a non-technical solution...

[08:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or a technical one the editor doesn't agree with.

[08:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
The issue tracker is the only way to get a solution that differs with the conclusions that Hixie reaches based on the available evidence

[08:59:00.0000] <adactio>
I understand why all this childish splitting of specs is going on (HTML, HTML5, whatever) but this isn't just about the WHATWG and the W3C. It's harmful to authors trying to understand this stuff. Why bother publicly publishing this stuff at all if it's going to be made as confusing as possible to figure out exactly what is published where.

[08:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. for people who have different priorities

[08:59:02.0000] <adactio>
If one person can use the issue tracker to sabotage a specification, I'd say there's a problem with the process.

[09:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
adactio: It's not exactly a secret that there's a problem with w3c process

[09:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
adactio: please let the chairs know

[09:00:02.0000] <cardona507>
its not super confusibg - if u wanna follow HTML5 - go to http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/spec.html

[09:00:03.0000] <adactio>
hsivonen: I feel that might be somewhat like pissing in the wind.

[09:00:04.0000] <cardona507>
*confusing

[09:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
adactio: In any case, authors will likely agree with one side. Deletionists will use the W3C drafts, Inclusionists will use WHATWG's :)

[09:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
adactio, most people here aren't big fans of the W3C.  They're only involved for political reasons: name-brand recognition, patent policies, better chance of MS participation, etc.

[09:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
By all means, complain to the chairs.

[09:01:03.0000] <adactio>
cardona507: I've been pointing interested people to the nice short URL http://whatwg.org/html5 ...which no longer points to a specification called HTML5. It's fucking Orwellian.

[09:01:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
And/or the Director.

[09:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
adactio: I'm sure the redirect could be updated

[09:02:01.0000] <webben>
daedb: I don't have a strong opinion about multiple-vs-single specs, but at least "a prettier [better defined] version of HTML4" is still a worthwhile deliverable.

[09:02:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
adactio, most of us probably agree with you, not much point complaining to us.

[09:02:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least on some aspects.

[09:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If it were up to the WHATWG, there'd probably be only one spec, called just "HTML", except maybe you could access it split into several pieces if you preferred.

[09:03:01.0000] <daedb>
webben: Sure, but it's just getting more and more watered-down to the point where it's getting less and less interesting to authors.

[09:03:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or maybe it would still be called HTML5, just it would evolve over time anyway.

[09:03:03.0000] <Dashiva>
That would drive the versioning fans nuts :)

[09:04:00.0000] <annevk>
it'd prolly be still called web apps 1.0

[09:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
adactio: Would you prefer to point people at the spec that is stable and feature-frozen at version 5, or the version that is continually evolving with experiental new features?

[09:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
daedb, I don't really agree with that at all.  The big stuff is <video>, <audio>, <canvas>, things like that.  <details> and kin are sugar at best.

[09:04:03.0000] <Dashiva>
<video> isn't an unlikely candidate for removal...

[09:04:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't sure which authors would want

[09:04:05.0000] <webben>
daedb: Most of the authorship is not interested in specs anyway. <video> being on MDC or in Mark's Dive Into book, for instance, is more important than which of W3C's/WHATWG's docs it sits in.

[09:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It seems to fail many of the same criteria as microdata did

[09:05:01.0000] <webben>
(I think)

[09:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, I was going to point that out.

[09:05:03.0000] <adactio>
I would like to point people at the spec called HTML5. If the WHATWG want to have an ongoing internal masterspec called HTML that's fine, but it shouldn't take precedence over what authors are interested in reading i.e. the current spec.

[09:05:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The only thing that differs is it has no competitor.

[09:06:00.0000] <webben>
adactio: "current" meaning what?

[09:06:01.0000] <Dashiva>
adactio: That misrepresents authors' real needs

[09:06:02.0000] <webben>
adactio: isn't "current" the "ongoing" spec?

[09:06:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
adactio, both specs are current.  One matches the current W3C version, the other is more inclusive.

[09:06:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Authors don't care about what's in spec X or Y, they care about what they can use here and now

[09:06:05.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: The (non-trivial part of the) canavs element has already been moved into a separate spec, so I guess that's not in HTML5 now either

[09:06:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Authors will want the complete HTML spec as soon as there's one feature in it that they can actually use that's not in HTML5.

[09:06:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
(currently the differences are very minor)

[09:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Addendum: Not just what they can use, they also want to give input on future features, of course. But future features are future features whether they're in HTML5 or not

[09:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
(http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8331)

[09:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders if his ISP is blocking outgoing SMTP

[09:08:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Looks like the microdata rationale is being reused)

[09:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh, maybe Hixie's literally going to split everything that's not widely used and could be used from other specs into a separate spec.

[09:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would create quite a lot more specs, but hey, it's what the chairs seem to want.

[09:10:00.0000] <itpastorn>
In what way has CSS3 been hurt by modularization?

[09:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
itpastorn: How many CSS3 modules are CR or PR?

[09:10:02.0000] <adactio>
I realise that my anger is probably misplaced here. I understand *why* this silly spec-splitting is going on—it's driven by forces outside the WHATWG. But from my perspective, which is primarily as an evangelist, it makes it really bloody hard to explain this mess to my peers.

[09:10:03.0000] <daedb>
AryehGregor: Sure, but when all the sugar is removed the spec becomes boring for everyone who doesn't publish videos or use canvas.

[09:11:00.0000] <adactio>
With that, I will leave you in peace.

[09:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
daedb, the goal is to be useful, not exciting.

[09:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
adactio, just point them all to the complete HTML spec at the WHATWG.

[09:11:03.0000] <Dashiva>
adactio: In a more constructive effort, were there any other issues than the specs page missing links, and the html5 redirect being wrong?

[09:11:04.0000] <daedb>
AryehGregor: Sugar is useful.

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
daedb: It's not useful for people who use canvas either, since the 2D context was removed, so it's boring for even more people

[09:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
daedb, by definition, only marginally.

[09:12:02.0000] <adactio>
Dashiva: the WHATWG spec page needs a cleanup ...but I believe this a known issue.

[09:13:00.0000] <itpastorn>
@dashiva: A few more than if we'd have to wait for the rest! (http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work)

[09:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
itpastorn: Marquee and mobile are high profile, how usefulu

[09:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wouldn't be surprised if the rationale was to just give people what they're asking for, and letting them choke on it.  It's bs, but whatever.

[09:16:00.0000] <itpastorn>
Dashiva: And what has that got to do with my argument?

[09:16:01.0000] <Dashiva>
itpastorn: More politely, modularization makes it much easier to say "You go do your thing while we do our thing" 

[09:16:02.0000] <Dashiva>
So the overall priorities are lost

[09:17:00.0000] <CriticalMass>
first post - enthusiasm zeroed - and it's the likes of me you're supposed to be talking at

[09:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(It also means entire modules can go untouched by good spec developers because those are busy with a dozen other modules)

[09:20:00.0000] <itpastorn>
That would probably happen anyway, even if it was parts of one behemoth CSS 3 super spec - and none of it would have been anything more than a Working Draft. Nothing!

[09:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Except it wouldn't be a behemoth

[09:21:01.0000] <daedb>
AryehGregor: It's subjective, the sugar is much more useful than the big features like video for some author classes.

[09:21:02.0000] <Dashiva>
When it's all there in the same place, it's much easier to say "Okay, that's enough, let's make this work first"

[09:22:00.0000] <itpastorn>
But we will never agree on what's enough. 

[09:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
A little too much or a little too little works too

[09:25:00.0000] <itpastorn>
I think you are missing my point. It is better to move small chunks to a standard that requires implementation.

[09:25:01.0000] <itpastorn>
What if TCP/IP had been one single spec, including ARP, DHCP, BGP, EIGRP, CIDR, etc?

[09:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Maybe we could have had less acronyms then…

[09:27:00.0000] <itpastorn>
That would make my students happy!

[09:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Analogies are like fraternal twins, they aren't really the same at all

[09:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, they're half the same, on average.

[09:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
Each web browser is expected to implement all of CSS3, whereas no software is expected to implement all those IP protocols

[09:29:00.0000] <itpastorn>
You have obviously not heard of an operating system - well perhaps we could say it does not have to implement all routing protocols, but a few hundred others I did not mention instead.

(...as long as you don't consider something like IOS to be a single piece of software)

[09:30:00.0000] <itpastorn>
Which I did, as well as the *nix's and Windoze and the BSD's, etc.

[09:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
The modularity of an OS seems completely different to the modularity of a web browser implementation

[09:34:00.0000] <hober>
itpastorn: it's at best disingenuous to suggest that people here haven't "heard of an operating system," don't you think?

[09:35:00.0000] <itpastorn>
So, if everything a browser is expected to implement, why not have image formats, SVG, MathML and HTTP, FTP... in the spec as well

[09:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because then no currently-existing browser could handle the entire spec.  There are clear technical limitations to how large the spec can be.  ^_^

[09:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/handle/render/

[09:36:02.0000] <itpastorn>
hober: Yes it is. I apologize for those words. They did convey a belittling I am sorry for.

[09:37:00.0000] <itpastorn>
However, this channel is not exactly known for its politeness...

[09:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Fuck you, we're extremely polite.

[09:37:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
^_^

[09:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
itpastorn: It has been suggested more than once, actually

[09:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Meh, who cares, just write the specs.

[09:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Format isn't worth arguing over.

[09:39:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

[09:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
We have one editor who's willing to edit all these specs, and he prefers to edit them as one document, so why not let him?

[09:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If we need to meet some bureaucratic procedure so we can proceed to Candidate Recommendation or whatever, we can split off features then.

[09:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Tons of specs do that.

[09:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
In most other cases, you don't have such insanely active editors, so it's easier to have multiple specs.

[09:47:00.0000] <itpastorn>
Well, that's the downside of doing spec work outside of closed societies.

[09:48:00.0000] <itpastorn>
Or the downside of doing sexy stuff. Who'd like to contribute to this: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5719

[09:49:00.0000] <itpastorn>

[12:04:00.0000] <navap>
Is there a difference between the whatwg and w3c specs for html5?

[12:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
the "whatwg html" spec is a superset of the w3c html5 spec -- it has features that aren't yet in the w3c copy, like <device>, and it puts everything in one document instead of several

[12:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
(the whatwg currently also has an "html5" spec that's identical to the w3c "core and vocabulary" one, but i think that's just causing confusion so i might just drop it)

[12:06:01.0000] <navap>
So which is this one? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/

[12:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's the "whatwg html" spec, which is the "latest version" of html, with more features than html5.

[12:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Plural?

[12:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
<device> and <details>, currently

[12:10:00.0000] <navap>
Okay so http://whatwg.org/html and http://whatwg.org/html5 both point to the same document which is the HTML+HTML5 spec, and then there is also http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/html5/ which is just the HTML5 spec?

[12:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[12:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think i'll drop the latter one though

[12:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
as it is just causing confusion

[12:23:00.0000] <navap>
Shouldn't the examples given here have their p elements closed at the end of each line? http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#conversations

[12:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
</p> is optional in HTML

[12:24:00.0000] <navap>
Whereas in XHTML it isn't?

[12:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
XHTML requires all start and end tags to be explicit

[12:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
whereas HTML has special cases so some tags can be omitted

[12:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i'm not convinced the changes to the FAQ actually made matters better.. in particular, i think the IETF might take offence, for instance, at being described as part of the W3C HTML WG.

[12:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
also Web SQL Database isn't deprecated

[15:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is dev.w3.org still horked?

[15:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just sent out the FPWD request i meant to send out last night for 2dcontext

[15:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i threw in the other drafts while i was at it

[15:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
dev.w3.org seems to work ok except for some reason there's a bit of a delay sometimes

[15:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html doesn't reflect what's in CVS

[15:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is the intro useful as a spec by itself? it doesn't seem to include anything normative, and the link to the modules probably isn't suitable for the TR page

[15:58:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hello hello. :D

[15:59:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Anyone here using WYSIWYG editors and HTML5?

[15:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: the TR version of that page links to the /TR/ page instead

[15:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
whether it's useful or not is another question

[15:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
i wasn't sure where to put the intro material though

[15:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
so i figured that made the most sense


2010-01-09
[16:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
personally i think the whole splitting spec thing is a waste of time and woul rather we went back to complete.html, but i'm trying to find solutions that work for the htmlwg members

[16:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
indeed, I see you have made a solomonic effort

[16:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the intro seems to relate most to either the core or vocabulary specs, not really sure which

[16:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
core vs. vocabulary ended up kind of a wacky split, since core defines parts of the vocabulary 

[16:06:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I just wanted to know the name of one WYSIWYG editor that supports new HTML5 elements.  CKEditor moves them around like ragdolls and TinyMCE seems to replace them with other elements.

[16:08:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
JonathanNeal: why would you want to handle the new elements with wysiwyg rather than in handwritten templates?

[16:08:01.0000] <cardona507>
hixie - hello -  am working on some graphics for <meter> and I am wondering if user agents will always show it as a small bar with part of it colored in similar to the usenet example that is live in the spec? Or will it sometimes be rendered as a clock other times a thermometer other times a bar etc depending on the situation?

[16:08:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
zcorpan__, there may be instances where I want to create my own section or articles within one inside the wysiwyg

[16:12:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
JonathanNeal: for section, you can use implied section by just using a heading. for article.. why would you want to have a nested article in wysiwyg?

[16:13:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
zcorpan__, while I don't mind getting into those details, they detract from the fact that all new html5 elements fail in the most well known wysiwyg editors and I was wondering if that was a limitation of the browser or the wysiwyg.

[16:15:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
ok. my guess is that the wysiwyg could support them even though they're not known elements in the browser

[16:16:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
and even if they're known elements in the browser, they'd still fail in existing editors

[16:17:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
ok. i checked a few months ago and no one had tried html5 in a wysiwyg then either.

[16:17:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
maybe you could try implementing it yourself :)

[16:18:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I did, a few months ago.

[16:18:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
oh cool

[16:18:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I created various work-arounds that worked enough for us to push to our new site.

[16:18:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Problem is our product is kinda like a cms.

[16:18:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So when they hear our new site is HTML5, they think they can just make HTML5 sites with our product.

[16:19:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And all the support questions are coming to me because I did it, but I'm saying "I hacked the thing up to the point where it works because it ignores the elements in the wysiwyg, because it still does not support them" --- that made me think of pinging this chan again :D

[16:21:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
maybe you could file requests for proper html5 support in popular editors

[16:23:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yea, I've seen it and seen it ignored, but I'll make some noise.

[16:51:00.0000] <cardona507>
any feedback on this for <meter> http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/3571/whatwgmeterex101.png ?

[16:52:00.0000] <cardona507>
I am also creating a thermometer

[16:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[16:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
uh the number of notches on that dial makes no sense :-)

[16:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
you have four in the first bit and three for the rest :-)

[16:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
should be four each time if it's a decimal dial

[16:53:03.0000] <cardona507>
doh :) hehe

[16:53:04.0000] <cardona507>
yeah - that was the intention :)

[16:53:05.0000] <cardona507>
hehe - i'll fix that real quick

[16:53:06.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[17:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok <details> is back

[17:08:00.0000] <cardona507>
ok - I fixed the notches on the dial - http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/3571/whatwgmeterex101.png

[17:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[17:12:00.0000] <cardona507>
thanks

[17:12:01.0000] <daedb>
Nice to see <details> back... there is still hope :)

[17:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
this is #whatwg, so technically <details> never left :-P

[17:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
it only briefly was out of the w3c version of the spec

[17:12:04.0000] <Hixie>
never left the whatwg one

[17:14:00.0000] <daedb>
True, but I want both versions to be nice, not just the Whatwg one ;-p

[17:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
well with the splits and stuff the w3c one is no longer nice :-(

[17:16:00.0000] <daedb>
I don't understand the split out "core" spec... it doesn't contain the elements and syntax sections? I don't get how those are not part of the core of the language...

[17:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
see http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8365 for the reasoning

[17:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
i agree that it doesn't make much sense, i'm just trying to address the bugs that are filed according to the htmlwg process

[17:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I understand some of the motivation for the split but I'm not sure it ended up sensible

[17:19:00.0000] <cardona507>
so the new elements aren't in the "core" spec?

[17:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
none of the elements are in the "core" spec (although a few attributes are)

[17:20:00.0000] <cardona507>
gotcha

[17:20:01.0000] <cardona507>
alot of specs

[17:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
also, while I don't personally care much how many different documents there area, the resulting broken cross-references make some things hard to follow

[17:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
the attributes in the "core" spec are there because shelley didn't want "hidden" in the vocabulary spec, and it seemed the others were thematically related so i figured i should move them all together

[17:36:00.0000] <cardona507>
How about this for <meter> http://img262.imageshack.us/img262/434/whatwgmeterex201.png ?

[17:37:00.0000] <cardona507>
hehe - expect the C would say 50 at the bottom :)

[17:38:00.0000] <cardona507>
like this http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/434/whatwgmeterex201.png

[17:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
interesting, though i'm not sure a browser would ever be that specific, since it doesn't really know it's a temperature gauge from the markup...

[17:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe that would be better as an xbl2 example

[17:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
(as a <meter> binding)

[17:45:00.0000] <cardona507>
what examples can you image a browser implementing?

[17:46:00.0000] <cardona507>
for example the one from the spec that talks about a tooltip appearing that says "23 seconds" - should I create that as a digital clock face?

[17:46:01.0000] <cardona507>
and have a mouse pointer and tooltip of course

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think gauges are more likely to be generic things like simple bars

[17:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
mac os x has some built-in indicators that might give some inspiration

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
gotta go cook dinner, bbiab

[18:17:00.0000] <cardona507>
web applications 1.0 - wow

[18:21:00.0000] <cardona507>
the kitchen sink - heh

[18:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if it's possible to have a kitchen sink, or if instead it would float

[18:43:00.0000] <cardona507>
thats a question for #css :)

[22:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, these new spec splits seem crazy. WTF?

[22:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
can't we come up with a way to keep everything in the same spec, but perhaps more cleanly divided into Core and Vocabulary sections, and have that distinction clearly reflected in the ordering of sections and splitting of the multi-page doc.

[22:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, "the attributes in the "core" spec are there because shelley didn't want "hidden" in the vocabulary spec..." - that's the most illogical and irrational justification ever.

[22:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
So just because Shelley wants something, you do it now? WTF?!

[23:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
at least it looks like the <details> removal didn't last for long

[23:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me ponders if gauge could be used by simply aliasing all the common misspellings to be the same element

[23:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[23:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
not an impossible idea

[23:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't work for xml though

[23:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
or createElement()

[23:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
XML assumes competent authors in the first place, surely competent enough to use spell checking. createElement is problematic, though :)

[23:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
dude i can't spell gauge to save my life

[23:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i typo it 9 times out of 10

[23:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
no, let's not repeat the same mistake with <image>

[23:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's not like i don't know how to spell it

[23:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
i just always get it wrong

[23:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
and if "<script langauje=''>" is anything to go by, i am by far not the exception

[23:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's an invisible and harmless typo, though

[23:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
the problem isn't people not catching it

[23:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
the problem is people wasting time making the mistake in the first place

[23:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I find it weird that people find gauge hard to spell

[23:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
i find it easy to spell, hard to type

[23:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
probably because I think of it by pronouncing it in Finnish in my mind, which makes the spelling unambiguous

[23:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh

[00:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Features defined in a very large  

[00:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>
spec, like SVG 1.2 Tiny

[00:01:02.0000] <Dashiva>
If Tiny is "very large", what is the full SVG spec? :)

[00:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
tiny is almost as large as html5

[00:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
should Tiny be split?!? ;-)

[00:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
imho no, though "full" should be dropped :-)

[00:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think aspects of Tiny (xml:id, XML Events, textArea) should be dropped, too

[00:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
can anyone figure out a succint way of presenting http://www.whatwg.org/specs/diagram.html ?

[01:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How about just listing each one (not WA 1.0), and then having a note "There's also a combined view of all the active specs <WA 1.0>"

[01:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
that doesn't really handle the HTML part (click the button), nor the Web SQL bit (at the bottom)

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me ponders taking out the Web Apps 1.0 column in lachy's table, and replacing it with a single link below

[01:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know that we want to encourage that view

[01:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: any opinion?

[01:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, why not?

[01:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
that version of the spec is the best

[01:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
also, I think presenting that diagram as a simple tree structure is easiest:

Or maybe you could do it as a venn-diagram or something

[01:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
venn diagram would be a bitch to maintain

[01:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
as i'm sure we'll be seeing more splits in the near future

[01:14:03.0000] <Lachy>
NOOOOOOO!!!!

[01:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
Seriously, no more spec splits. Please.

[01:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
splitting specs makes it difficult to figure out where to look to find something specific.

[01:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not planning any in particular, it just seems likely to happen given that we've had one issue resolved and it's resulted in a split

[01:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. Today, when looking through the proposed core and vocab splits, it took me a while to figure out where the Parsing section would be, since I intuitively thought it would be in Core

[01:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
I thought Vocab would be basically section 4, plus other elements and attributes scattered throughout a few other sections

[01:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, what's your reason for not wanting to encourage the Web Apps 1.0 spec?

[01:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno, hadn't really thought about it

[01:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
i figured it was just something i liked and maybe 2 or 3 other people and everyone else hated it

[01:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
certainly it's unpopular in w3c circles

[01:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
within W3C circles, just about everything in HTML5 is unpopular with some groups of people.

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
man i hate wiki syntax

[01:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
initially I hated the complete version, cause the annotation script really killed my browser. But since blocking that script, it works just fine and I use it all the time

[01:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
I think it might possible to use regular HTML syntax for tables in mediawiki

[01:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
so feel free to change it if you like

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's more that it is presentational

[01:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
(the markup, not the table)

[01:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
my problem with wiki markup is that it uses an odd mix of HTML and custom non-intuitive syntax

[01:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It is

[01:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But it would be even worse if every single part of HTML was reinvented in wiki markup, IMO

[01:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i just don't understand the need for a new language in the first place

[01:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
probably because people find editing HTML to be quite verbose, and the limited editing facilities provided by a textarea in a web page aren't really ideal

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: what do you think of http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_various_versions_of_the_spec.3F now?

[01:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
i tried to make it tidier

[01:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you explained Web Applications 1.0 outside the table, you could instead make the WA column "Location in WA 1.0", and the WHATWG specs column would be less wide and bulky

[01:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
i made the column narrower

[01:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure how to really explain the wa1 spec without scaring people :-)

[01:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
By the way, mediawiki tables look much nicer with border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 (at least I think so) :)

[01:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
have mediawiki devs not heard of css? :-)

[01:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the diff between current-work/ and complete.html?

[01:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me always read current-work/

[01:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You can use CSS too

[01:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
complete.html includes all the webapps specs

[01:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: i mean, why don't they jsut have some classes that make these tables actually pretty

[01:47:03.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[01:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor might know

[01:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
maybe mediawiki is supposed to support old IE

[01:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"All active work at WHATWG is gathered in the Web Applications 1.0 document, available in <links>. For the HTML-specific work only, see WHATWG HTML at <links>. Individual specifications are also available, see the following table."

[01:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to edit the table, i closed the tab :-)

[01:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I think the WHATWG needs a page with links to all the specs that are part of the canonical platform

[01:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
including a table-based visualization on overlapped specs

[01:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whether the overlap is WHATWG vs. W3C or IETF

[01:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
or CSS 2.1 vs. CSS3

[02:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
write one and put it on the blog :-)

[02:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I'd get accused of Webmandering again

[02:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
people accuse people of that?

[02:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://schepers.cc/?p=117

[02:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. jd has showed up in the blog comments

[02:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I intend the post a descriptive view of the platform some time based on the collectively edited W3C spec browser impl score card

[02:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Amusing the 'multi-page' link for Microdata links to the single page microdata.html, whereas 'single-page' links to all of WHATWG HTML :)

[02:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_various_versions_of_the_spec.3F

[02:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
it's very confusing to have this many spec vieews

[02:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it would be clearer to have tiny bits and complete

[02:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh, i hadn't seen http://hsivonen.iki.fi/web-stack/ before

[02:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but the intermediate collections seem confusing

[02:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
here's mine: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/images/abstract.png

[02:37:04.0000] <Dashiva>
There's only one, isn't there?

[02:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: I've lost track how many intermediate collections there are

[02:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
WHATWG HTML is "the" spec, WA 1.0 is more like a rendered view of complete

[02:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: i think i preferred it with the WHATWG HTML line in the table

[02:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
when you look at the answer you just naturally assume the table is complete

[02:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the material of the sink makes it look like a bathroom sink rather than a kitchen sink

[02:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
whereas now it's omitting the two main links

[02:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yeah, well, it was the best i could find on short notice :-P

[02:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: I was thinking like hsivonen, that it would be better to have a clear separation between individual specs and compilations

[02:40:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But by all means, it's a wiki :)

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
the idea of that section is really to answer the question "what should i be reading"

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: i like the split into two questions though

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway i really should go to bed

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: btw original picture was http://www.flickr.com/photos/wonderlane/2986252088/

[02:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, I finally got my internet connection back. That was annoying. ISP troubles, I guess.

[02:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, the spec table in the FAQ looks good now.

[02:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
the most recent changes were mostly Dashiva's work :-)

[02:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
i might add the WHATWG HTML line back in tomorrow, we'll se

[02:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
e

[03:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, why did you decide to take out the _in Single-page_ links here? http://wiki.whatwg.org/index.php?title=FAQ&diff=next&oldid=4340 They seemed useful

[03:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://twitter.com/adactio/status/7527318716

[03:05:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: I figured that if someone wants to see a specific specification, they wouldn't want to load all the other stuff in WHATWG HTML

[03:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(Also, I couldn't find a good way to include them both without either too much text or vague link names)

[03:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[03:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i like how in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/0192.html shelley refers to a message about "postmessage and localstorage" that i supposedly sent, and goes on to criticise me for mentioning localstorage... when the message in question, which she quotes in the very same e-mail, doesn't mention localstorage

[03:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i only references onhashchange and postmessage, both in html5)

[03:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
referenced, even

[03:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
haha

[03:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, shouldn't this bug now be resolved WONTFIX and Rejected, or at least reopened as it's no longer resolved as stated? http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8118

[03:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
reopened it

[03:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[03:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
so Julian thinks discussion changes in the WG's bug tracker is not an appropriate place to discuss spec changes? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/0340.html

[03:25:00.0000] <alfa>
Does all the ridiculousness in the W3C HTML WG have the potential to delay browser implementations of new features?

[03:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
alfa: To a certain degree, by consuming time and effort that could go to developing a better spec

[03:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: ...and writing code

[03:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone should make a concise summary of all the complaints people make, so when two people make conflicting complaints (e.g. the spec is too monolithic, the spec is too fragmented; discussion should be in bugs, discussion should be on the list; etc) we can point them at each other to resolve their differences themselves

[03:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
without dragging in any more people to the discussion than is necessary

[04:16:00.0000] <alfa>
davisha: ok, i was concerned that the current situation might cause FUD to make implementors consciously "wait and see"

[04:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
alfa: it could. too early to tell

[04:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
For some reason, my nick seems to be up there with gauge on spellability

[04:29:00.0000] <alfa>
dashiva:  my apologies :)

[07:17:00.0000] <mikekelly>
hi fans

[07:18:00.0000] <mikekelly>
what's the barrier to standardizing a javascript API for setting/flushing Authorization header (per domain) ?

[07:19:00.0000] <mikekelly>
obviously this is outside of HTML or HTTP - this is more just a general question aimed at browser people =)

[07:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why should it be a JS API?

[07:19:02.0000] <mikekelly>
why is XHR js?

[07:19:03.0000] <mikekelly>
:/

[07:19:04.0000] <Philip`>
Because the purpose of XHR is to let JS make HTTP requests, so it has to be JS

[07:20:00.0000] <mikekelly>
well this is to let JS set the Authorization header..

[07:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Authorization seems to be a purely HTTP thing

[07:20:02.0000] <mikekelly>
what?

[07:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
(currently)

[07:20:04.0000] <mikekelly>
what does that even mean

[07:20:05.0000] <mikekelly>
:/

[07:21:00.0000] <mikekelly>
so you can't understand what one might want to set Authorization header for a browser session?

[07:21:01.0000] <mikekelly>
with js

[07:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
I just mean there isn't currently a JS interface to any part of it, as far as I'm aware

[07:21:03.0000] <mikekelly>
right - I'm asking what the barrier is to that kind of API

[07:21:04.0000] <mikekelly>
where access is simply set/flush the header

[07:22:00.0000] <mikekelly>
and browser persists this per domain the same way it does for HTTP Basic right now..

[07:22:01.0000] <mikekelly>
but also exposes flush so we can actually implement logout..

[07:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
Probably the main problem is to convince people that a JS interface is better than any other ways of making authorization more useful (e.g. allowing custom HTML login forms, adding something to HTTP for logout pages, etc)

[07:22:03.0000] <mikekelly>
that's not how HTTP Authorization works

[07:23:00.0000] <mikekelly>
Logging In is a client-side state change

[07:23:01.0000] <mikekelly>
it's outside the scope of HTTP

[07:23:02.0000] <mikekelly>
whether the client is required to resubmit the Auth credentials for every request.. or they are persisted.. is down to the client

[07:23:03.0000] <mikekelly>
HTTP is completely agnostic to that

[07:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me sees a site that does <div class="FloatLeft VerdanaText Bold Font-Size-12 Margin-Top-4 Margin-Left-5 AlignCenter"  style="width: 190px; height: 15px;" >

[07:24:01.0000] <mikekelly>
if browser provided a JS API for set/flush the header per domain this functionality could be controlled via HTML+js 

[07:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray for separation of presentation and content

[07:25:00.0000] <mikekelly>
?

[07:25:01.0000] <mikekelly>
=/

[07:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
mikekelly: Maybe it'd be something that's useful - I guess you should write a proposal and see if anyone's interested

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
(That was an aside, not part of this discussion)

[07:26:01.0000] <mikekelly>
my proposal would be so badly written we'd waste all our time arguing about how bad it was

[07:26:02.0000] <mikekelly>
I'm more interested in why, from this end's perspective - that would be a bad idea

[07:27:00.0000] <mikekelly>
i.e. what are the obstacles to getting a standardized API agreed upon and implemented

[07:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
The obstacles are that somebody needs to propose the API and implementors need to be interested in it

[07:27:02.0000] <mikekelly>
how formal does that proposal need to be?

[07:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
like in http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#Is_there_a_process_for_adding_new_features_to_a_specification.3F

[07:28:00.0000] <mikekelly>
isn't this outside of HTML?

[07:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
There aren't any formal requirements, it should just try to clearly describe the problem that you're trying to solve, and your suggested way of solving it, in a way that other people can understand and agree with

[07:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
The same process should probably apply to any proposals for web browser features

[07:29:02.0000] <mikekelly>
ok then consider the last 10 minutes of this discussion my proposal

[07:29:03.0000] <mikekelly>
-_-

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
That won't work because nobody will read it

[07:31:00.0000] <mikekelly>
ok so who are the people worth tlaking to direct about this

[07:31:01.0000] <mikekelly>
they must be in here..

[07:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Email works better for this kind of thing

[07:32:01.0000] <mikekelly>
which list?

[07:33:00.0000] <mikekelly>
I'd still like to chat on here anyway it's a lot easier than back/forthing emails

[07:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me remembers some previous HTTP authentication discussion on the WHATWG list but doesn't remember what happened to it or if there's a better place now

[07:34:01.0000] <mikekelly>
Hixie: can you think of any reason to object to such a javascript API ?

[07:34:02.0000] <mikekelly>
yeah the problem with that one was

[07:34:03.0000] <mikekelly>
they were tyring to standardise some HTML way of doing that

[07:34:04.0000] <mikekelly>
which I think is pointless

[07:34:05.0000] <mikekelly>
just need a standard JS API

[07:34:06.0000] <mikekelly>
and let apps handle it as code on demand

[07:35:00.0000] <mikekelly>
you need.. Auth.set, Auth.flush, and Auth.isSet

[07:35:01.0000] <mikekelly>
that's about it

[07:36:00.0000] <mikekelly>
in some ways it would be good to have this method of controlling all headers

[07:36:01.0000] <mikekelly>
:)

[07:37:00.0000] <mikekelly>
but Auth's a specific case where you probably don't want to provide accessor

[07:37:01.0000] <mikekelly>
for obvious reasons :)

[07:38:00.0000] <mikekelly>
Philip`: if I posted this to WHATWG and went on to say I thought this was separate from HTML

[07:39:00.0000] <mikekelly>
I'm going to get told it's not up for discussion

[07:42:00.0000] <mikekelly>
so.. can I post that kind of thing to WHATWG list? Is there somewhere else? Is it like this on purpose so you guys don't have to bother yourselves with the real world?! ;)

[07:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think the WHATWG is being unreasonable by not being the place to solve all the world's problems at once

[07:44:00.0000] <mikekelly>
thank god we're getting video tags sorted

[07:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
What's wrong with posting it to a w3c list?

[07:44:02.0000] <mikekelly>
what's wrong with just discussing it on here first so you can explain why I'm so clearly wrong and we can all avoid wasting any more time?

[07:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Because people here either don't know much about the topic and/or don't care about it and/or don't want to talk you and/or are away

[07:45:01.0000] <mikekelly>
clearly they do care about it there was enough ping/pong last time it came up

[07:46:00.0000] <mikekelly>
or do we need some time to think up some super-clever reasons why this "just isn't going to happen"

[07:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Whatwg exists to pick up the balls w3c drops. It's best to check if w3c is actually going to drop it first. :)

[07:47:01.0000] <mikekelly>
well.. the line I was given before was

[07:47:02.0000] <mikekelly>
it matters not a feck what the standards say if we don't give a toss about it

[07:48:00.0000] <mikekelly>
so.. to avoid *wasting my time* I'll just skip the beuracracy and ask you direct

[07:48:01.0000] <mikekelly>
1. Why won't it work and/or 2. Why don't you care

[07:52:00.0000] <mikekelly>
"it doesn't matter" doesn't make much sense given the previous discussions around the same issue

[07:52:01.0000] <mikekelly>
so.. why won't it work ?

[07:58:00.0000] <webben>
/me suspects more relevant questions might be 1. Why should people care (what problem are you trying to solve)? 2. How might it work (what different solutions are there)?

[08:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And how it interacts with the other open suggestions relating to auth headers

[08:05:00.0000] <mikekelly>
webben: 1. A sensible way to use the Authorization header beyond HTTP Basic and the hideous login prompt

[08:05:01.0000] <mikekelly>
2. A standard JS API for setting/flushing the header

[08:06:00.0000] <mikekelly>
as long as there's an API.. it can be used

[08:06:01.0000] <mikekelly>
just like XHR

[08:10:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: That doesn't explain the problem you're trying to solve in end-user terms.

[08:13:00.0000] <mikekelly>
what?

[08:13:01.0000] <mikekelly>
if you literally mean end users using applications

[08:14:00.0000] <mikekelly>
then the difference between logging in through a form which POSTs to some endpoints and initiates a cookie'd session vs. a javascript rigged form that sets the Authorization header..

[08:14:01.0000] <mikekelly>
is nothing.

[08:14:02.0000] <mikekelly>
but the difference in terms of the underlying system is vast

[08:15:00.0000] <mikekelly>
since one is session based (using cookies) and the other is stateless (how HTTP is intended)

[08:16:00.0000] <mikekelly>
I shouldn't have to give you a lesson in why or how those are hugely different

[08:17:00.0000] <mikekelly>
but - yes - the 'user experience' is 'already solved'

[08:18:00.0000] <mikekelly>
webben: so.. where do we go from here?

[08:18:01.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: I think that makes for a harder sell, since there are a lot of features that need specifying/implementing that make a big difference to the user experience.

[08:18:02.0000] <mikekelly>
are you from the browser club?

[08:19:00.0000] <webben>
No. I'm a web developer.

[08:19:01.0000] <mikekelly>
hmm

[08:19:02.0000] <mikekelly>
really? fair enough.

[08:20:00.0000] <mikekelly>
the sell is supporting web architecture and recognizing an obvious problem and a simple solution..

[08:20:01.0000] <mikekelly>
:)

[08:21:00.0000] <mikekelly>
one could easily argue that video tags, SVG, etc. are all user experiences which are achievable via flash objects

[08:22:00.0000] <webben>
I think they offer a better user experience.

[08:22:01.0000] <mikekelly>
and why is that?

[08:22:02.0000] <daedb>
Because Flash is crap.

[08:23:00.0000] <webben>
Flash is crashy, has poor platform support, has poor accessibility support, has poor restylability support, and introduces additional security risks.

[08:23:01.0000] <mikekelly>
poor platform support?

[08:23:02.0000] <webben>
Yes.

[08:23:03.0000] <mikekelly>
I'm sure HTML5 will have humougous support

[08:23:04.0000] <mikekelly>
and no browser compat problems at all

[08:24:00.0000] <mikekelly>
I'm not being serious btw I'm just giving you an example of how pointless that 'user experience' line of argument is

[08:24:01.0000] <mikekelly>
it's not a realistic way of looking at 'users'

[08:24:02.0000] <webben>
HTML5 (as a description of the intersection of implementations) already has wider platform support.

[08:24:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Flash is closed, so it can by definition not be part of the open web platform...

[08:24:04.0000] <mikekelly>
open web is not user experience

[08:24:05.0000] <mikekelly>
nobody cares.

[08:24:06.0000] <mikekelly>
don't kid yourself

[08:24:07.0000] <daedb>
Flash is Adobe's way of trying to skullfuck the web.

[08:25:00.0000] <webben>
Flash's development is controlled by Adobe; it's a bit vague to say it's "closed".

[08:25:01.0000] <mikekelly>
so are websockets

[08:25:02.0000] <mikekelly>
but there you go

[08:25:03.0000] <webben>
(the specs are open to implementors now)

[08:25:04.0000] <mikekelly>
"hey I suck at HTTP - I know! WebSockets!"

[08:25:05.0000] <mikekelly>
you really should not have used 'web' in websockets

[08:26:00.0000] <mikekelly>
that really is a bit of a stretch.

[08:26:01.0000] <webben>
I don't think your example of pointlessness is a valid one.

[08:26:02.0000] <mikekelly>
sure it is

[08:26:03.0000] <mikekelly>
flash works fine in all major browsers

[08:26:04.0000] <mikekelly>
nobody has a problem with it

[08:26:05.0000] <mikekelly>
apart from people on Mac but then..

[08:26:06.0000] <daedb>
Although it's too bad that I don't know Flash... then I could apply for a job that sends me to Florida for 3 months :p

[08:27:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: The first claim is true, but does not contradict my claims. The second claim is untrue. Lots of people have lots of problems with Flash.

[08:27:01.0000] <mikekelly>
meh - it works

[08:27:02.0000] <webben>
(Given the web's usage, a small proportion of users is still a lot of people.)

[08:28:00.0000] <mikekelly>
ok well I wasn't being completely serious just proving a point re: 'user experience'

[08:28:01.0000] <webben>
You didn't persuade me, I'm afraid.

[08:29:00.0000] <mikekelly>
mmhmm

[08:29:01.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Have you considered trying to implement your idea in one of the various open source libraries?

[08:30:00.0000] <mikekelly>
I've considered how easy the implementation would/should be

[08:31:00.0000] <webben>
That's not really the same thing.

[08:31:01.0000] <webben>
http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/11/02/why-do-we-have-an-img-element

[08:31:02.0000] <mikekelly>
Fascinating.

[08:32:00.0000] <mikekelly>
ok so the point I've got to here is

[08:33:00.0000] <mikekelly>
"that would probably work but unfortunately the 'user experience' would not change and therefore it has no value"

[08:33:01.0000] <webben>
I don't understand how you conclude that from our discussion.

[08:33:02.0000] <mikekelly>
I'm not coding a PoC for something that simple

[08:33:03.0000] <mikekelly>
complete waste of time

[08:34:00.0000] <webben>
I didn't offer any ideas on whether it would work; I said that if it wouldn't have an end-user impact it would be a harder sell.

[08:34:01.0000] <mikekelly>
the end user impact is that they will be using stateless HTTP Authorization

[08:34:02.0000] <webben>
that's a technical detail, not an end-user impact

[08:34:03.0000] <mikekelly>
so is the openness of flash.

[08:35:00.0000] <webben>
I didn't raise the "openness of flash".

[08:35:01.0000] <mikekelly>
and object vs. video tags

[08:35:02.0000] <mikekelly>
and anything else in HTML

[08:35:03.0000] <webben>
Lots of things in HTML have end-user impact.

[08:35:04.0000] <mikekelly>
lots of things being added to html5?

[08:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Video, whether you agree with it or not, was a fairly easy sell

[08:36:01.0000] <webben>
I've already explained some of the reasons I think 'video' has end-user impact.

[08:37:00.0000] <mikekelly>
ok well you're failing to accept tthat developers and service/content providers are also users of html..

[08:37:01.0000] <mikekelly>
they care about stateless Auth

[08:37:02.0000] <mikekelly>
well.. the smart ones who know what they're talking about do

[08:37:03.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: No I'm differentiating between typical users and developers; and saying that features that affect the former are an easier sell.

[08:38:00.0000] <mikekelly>
why? so the browser vendors get more chicks?

[08:38:01.0000] <mikekelly>
can you please explain why that is the case..?!

[08:38:02.0000] <webben>
Because features that affect the primary user are more likely to increase software's share of the market.

[08:39:00.0000] <mikekelly>
'primary user'?

[08:39:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"Users are more important than authors"

[08:39:02.0000] <mikekelly>
yes I'm asking you WHY you make that distinction

[08:39:03.0000] <mikekelly>
and how you justify that

[08:39:04.0000] <webben>
It seems self-evident to me.

[08:39:05.0000] <mikekelly>
oh ok then

[08:39:06.0000] <othermaciej>
hi all

[08:39:07.0000] <mikekelly>
I thought the web arch guys were supposed to be religious.. :)

[08:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The web exists for the users

[08:40:01.0000] <mikekelly>
bullshit

[08:40:02.0000] <webben>
Am I supposed to be a "web arch guy"?

[08:40:03.0000] <mikekelly>
it's client/server 

[08:40:04.0000] <mikekelly>
webben: clearly not.

[08:40:05.0000] <Dashiva>
webben: No, mikekelly is

[08:40:06.0000] <webben>
Oh I see.

[08:41:00.0000] <mikekelly>
16:46 < Dashiva> The web exists for the users < please explain this sentiment

[08:41:01.0000] <mikekelly>
the web is client/server

[08:41:02.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Do you disagree that most users of popular browsers are not coders who would use your feature directly?

[08:42:00.0000] <mikekelly>
they aren't coders but they would use my feature directly

[08:42:01.0000] <mikekelly>
not conciously but they would use it..

[08:42:02.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: And that developer choice of what APIs to use are primarily determined by popular browser choices?

[08:42:03.0000] <mikekelly>
well that's given..

[08:42:04.0000] <mikekelly>
the sky is blue btw

[08:43:00.0000] <mikekelly>
where are you going with this..?

[08:44:00.0000] <mikekelly>
when people get HTML.. and run javascript + ajax.. they are using XHR

[08:44:01.0000] <webben>
So do you disagree that popular browsers stand to gain more marketshare by improving the user experience of those typical users than by putting the same energy into providing APIs not implemented by other browsers, that developers will adopt on the basis of market share?

[08:45:00.0000] <mikekelly>
obsolutely not because it's an utterly imperfect market

[08:45:01.0000] <mikekelly>
which you know very well

[08:45:02.0000] <mikekelly>
or at least you should

[08:45:03.0000] <webben>
I suspect most markets are imperfect one way or another.

[08:45:04.0000] <mikekelly>
so you all just sit on your arses trying to dream up 'sexy' fluff

[08:46:00.0000] <mikekelly>
while we have to do real work and deal with the bullshit you wont address

[08:46:01.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Do you contend that neither action has an effect on marketshare, then?

[08:46:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It doesn't seem like your proposal adds much except being sexy for fans of HTTP...

[08:46:03.0000] <mikekelly>
Dashiva: yeah.. fans of HTTP happen to be a MASSIVE economic force

[08:47:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: What action do you think popular browsers can take to increase their marketshare?

[08:47:01.0000] <mikekelly>
a huge consumer of resources..

[08:47:02.0000] <Dashiva>
No, they happen to be a very small group of people

[08:47:03.0000] <mikekelly>
erm..

[08:47:04.0000] <mikekelly>
no,

[08:47:05.0000] <Dashiva>
_Users_ of HTTP are a different story

[08:47:06.0000] <mikekelly>
what?!

[08:47:07.0000] <mikekelly>
are you fking insane?

[08:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What percentage of people do you think even know what HTTP is?

[08:48:01.0000] <mikekelly>
'fans' of HTTP happen to be anyone *DOING BUSINESS ON THE WEB*

[08:48:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Hardly

[08:48:03.0000] <mikekelly>
erm

[08:48:04.0000] <mikekelly>
ah man

[08:48:05.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: I like cats. That doesn't make me a fan of the precise evolution of cats' digestive systems.

[08:48:06.0000] <Dashiva>
HTTP is a tool. If it does the job, that's all they care about.

[08:48:07.0000] <mikekelly>
no

[08:49:00.0000] <mikekelly>
HTTP and tooling around that has direct effect on their capital expense

[08:49:01.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: The user experience does not make users a fan of the mechanics of how that experience is delivered.

[08:49:02.0000] <webben>
(not automatically, anyhow)

[08:49:03.0000] <mikekelly>
scalable, evolveable systems SAVE on capital expense

[08:49:04.0000] <mikekelly>
so this isn't just 'fanbois'

[08:49:05.0000] <mikekelly>
this is business people

[08:49:06.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a _tool_

[08:49:07.0000] <mikekelly>
fucking hell

[08:49:08.0000] <mikekelly>
it's a PROTOCOL

[08:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
SPDY is a good hint. If the tool doesn't fit well, you look for a better one.

[08:50:01.0000] <webben>
Punctuating your discussion with expletives and uppercase does not make your arguments more effective.

[08:51:00.0000] <mikekelly>
ok so - stateless auth means that the system is more efficient

[08:51:01.0000] <mikekelly>
so it's faster

[08:51:02.0000] <mikekelly>
so users experience a faster website

[08:51:03.0000] <mikekelly>
there you go.

[08:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You replace one header with another

[08:52:01.0000] <mikekelly>
is that a joke?

[08:52:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Sessions are already possible both with and without http auth

[08:52:03.0000] <webben>
right so finally we're back to talking about the end-user experience.

[08:53:00.0000] <mikekelly>
sessions shouldn't have to exist full stop

[08:53:01.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: So the goal is to increase the speed of the user experience?

[08:53:02.0000] <mikekelly>
using HTTP Auth eliminates the need for sessions

[08:53:03.0000] <mikekelly>
that is my point

[08:53:04.0000] <mikekelly>
avoiding sessions results in far more scalable systems

[08:53:05.0000] <mikekelly>
that are more efficient

[08:54:00.0000] <mikekelly>
so they run faster and consume less resources

[08:54:01.0000] <mikekelly>
which is good for everyone.

[08:54:02.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Which would increase the speed of user experience more? This or SPDY?

[08:54:03.0000] <mikekelly>
that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.. SPDY is mostly optmization on top of HTTP

[08:55:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Heck, this or developers compressing their JS/using CDNs.

[08:55:01.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: It has everything to do with the end goal of increasing the speed of the user experience.

[08:55:02.0000] <mikekelly>
CDNs and Js compression have nothing to do with one another

[08:55:03.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: They share the goal of increasing the speed of the user experience.

[08:55:04.0000] <mikekelly>
terrific thanks for that

[08:55:05.0000] <webben>
(Well, that's one benefit.)

[08:56:00.0000] <mikekelly>
webben: statless HTTP requests have the goal of increasing the efficiency of systems and improving user experience

[08:57:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: So when asking: is this worth doing, you need to consider whether there are other solutions that do more, not just whether your solution would have any effect at all.

[08:57:01.0000] <mikekelly>
right.. :/

[08:58:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: In particular, it's worth noting that JS compression for example works with all popular user agents so it's more attractive to typical developers than a feature where you'd need to code an alternative for popular browsers that don't support it.

[08:59:00.0000] <mikekelly>
thanks for the heads up

[09:00:00.0000] <webben>
Sarcasm doesn't make your arguments more effective either.

[09:00:01.0000] <mikekelly>
That is why this conversation revolves around a standard API for setting/flushing the Auth header..

[09:01:00.0000] <mikekelly>
note: standardized

[09:01:01.0000] <mikekelly>
i.e. 'popular browsers support it'

[09:01:02.0000] <mikekelly>
like XHR..

[09:01:03.0000] <mikekelly>
so.. anyway..

[09:01:04.0000] <mikekelly>
Dashiva: using HTTP Auth eliminates the need for sessions - avoiding sessions results in far more scalable systems that are more efficient - so they run faster and consume less resources

[09:01:05.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: In some distant future. In the meantime, browsers can implement features that deliver (arguably) more significant user benefits right now.

[09:02:00.0000] <webben>
Implementing features that benefit users right now is likely to be more attractive.

[09:02:01.0000] <mikekelly>
and that statement discludes my suggestion because of some bullshit arbitrary definition of 'user'

[09:02:02.0000] <mikekelly>
and 'benefit'

[09:02:03.0000] <webben>
It does not seem arbitrary to me.

[09:02:04.0000] <mikekelly>
well it is - which is why you can't quantify them

[09:04:00.0000] <webben>
I don't understand how my ability to quantify them would say anything about the arbitrariness of the definition.

[09:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(A system large enough to need good scalability likely has requirements on user experience that dictate hardware investment. More efficient systems would just mean less hardware used, not better user experience.)

[09:06:00.0000] <mikekelly>
Dashiva: yes - I guess if they get more users they should just go down the money tree for a few hours

[09:06:01.0000] <mikekelly>
lets be a bit more realistic an assume there isn't a bottomless pit of money..

[09:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think most sites do not use HTTP Auth because they want to control the login UI themselves

[09:07:00.0000] <mikekelly>
NO

[09:07:01.0000] <mikekelly>
really?

[09:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think it has anything to do with scalability issues

[09:07:03.0000] <mikekelly>
well clearly not - moving away from statelessness (HTTP Auth) is not in the interest of scalability

[09:07:04.0000] <mikekelly>
that is my point

[09:07:05.0000] <othermaciej>
mikekelly: whoah there turbo

[09:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
let's try to hold back our all-caps sarcasm

[09:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
HTTP Auth isn't stateless

[09:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, depending on what you mean by stateless

[09:09:01.0000] <mikekelly>
you weren't here but the start of this convo was my proposal for a JS API that can set/flush the Auth header.. which would allow html+js UI to log in and out

[09:09:02.0000] <mikekelly>
othermaciej: no 'shared state'; i.e. no session

[09:09:03.0000] <othermaciej>
digest auth has both permanent state on the client (saved username / pw) and temporary state (the nonce)

[09:10:00.0000] <mikekelly>
and you can leverage that from html+js ?

[09:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
A JS API to set a username/password pair to use for a specific protection space on a particular server might be useful

[09:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think it would result in things being any less stateful

[09:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
your responses still have to vary based on the Authorization header

[09:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(instead of based on Cookie)

[09:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in fact with digest auth Authorization is different every time, so it's harder to build a reverse proxy that caches effectively

[09:12:01.0000] <mikekelly>
no, that's what layering is for

[09:12:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and basic auth sends the password in essentially plaintext every time, which is broken

[09:12:03.0000] <mikekelly>
whereas sessions are perfectly secure of course

[09:14:00.0000] <mikekelly>
Digest isn't different every time, regardless using tokens (whether they contain variable nonces etc) in the Auth header doesn't require shared state/token

[09:14:01.0000] <Dashiva>
There's already one or two proposals for combining form login with HTTP auth

[09:14:02.0000] <mikekelly>
Which is why I would say a simple API to set/flush

[09:15:00.0000] <webben>
Arguments of the form: "We can ignore problem X with Solution A, because Solution B is not totally immune to similar problems." aren't very strong.

[09:15:01.0000] <mikekelly>
othermaciej: a set/flush would provide a generic mechanism for any HTTP Auth mechanism

[09:16:00.0000] <mikekelly>
Digest,OAuth, WSSE, etc.

[09:16:01.0000] <mikekelly>
js picks up 401's - parses WWW-Authenticate header

[09:16:02.0000] <mikekelly>
does it's magic

[09:16:03.0000] <mikekelly>
sets the Authorization header

[09:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you really don't want to set the actual Auth header

[09:17:01.0000] <mikekelly>
why is that?

[09:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
because the client is not in a position to compute the digest for every resource

[09:17:03.0000] <mikekelly>
it wouldn't.. it would set it

[09:17:04.0000] <mikekelly>
and the API would persist it

[09:17:05.0000] <mikekelly>
the same way it does if you log in with Basic

[09:17:06.0000] <othermaciej>
when you load a page and its subresources over http digest auth, each resource needs a different Authorize header

[09:18:00.0000] <mikekelly>
no it doesn't..

[09:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"The Digest scheme challenges

[09:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
   using a nonce value. A valid response contains a checksum (by default, the MD5 checksum) of the username, the password, the given

[09:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
   nonce value, the HTTP method, and the requested URI."

[09:18:04.0000] <othermaciej>
from the RFC

[09:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's a challenge-response protocol

[09:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you can't set a valid response before seeing the chalenge

[09:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
many other strong auth methods (NTLM, Kerberos) also work on a challenge/response basis

[09:20:00.0000] <mikekelly>
right - but the client credentials don't change..

[09:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the username and password don't change

[09:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so you could let JS tell those to the browser

[09:21:01.0000] <mikekelly>
with the auth echeme

[09:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but the *header* that you send

[09:21:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that does change

[09:21:04.0000] <mikekelly>
a decent point

[09:21:05.0000] <mikekelly>
thank you

[09:21:06.0000] <mikekelly>
:)

[09:22:00.0000] <mikekelly>
so an api per supported Auth scheme?

[09:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
a single server can have multiple named protection spaces

[09:23:01.0000] <mikekelly>
where credentials are presisted and the header calculated

[09:23:02.0000] <mikekelly>
realms?

[09:23:03.0000] <othermaciej>
right, realms

[09:23:04.0000] <mikekelly>
yeah - that's ok right?

[09:23:05.0000] <othermaciej>
you'd need a username/password per {protocol,host,port,realm} tuple

[09:24:00.0000] <mikekelly>
realm is specified in the request

[09:24:01.0000] <webben>
/me vaguely wonders whether HTTP Auth could be directly supported in HTML with something likely digestUsername="#idref" and a digestPassword="#idref" on any element taking an "action" attribute.

[09:24:02.0000] <webben>
*like

[09:24:03.0000] <mikekelly>
it's much easier for everyone if it's just a JS API

[09:25:00.0000] <webben>
/me disagrees.

[09:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's much easier if we provide a way to map a regular non-JS form to an auth response

[09:25:02.0000] <othermaciej>
not sure

[09:25:03.0000] <othermaciej>
doing it declaratively is handy

[09:25:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but the JS API could also be useful

[09:25:05.0000] <mikekelly>
it is - but it's way less risk as an API

[09:26:00.0000] <webben>
Sure, I didn't mean having an HTML feature would mean a JS feature would be bad.

[09:26:01.0000] <mikekelly>
at least then you can see how it behaves 'in the wild' and make the judgement

[09:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that being said, I don't see how http auth is any less stateful, and as I said before, it seems harder to cache via  areverse proxy

[09:26:03.0000] <webben>
Not sure how it's less risk as an API.

[09:26:04.0000] <mikekelly>
Vary: Authorization

[09:26:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Vary: Authorization is no better than Vary: Cookie

[09:27:00.0000] <mikekelly>
it's not harder

[09:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in fact it's worse, because the Authorization header is different every single time with strong auth schemes

[09:27:02.0000] <mikekelly>
you generally can't cache a private resource anyway

[09:27:03.0000] <othermaciej>
whereas session cookies persist

[09:27:04.0000] <mikekelly>
depending on how you build your systems

[09:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
on a system like facebook nearly every resource is private

[09:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
also, both Authorization and Cookie are added promiscuously - the only way to exclude them from non-private resources is to put those on a separate subdomain

[09:29:00.0000] <mikekelly>
why is that a problem?

[09:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you can't put your main page on a separate subdomain

[09:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway

[09:30:02.0000] <mikekelly>
why would you want to?

[09:30:03.0000] <mikekelly>
the resposne determines cachability

[09:30:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think a version of your proposal is reasonable, but I don't think your justification for it (less stateful / more scalable) seems sound to me

[09:30:05.0000] <mikekelly>
the fact that request contained cookie or auth header is irrelevant

[09:31:00.0000] <mikekelly>
othermaciej: it's simple; there's no shared state by session

[09:31:01.0000] <mikekelly>
which means the server side doesn't need to maintain any session

[09:31:02.0000] <mikekelly>
which makes horizontal scalability lot more simple

[09:32:00.0000] <mikekelly>
the only thing you're worring about there is the nonce

[09:32:01.0000] <mikekelly>
which is a lot less of a challenge than a pool of sessions, for obvious reasons

[09:33:00.0000] <mikekelly>
no?

[09:36:00.0000] <webben>
Although for the next five years or so, you'd still need a pool of sessions for users of browsers that don't support the API, if you wanted to give them the same login UI?

[09:36:01.0000] <mikekelly>
how many new features fall into that category?

[09:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't understand why storing the nonce is less of a burden than storing a session cookie

[09:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I suppose you could time it out more aggressively

[09:38:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Many features require double provision; I think it's rare for that double-provision to prevent one realizing the benefits of single provision.

[09:38:01.0000] <webben>
that is to say, if you have to maintain nonces and sessions, has scalability gotten any simpler?

[09:39:00.0000] <webben>
Contrast SPDY. In theory, that runs from the same web servers on the same machines. If a client supports it, their user experience will be faster; if not, it won't.

[09:39:01.0000] <mikekelly>
...

[09:39:02.0000] <mikekelly>
:/

[09:39:03.0000] <webben>
The need to cater to clients that don't support does not negate its advantages.

[09:39:04.0000] <webben>
*don't support it

[09:39:05.0000] <webben>
Do you see what I mean?

[09:41:00.0000] <mikekelly>
if it's an API it would be possible to write work-arounds for legacy clients

[09:41:01.0000] <mikekelly>
of course

[09:41:02.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: I'm talking about the server.

[09:41:03.0000] <mikekelly>
sure - the web is an evolutionary thing

[09:42:00.0000] <mikekelly>
it doesn't improve by magic..

[09:42:01.0000] <mikekelly>
you're asking me what my objective is

[09:43:00.0000] <webben>
That doesn't undermine the distinction - for individuals developers - between adopting a feature that can improve X now, versus one that could only improve X in five years time and in the meantime makes X more complicated.

[09:44:00.0000] <mikekelly>
ok well we have big players in the web

[09:44:01.0000] <mikekelly>
I'm sure if they thought they could cut costs they'd be interested

[09:44:02.0000] <webben>
SPDY can improve performance now, even if it makes delivering performance more complicated. Seems to me you're saying this API would improve scalability in five years or so, while making scalability more complicated in the meantime.

[09:44:03.0000] <webben>
Which could in fact increase costs, as far as I can see.

[09:45:00.0000] <mikekelly>
it's really not that complicated if you're systems are built properly :)

[09:45:01.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: I didn't make any judgement about *how* much more complicated it is.

[09:45:02.0000] <webben>
Simply that is is more complicated.

[09:45:03.0000] <mikekelly>
ok well then you can't just make that judgement it has to be in some context

[09:45:04.0000] <webben>
benefits vs costs

[09:46:00.0000] <mikekelly>
ok it could be 4 days of work complicated

[09:46:01.0000] <webben>
immediate benefit: 0; immediate cost: >0 (due to it being more complicated)

[09:46:02.0000] <mikekelly>
and 20 million saved in beenefit

[09:46:03.0000] <webben>
how is this 20 million saved if you still need to maintain the session pool?

[09:47:00.0000] <mikekelly>
20 million as 15% of some massive scale

[09:47:01.0000] <webben>
How though?

[09:48:00.0000] <mikekelly>
with a really well designed, distributed system

[09:48:01.0000] <webben>
That doesn't really answer the question.

[09:48:02.0000] <mikekelly>
you want a web arch lesson?

[09:49:00.0000] <webben>
I'd like a concise explanation of how you'd increase scalability while maintaining a session pool.

[09:49:01.0000] <mikekelly>
Roy Fielding wrote his dissertation on a style of building systems that seems to work quite well. :)

[09:50:00.0000] <mikekelly>
I know I'm not realy allowed to say that

[09:50:01.0000] <webben>
How would you apply the ideas in that dissertation to solve this problem?

[09:51:00.0000] <mikekelly>
by leveraging the layered constraint as it applies to HTTP.

[09:51:01.0000] <webben>
Which means what?

[09:51:02.0000] <mikekelly>
have you read the paper?

[09:52:00.0000] <webben>
A while ago, yeah.

[09:52:01.0000] <mikekelly>
statelessness is a primary constraint of the style he outlines there

[09:53:00.0000] <webben>
Okay ... but your solution still has to involve "state" because it has to include a session pool.

[09:53:01.0000] <mikekelly>
mmmhmm..

[09:54:00.0000] <mikekelly>
if the components of whatever makes up your system are decoupled then it's a lot easier to "partition" in the way you seem to think is so impossible

[09:55:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Are you saying you'd basically have one lot of servers handle requests using your API and another lot handle requests using sessions?

[09:55:01.0000] <mikekelly>
regardless - features like this can have application and value, the fact that we may have to wait until it is appropriate for mass distribution is irrelevant, and sitting around worrying about that isn't going to make it happen

[09:56:00.0000] <webben>
It may be irrelevant to you. It's not irrelevant to developers of clients or servers considering implementing the feature.

[09:57:00.0000] <webben>
Especially, when they could implement something else to realize cost-savings, like SPDY.

[09:58:00.0000] <mikekelly>
why do you keep referring to SPDY as an alternative to this?

[09:59:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Because it also offers a faster user experience with (potentially) lower costs.

[10:00:00.0000] <mikekelly>
and that somehow eliminates the benefit here how?

[10:00:01.0000] <webben>
It doesn't elimate the putative benefit; it means the benefit/cost ratio of one action is higher than the other action.

[10:01:00.0000] <webben>
So rational actors are more likely to take the former action - because time/resource/money is limited.

[10:01:01.0000] <webben>
*eliminate

[10:02:00.0000] <mikekelly>
.. right ..

[10:02:01.0000] <mikekelly>
:)

[10:03:00.0000] <webben>
So I'd suggest developing a client/server pair that implements your ideas along the lines of SPDY would be a good way to gain traction for them.

[10:05:00.0000] <mikekelly>
a client/server pair that implements some form of HTTP Authorization?

[10:05:01.0000] <mikekelly>
I don't think I need to bother.

[10:06:00.0000] <mikekelly>
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/index.html?RESTAuthentication.html

[10:07:00.0000] <webben>
yeah, I meant a client implementing your JS API and a server system that supports session pools and nonces simultaneously.

[10:08:00.0000] <webben>
not just any old implementation of HTTP Authorization.

[10:08:01.0000] <mikekelly>
to prove what? that the programming languages work ok?

[10:09:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Well, if nothing else, you'd then be able to submit patches to the systems you'd modified in order to have actual implementations.

[10:09:01.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Though I suspect you might also refine the ideas through actual implementation.

[10:09:02.0000] <mikekelly>
that sounds like a terrific waste of time

[10:10:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: Is that because you'd have to learn a lot of new code to contribute the patch to an existing browser?

[10:12:00.0000] <webben>
/me is confused as to why it's a terrific waste of time for you, but a great use of others' time.

[10:13:00.0000] <mikekelly>
.. this conversation is turning into a terrific waste of time

[10:14:00.0000] <mikekelly>
it's a waste of time because 1. I'm not a browser dev and 2. what's the point if nobody agrees anyway

[10:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm a browser dev and we'd probably take a WebKit patch to implement something like this, if it also got discussion in the relevant standards

[10:21:00.0000] <mikekelly>
othermaciej: that was really my initial query - where abouts would you 'take' something like this

[10:24:00.0000] <mikekelly>
because if it's "just" a JS API like XHR it doesn't really belong in HTML spec

[10:24:01.0000] <mikekelly>
right?

[10:39:00.0000] <webben>
mikekelly: http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/ and WHATWG would seem appropriate forums.

[11:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
"an already almost one million pixels height spec"

[11:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's the first time I've seen it measured in those units

[11:14:00.0000] <daedb>
Well we could always increase the line-height, then it'll be even taller!

[14:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
Argh. Email is not twitter. tinyurl is totally unnecessary

[14:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, just do {| class="prettytable" and define .prettytable at [[MediaWiki:Common.css]], that's what Wikipedia does.  We don't add extra styles IIRC, {| just produces <table>.

[14:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
By which I mean "both irritating and harmful"

[14:59:00.0000] <webben>
jgraham: Hmm. Some URLs get broken and more than ~75 chars.

[14:59:01.0000] <webben>
*at more

[14:59:02.0000] <jgraham>
webben: Personally I find copy and paste to be less bad than playing "guess the destination"

[15:00:00.0000] <webben>
jgraham: aliases help.

[15:01:00.0000] <webben>
(you might be able to find a de-tinyifier for your email-consuming software fwiw)

[15:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If nothing else, the recent events are giving a glimpse at what people really think behind the masks...


2010-01-10
[16:01:00.0000] <Philip`>

[16:01:01.0000] <Philip`>

s/do/are/

[16:06:00.0000] <webben>
/me is left wondering whether using a bug tracker where everyone on the wg is subscribed by default, but where you could desubscribe from tickets you don't care about, might work better.

[16:07:00.0000] <webben>
It wouldn't solve the socio-political problems; but it would at least keep information (or ranting ;) ) about each given subject in a single place and allow people to detach themselves from discussions they're not interested in.

[16:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There is a lot of bug spam too, though

[16:08:01.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: I think a good system would allow admins to prevent people getting such spam.

[16:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, then they wouldn't be subscribed to all bugs

[16:09:01.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: What do you mean by "spam" in this case?

[16:09:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Nonsensical reports, help questions, obviously invalid bugs

[16:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The "good system" you describe is what we're supposed to have, with marking bugs as non-editoral making them go to public-html

[16:11:00.0000] <webben>
I think there's an advantage in a system that groups all discussion on a topic in one place.

[16:11:01.0000] <webben>
forking discussions of interesting bugs to a general mailing list doesn't do that.

[16:12:00.0000] <webben>
I can see there's a problem with "spam" as you describe. If that can be moderated without too much socio-political friction, then I guess the ideal system would subscribe everyone to non-"spam" bugs as decided by some human moderators.

[16:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes, that's what is supposed to happen

[16:13:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Only without making every WG member a bugzilla user

[16:13:02.0000] <webben>
I thought that bugzilla was supposed to be used to summarize relevant arguments from the list?

[16:14:00.0000] <webben>
That doesn't seem probable.

[16:14:01.0000] <webben>
(It's onerous and contentious.)

[16:16:00.0000] <webben>
What I'm suggesting is similar to the approach Hixie uses, as I understand, where he simply files away mail under a topic heading.

[16:16:01.0000] <Dashiva>
As I see it, public-html is discussion, bugzilla is for editor response, and issues are for overruling the editor

[16:16:02.0000] <webben>
until he's ready to deal with the topic.

[16:16:03.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: Yep, that's the process as I understand it. Not persuaded it's an ideal one though ;)

[16:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not ideal at all, but I doubt you can do better given the WG membership :)

[16:20:00.0000] <webben>
/me has never really bought into the mailing lists as effective discussion venues though. There's a lot of noise thanks to permathreads where people repeat old arguments - that might be less likely to happen if they had previous posts immediately above them.

[16:20:01.0000] <webben>
(Granted you see contentious issues in the Mozilla Bugzilla where people don't seem to read previous posts.)

[16:20:02.0000] <Dashiva>
You mean like how there's never any repeat discussion on wikipedia? :)

[16:21:00.0000] <webben>
/me has never followed a really contentious discussion on Wikipedia - I'm sure they exist though. ;)

[16:22:00.0000] <webben>
possibly some sort of rating/bolding/highlighting system might help crystalize the arguments people need to address.

[16:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm a little bit jaded.

[16:22:02.0000] <Dashiva>
The wiki was supposed to be a place to summarize arguments, and that didn't really go anywhere

[16:22:03.0000] <webben>
/me doesn't blame you for being jaded.

[16:23:00.0000] <webben>
I suspect the whole approach of trying to summarize arguments is unrealistic.

[16:23:01.0000] <webben>
(unless, maybe, you're going to have a straw poll on a subject)

[16:24:00.0000] <webben>
that's why I suggest a process where all discussion on a topic is just dumped in the same place, perhaps with a way to highlight bits someone thought was important.

[16:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like the IRC logs

[16:25:01.0000] <webben>
Philip`: Very much.

[16:25:02.0000] <webben>
Though organized by topic.

[16:25:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Only evil people use IRC

[17:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
This whole spec splitting debacle has just gone to show that there are clear flaws in the way the process was set up, yet instead of people complaining about the broken process, they're blaming Hixie for somehow not following it.

[17:52:00.0000] <cardona507>
what are some of the flaws in the process that you see?

[17:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
The process allows bugs for non-trivial issues to be filed in bugzilla, where they clearly don't get as much attention as a proper WG discussion, but the process allows the editor to review the arguments in the bug and make an initial assessment and make relevant changes

[17:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
for trvial bugs, that process is not a problem. Hixie does it all the time.

[17:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
But with a major issue, like requesting the removal of a section, there are two choices. Either Hixie rejects the idea, and someone can choose to escalate it (which ends up giving it the attention it deserved in the first place)

[17:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
Or Hixie can accept the proposal and make the change, but then suffer serious blow back from the rest of the WG as most were not involved in the bugzilla discussion, due to the difficulty of following those bugs compared with the mailing list.

[17:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
My e-mail on the issue basically said, major and potentiall controversial issues should at least have a first round of discussion on the mailing list, optionally opening a bug in parallel for tracking purposes, but where at least initial significant discussion takes place on the list

[17:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
that allows us to get a rough idea of how the group feels about the issue

[18:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
of course, public-html would be a lot healthier if it wasn't so buried in process discussions all the time, which is effecitly the cause of us having to set up bugzilla to keep real technical issues separate from the nonsense

[18:00:01.0000] <cardona507>
I guess an argument might be "but what if the bug didn't get opened in parallel? and then the conversation petered out but there was not bug to force action"

[18:00:02.0000] <cardona507>
*not a bug

[18:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
then someone can open a bug, and cite the major technical arguments for/against and include an initial change proposal. That allows the editor to review the bug and past discussion and make an initial decision

[18:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
and then follow the rest of the process as normal from that point onwards

[18:02:00.0000] <cardona507>
so you are basically saying that you would like it if people could just discuss such major issues before soley relying on bugzilla?

[18:02:01.0000] <webben>
Keeping all technical discussion under bugs might reduce the amount of process discussion, since it would basically be OT for a bug.

[18:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
webben, it doesn't help to reduce it on the list, and so real technical discussion which is harder for people to follow in bugzilla gets lost, while everyone still gets flooded with process discussions

[18:04:00.0000] <webben>
I think that bugzilla is making technical discussion hard to follow is a consequence of the tracker software and how it's being used, not an intrinsic problem with bug-oriented discussion

[18:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
this is they the WHATWG model was so much healthier for years before the W3C got involved. It's just gone downhill from there.

[18:04:02.0000] <webben>
I think the WHATWG model worked reasonably well for people involved throughout the process.

[18:05:00.0000] <webben>
It worked less well for newcomers and people intermittently involved the longer the process went on, since it became harder to follow why decisions had been taken/what relevant information had already been presented.

[18:05:01.0000] <webben>
The mailing list search was never very user-friendly.

[18:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, I'm in pain from my elbow injury  and I'm going to bed.  good night

[18:06:01.0000] <webben>
I don't from a pure process perspective the W3C-WHATWG partnership has improved the situation though.

[18:07:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: Good night! Hope that heals soon!

[18:07:01.0000] <cardona507>
night Lachy

Anyone know why geolocation isn't in the web applications 1.0 spec?

hm

[03:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
it strikes me that an appcache manifest served over https: can cause a page from another server served over https: to be cached, even if that page is marked no-store

[03:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i should add same-origin checks for manifests served over https:

/me just sent an e-mail as "Simetrical" instead of "Aryeh Gregor" for some reason . . . thanks, Gmail?

[04:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, it was from simetrical⊙gc and not simetrical+w3c⊙gc, so I'm not sure it will even get through.

[05:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: It'll send you a thing asking if you're willing to have your mails archived, if you haven't used that address before

[05:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
and if you say no then the message won't be sent

[05:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
but otherwise it should get through

[05:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Assuming you mean public-html, not the whatwg list)

[05:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, it was www-style, actually.

[05:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ah

[05:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
Same thing there, I think

[05:40:00.0000] <Utkarsh>
I had a question. If I need to group several <article> with a parent element, should I use <section>?

[05:54:00.0000] <webben>
Utkarsh: Depends.

[05:55:00.0000] <webben>
Utkarsh: What is the relationship between the articles?

[05:59:00.0000] <Utkarsh>
well, I'm laying out the frontpage of a blog. I saw one site enclosing all the <article> in a section. I had earlier used a div#container for this.

[06:29:00.0000] <webben>
Utkarsh: I think "div" remains most appropriate for that.

[06:29:01.0000] <webben>
Utkarsh: "A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element's contents would be listed explicitly in the document's outline."

[06:30:00.0000] <webben>
Utkarsh: the grouping of articles on the frontpage of the blog doesn't seem like it would normally get a distinct entry in the document's outline.

[06:31:00.0000] <webben>
Utkarsh: See also the example for the 'nav' element: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#the-nav-element

[06:32:00.0000] <_Utkarsh>
webben: ah, I think using a div would be more appropriate then, they've used that in the example too

karlcow: Wouldn't translation be more reliable with a single document? With multiple there might be differences in terminology because it's not immediately obvious the same term appears in multiple documents

[11:20:00.0000] <karlcow>
Dashiva: from experience, small documents get translated big ones no. When the document is too big, you end up doing a terminology because you are working in team. 

[11:21:00.0000] <karlcow>
most of the time, translators are volunteer people

[11:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But it's not like you couldn't translate one section at a time, or one section per person

[11:34:00.0000] <karlcow>
Dashiva: it's what we do. it still needs a terminology. it is a team work, requires coordination, etc. (fwiw: I have been translated a few w3c specs more than 8 years ago as a volunteer)

[14:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, whatwg.org isn't responding

[16:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
something's leaking in apache on my server

[16:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: fixed

[16:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Must be the cats

[16:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
cat apache

[16:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, thanks

[16:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just upgraded the wordpress installation

[16:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me makes a note to check for mediawiki upgrade later

[16:46:00.0000] <ttepasse>
Hm. Why isn't there a isProtocolHandlerRegistered() to registerProtocolHandler()?

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
because we don't want to expose whether the user deleted the registration or not

[16:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
just call register...() againt

[16:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
again, even

[16:49:00.0000] <ttepasse>
Ah.

[20:04:00.0000] <sirdarckcat>
hello, I have a question regarding the CSS3 spec

[20:04:01.0000] <sirdarckcat>
why the "Malformed statements"

[20:05:00.0000] <sirdarckcat>
from

[20:05:01.0000] <sirdarckcat>
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#parsing-errors

[20:05:02.0000] <sirdarckcat>
was removed on

[20:05:03.0000] <sirdarckcat>
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-syntax/#error-handling

[20:05:04.0000] <sirdarckcat>
how should a parser behave if it finds a selector that can't be parsed?

[20:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Drop it and the following block, I believe.

[20:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Easy to test.

[20:07:02.0000] <sirdarckcat>
hmm, yes, that's how browsers behave.. my meaning is

[20:07:03.0000] <sirdarckcat>
if there was a particular reason to remove it from the spec

[20:07:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dunno.

[20:08:00.0000] <aho>
halt and catch fire if it's IE :>

[20:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could ask www-style.

[20:08:02.0000] <sirdarckcat>
mailing list or channel?

[20:08:03.0000] <sirdarckcat>
oh

[20:08:04.0000] <sirdarckcat>
mailing list

[20:08:05.0000] <sirdarckcat>
haha

[20:08:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's a #css here, but I don't think the spec editors hang out there regularly.  I believe there's a W3C IRC network too.  But I meant the list.

[20:08:07.0000] <sirdarckcat>
yes hehe

[20:09:00.0000] <sirdarckcat>
oh well, I was just trying to see if there was some point I was missing

[20:09:01.0000] <sirdarckcat>
I'll ask them

[20:09:02.0000] <sirdarckcat>
thanks

[20:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I didn't even look at the spec, TBH.

[20:09:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just be sure it wasn't just moved someplace else or anything.

[20:10:00.0000] <sirdarckcat>
yeah, I'm trying to see the tokenization section, and the selector := any+ seems to imply that almost anything is acceptable

[20:10:01.0000] <sirdarckcat>
but stuff like

[20:10:02.0000] <sirdarckcat>
^= and $= selectors are not declared in that syntax

[20:11:00.0000] <sirdarckcat>
but its normal, since the document states that the SELECT chapter should be merged

[20:11:01.0000] <sirdarckcat>
anyway, I still find it difficult to find a specific about what to do

[20:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to work out what document.clear() is

[20:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
sirdarckcat: look at the dates of those documents - the CSS2 one is from sept 2009, the CSS3 one is from Aug 2003.

[20:13:01.0000] <aho>
back to the future :v

[21:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know what the term "activation object" in ES3 became in ES5?

[21:24:00.0000] <sirdarckcat>
@Hixie, oh you are right

[21:24:01.0000] <sirdarckcat>
thanks

[22:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
hole kittens, i actually got below 90 bugs finally

[22:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
i thought that was like some sort of unbreakable barrier there for a while

[02:46:00.0000] <payman>
gsnedders: ping

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: cvs locked again

[02:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
dammit

[02:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: working on it now

[02:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
at least I know now that that it's not my author-view automation that's causing the problem

[02:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: how long has it been hanging?

[02:57:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
systeam tells me the lock has an up-to-this-minute timestamp on it

[02:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
and that the PIDs are changing as we speak

[02:57:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
so something is running normally

[02:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: about 3 minutes

[02:57:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I mean it's not a stale lock at least

[02:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[02:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[02:58:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
please give it another few minutes

[02:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
actually 14 minutes so far

[02:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
but sure

[02:58:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[02:58:06.0000] <Hixie>
not like i have any choice :-P

[02:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
10:51 UTC is when i first got a lock message

[02:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
haven't checked anything into the /spec/ directory since

[02:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
i should say, i haven't succeeded at checking anything into there since

[02:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
(i have tried)

[03:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[03:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
for the record, this microdata split is dumb

[03:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
it makes the <link> and <meta> sections silly

[03:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
and makes all the global stuff - index, lists of attributes, etc - wrong also

[03:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
and the postmsg thing makes the Window object IDL silly

[03:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
sigh

[03:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
i hate these splits

[03:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: locks seem to be clearing and then coming back again very quickly

[03:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
something must be looping

[03:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
well it ain't me, i'm not checking anything in right now

[03:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: i just discovered that some of the examples in the spec are invalid HTML4, so I'm having to comment them out of the w3c version of the spec

[03:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I think the answer to that should be that they don't assert that they're valid HTML4

[03:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
these were examples where there was first the source, then the example literally in the spec so you could see what it looked like

[03:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
i just removed the second part and left the source

[03:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. search for "gross margin table"

[03:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
that <table> uses the HTML5-suggested "<tfoot>-comes-last" markup style

[03:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
so i left the markup but hid the actual table

[03:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah tfoot

[03:10:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I would rather we just got rid of tfoot

[03:10:03.0000] <Hixie>
there are other examples, like <p> in <caption>, and so on

[03:10:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
I see

[03:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
i expect the number will increase as i add examples

[03:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you could solve this problem most easily by just removing all the examples

[03:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[03:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me prefers invoking the wrath of the gods on whoever thinks that HTML5 shouldn't be writen in HTML5

[03:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes that he believes this to be a purely psychological terror

[03:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
every HTML4 draft was published using HTML4

[03:19:00.0000] <webben>
It's a good practice for languages that want backwards compatibility to demonstrate that in the spec! :)

[03:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, who has requested that the spec be written in HTML4?

[03:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
w3c pubteam

[03:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
wtf? Just tell them no.

[03:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
hahahahaha

[03:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
good luck with that

[03:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
please feel free to be my spokesperson the next time we publish

[03:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm done arguing with w3c over stupid things like that

[03:22:02.0000] <jgraham>
You could try "It is reducing the quaility of the spec" although I'm not convinced that argument holds much weight

[03:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
Just explain that due to the examples in the spec illustrating HTML5, the spec itself cannot be valid HTML4

[03:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
i've tried every argument under the sun already

[03:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's no longer my concern

[03:23:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me suggests splitting out the examples into their own spec.

[03:23:03.0000] <Lachy>
/me runs

[03:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: Don't someone will probably take you seriously

[03:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
the canonical version of the spec is on the whatwg.org site, the w3c can take as long as they like to get over their problems and get with the programme

[03:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me waves to MLW

[03:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is he still going?

[03:26:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I'll bet you a <details> Hixie's latest line will be on it

[03:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
It seems (s)he is. I'd forgoten all about it to be honest 

[03:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8628 - are we sure that the term "boolean attribute" is the cause of this?

[03:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've seen people use =false long before html5 came along.

[03:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
"flag attribute" is kinda hokey

[03:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: =false seems to show up with new HTML5 attributes

[03:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I don't remember seeing <input checked=false> too often, but I don't have scientific data

[03:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, but that's just because authors have a hard time understanding the whole concept of boolean attributes, not because they're called that

[03:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
and because the new attributes are often used without testing

[03:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
changing a term that is used that often in the spec is very disruptive and usually results in all kinds of mistakes that takes weeks to fix

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
so unless we have a really really good replacement term, i'm skeptical

[03:35:00.0000] <webben>
Hixie: I agree the attributes are confusing no matter what; I think "boolean attributes" is perhaps more confusing than "flag attributes" because people see "boolean" and think they know what that means.

[03:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not buying the asserted causality chain here

[03:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
and "flag attributes" is just terrible as a term

[03:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
Do normal people actually know what "boolean" means?

[03:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
(also i use the term "flag" all over the place)

[03:36:04.0000] <Philip`>
(i.e. people who aren't programmers or mathematicians)

[03:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: yeah that's one reason i don't really buy it

[03:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
enough people who write HTML by hand know enough about programming to know what a boolean is

[03:38:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: Exactly.

[03:38:01.0000] <jgraham>
I don't really like flag attributes

[03:38:02.0000] <jgraham>
It makes me think of the things that wave in the wind

[03:38:03.0000] <jgraham>
(but I also don't like boolean attributes because it does seem confusing)

[03:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
Call it a there-or-not attribute

[03:39:01.0000] <webben>
I think "boolean" confuses anybody with any experience of programming, on top of the attributes being confusing to everyone to begin with.

[03:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me finds the spec looks nothing like what he remembered

[03:39:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I guess you really want xdoc xref soon

[03:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought he really wanted it years ago

[03:40:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, yeah

[03:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: websockets is blocked on not having cross-doc xrefs

[03:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
(microsoft want them before we publish any further)

[03:40:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: I expect there will be something usable by the end of the month.

[03:40:05.0000] <Hixie>
sweeeeeeet

[03:40:06.0000] <Hixie>
how does it work?

[03:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
what input do i give it?

[03:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Basically the same as you give PMS now. I don't know how jgraham will want to deal with being given loads of files all at once, though.

[03:41:02.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, why does the W3C multi-page spec still contain microdata? http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/#auto-toc-5

[03:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: how do you work out what the URLs should be then?

[03:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: mike stopped regenning it i think, not sure

[03:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[03:42:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Oh, and it's quicker to generate all the WHATWG specs (excluding complete) than generating the "HTML" document alone with Anolis 1.

[03:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You tell it the URLs.

[03:42:03.0000] <Dashiva>
"Valueless attributes"

[03:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy, Hixie - I turned of the script that generates the multi-page version

[03:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: currently i only regen the changed ones

[03:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
the full version should be up to date

[03:43:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
one-page version

[03:43:04.0000] <gsnedders>
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/html5/spec/Overview.html?content-type=text/html still contains everything?

[03:43:05.0000] <Hixie>
no

[03:43:06.0000] <Lachy>
dammit, you're right about the microdata split making the spec silly. Section 6.1 Content models in the separate Microdata spec makes it more difficult to know the conformance requirements for the elements it changes :-(

[03:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You could get it to do that, but that will get complex when multiple files change and you need to get the right set of files.

[03:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: going forward are you saying i should just group the specs into the w3c ones, the whatwg ones, and complete, and have the cross-references work? i'm confused.

[03:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
There are two ways to deal with xref: either you pass all the source files at once, or you pass some of them and URLs for other files to load xref from.

[03:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(but in that case it can't add ids to the,)

[03:45:02.0000] <gsnedders>
*them

[03:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
hm so basically i could just generate each one, upload them, then generate them all again, upload that, and keep repeating until it converges? :-)

[03:45:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Sounds like bibtex

[03:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
You _could_.

[03:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is it guaranteed to converge?

[03:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I can't think of any way in which it wouldn't.

[03:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: can i give it a URL to load references from but give it a _different_ URL to actually use in the spec it outputs?

[03:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
No

[03:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: because then i wouldn't have to upload the drafts to the w3c

[03:47:04.0000] <Dashiva>
With all the talk of modularization and monoliths, this sounds like it would be a lot easier if the spec splitter was integrated with the cross referencer

[03:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
to do the converging

[03:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Wouldn't it be easier to just generate all the W3C specs at once, with some magic to deal with not regenning unchanged documents?

[03:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: and we could merge that with the html-to-ietf-draft convertor, too! :-)

[03:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like a similar problem to the linker for compiled programming languages, where you want to process a lot of source files individually and then fix up all the crossreferences later

[03:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: it's actually the opposite, since i start with one source file :-)

[03:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
except in this case the linker (Anolis) is doing a lot of the compilation too

[03:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: there are ten w3c drafts right now

[03:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: it sounds like i can deal with what you're describing

[03:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: Did you see adactio's comments about /html5 and /specs/ earlier?

[03:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: no? where? here?

[03:51:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah

[03:51:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Basically, /html5 no longer links to HTML5 (rather WHATWG HTML) and /specs/ is woefully incomplete and out of date

[03:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wouldn't want /html5 to redirect to HTML5, since all the links he's posted to /html5#foo would suddenly change to the single-page version that crashes people's browsers

[03:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i updated /specs/ recently

[03:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
is it better now?

[03:52:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I will let you know as soon as i get clue about the lockng problem

[03:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
 /html5 is supposed to redirect to the whatwg html page

[03:53:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It doesn't look changed to me: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/

[03:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
E.g. it doesn't mention WA 1.0

[03:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh, should it?

[03:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess it could

[03:54:03.0000] <adactio>
I think it's pretty ridiculous that the URL /html5 doesn't redirect to the HTML5 spec. Use /html to direct to HTML and /html5 to redirect to HTML5. I think it's pretty devious that all the links out there pointing to /html5 no longer point to the HTML5 spec.

[03:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
it is the HTML5 spec

[03:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
well, it's really the HTML6 spec

[03:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
or whatever you want to call it

[03:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's the spec that matters, anyway

[03:55:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: not having "HTML5" as the name of "the spec that matters" is a problem

[03:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
that's why it says "including html5"

[03:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: I don't have a strong opinion, but the page should at least be as informative as the FAQ entry.

[03:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(as far as communicating with people who don't follow #whatwg goes)

[03:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: well i don't want to have that information there twice... i guess i can just point to the FAQ entry?

[03:56:03.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Having HTML5 as the name would make people even angrier

[03:58:00.0000] <adactio>
Well, I'll just start pointing people to the W3C URLs because they seem to more trustworthy i.e. they aren't likely to suddenly change from one day to the next.

[03:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't convinced the process problems can be solved simply by selecting good names

[03:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me tries to understand how the different i5 or i7-branded CPUs might compare for compiling Firefox

[03:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: i'm not really sure i understand what it is that is changing in the whatwg one

[03:58:04.0000] <Dashiva>
How about calling it HTML.next instead of WHATWG HTML :)

[03:58:05.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: the w3c one is changing all the time -- e.g. they just took out microdata and the 2d context for no good reason

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in fairness, you took out the 2d context

[03:59:01.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: but at least the URL for HTML5 still points to a specification for HTML5.

[03:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: there was no chair decision for that

[03:59:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Not like it wasn't obvious what the chair decision would have been

[03:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: what do you call "html5"?

[04:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: there's nobody in the htmlwg asking for it to be kept in the spec except me and a handful of #whatwg regulars, as far as i can tell.

[04:00:01.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: the part of WHAT WG HTML in parentheses "(including HTML5)"

[04:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: OK

[04:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: so you think everything in the HTML spec on the WHATWG site except the <device> element is HTML5?

[04:01:01.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: Anybody coming to /html5 expecting to see a spec called HTML5 and instead discovering a spec called "HTML (including HTML5)" will want to know "Well, which bit is HTML5 because that's what I'm interested in"

[04:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thinks adactio is right

[04:01:03.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: the point is: *I don't know* anymore what HTML5 is.

[04:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: why would anyone care about HTML5, as opposed to what the latest HTML spec is? HTML5 is the last generation now.

[04:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: because HTML5 has all the hype

[04:02:01.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: because people like me are out there tell front end developers/designers: "you should really check out HTML5—it's got great stuff". They then go looking for something called HTML5.

[04:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i can't call the whatwg spec "html5" without making the even more confusing step of having the specs describe the term "html5" as being different sets of technology.

[04:03:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Because people want to claim to support "HTML5", because it is hard to support something that has changed in the time from layout-engine freeze to shipping

[04:03:02.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: now, should I instead be evangelising "HTML (including HTML5) because that's going to get very tiring to say/write/

[04:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: i would evangelise individual features, not buzzwords

[04:04:00.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: then, as I said, the safest thing for me to do is to point to W3C urls rather than WHATWG urls.

[04:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: why is that safer?

[04:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I suggest making /html5/ and /current-work/ point to something that corresponds to "HTML5"

[04:04:03.0000] <hsivonen>
or at least /html5/

[04:04:04.0000] <adactio>
What hsivonen said.

[04:04:05.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why we would want to hide <device> from people

[04:04:06.0000] <Hixie>
or is that not what you're asking for

[04:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really understand what you're asking for

[04:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
adactio, it doesn't matter. The whole point of it is to try and move away from versioned specs. The features that people can use depends solely on what is supported in implementations, not whether something happened to make the feature freeze cut off in the W3C process.

[04:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe "HTML (including HTML5)" should be deleted, and "HTML5" considered the 'main' HTML spec for now (and the same between W3C and WHATWG), and the new features split into separate specs (the "Devices for HTML" spec etc)

[04:05:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: does <device> have implementor buy-in?

[04:05:04.0000] <Philip`>
since that avoids the confusion of having multiple versions of HTML being promoted simultaneously

[04:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it has as much implementor interest at this stage as <video> did when we added that

[04:05:06.0000] <adactio>
Point /html to the "everything" spec (HTML including HTML5 and Device). Point /html5 to the subset that is HTML5. (as for what's in that subset: I don't know anymore—you tell me)

[04:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: do you think what is labeled "html5" should include any or all of .localStorage, web workers, websockets, geolocation, eventsource, or <device>, and if so, which ones?

[04:06:01.0000] <csarven>
Is readonly implied for <input type="hidden" ?

[04:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
adactio, other than the backwards W3C process, can you clearly explain why you think the distinction between HTML5 and the additional stuff is important?

[04:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: "5" is important when "5" has PR value

[04:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, that's not what I'm asking

[04:07:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: for better or worse, we have a number in the buzzword

[04:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: also add microdata, the canvas 2d graphics context, and elements like <progress> and <details> to that list, so i can better understand what you think is in html5 and what you think is out

[04:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
my question is regarding the distinction between the features that are officially in HTML5, and the features that are additional extras.

[04:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me guesses the HTML5 spec should have links to other "HTML5" technologies like geolocation too, to help users

[04:09:01.0000] <adactio>
Lachy: actually, no, I can't answer that, at least not easily. I just know that it smells bad to overload a spec with everything. I absolutely agree that 5 is a buzzword but it's got to mean something: a subset of "everything including the kitchen sink"

[04:09:02.0000] <Dashiva>
WHATWG HTML is a subset already, though

[04:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
"everything including the kitchen sink" is http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html

[04:09:04.0000] <Dashiva>
It's just a slightly larger subset

[04:09:05.0000] <Hixie>
(actual kitchen sink in the abstract)

[04:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
HTML5-the-buzzword pretty much covers everything that isn't covered by CSS3-the-buzzword...

[04:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/ excludes web storage, web workers, wob sockets, server sent events

[04:11:00.0000] <adactio>
Look: the current spec (located at /html5) has the title "HTML (including HTML5)". It's completely reasonable for someone to ask "Oh, which part of this spec is HTML5?". As for what that subset is, you tell me!

[04:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
adactio, so, in other words, your sole reason for this line of argument is purley an instinctive reaction to what you consider to be unexpected?

[04:11:02.0000] <adactio>
Least surprise.

[04:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
the w3c html5 spec excludes microdata, <device>, 2d context, postMessage, MessageChannel, web storage, web workers, wob sockets, server sent events

[04:11:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: adactio's question is perfectly reasonable considering the title

[04:11:05.0000] <adactio>
Lachy: yeah, right now the principle of least surprise is being violated by having /html5 redirect to a spec called HTML.

[04:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: ok, HTML5 is everything in the spec labeled "WHATWG HTML (including HTML5)", we just can't call it that because the w3c would lynch me.

[04:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"SVG is part of the HTML 5 family of technologies."

[04:13:01.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: so you know it really should just be called HTML5 ...but that would cause political problems.

[04:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: (no, it just doesn't apply because you can't edit it, it's not interactive)

[04:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: yes

[04:13:04.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: well, it really should just be called HTML, and we should move away from versioning

[04:13:05.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: but it can be called HTML5 for now if that buzzword hasn't had its day yet

[04:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: except it can't, because then the w3c and the whatwg would be disagreeing about what is in "html5"

[04:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: and that would be even worse

[04:14:02.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: I'm in favour of *not* confusing authors/developers even if it's at the expense of political harmony between organisations.

[04:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
you wouldn't have to bear the brunt of the disharmony

[04:14:04.0000] <Dashiva>
adactio: But it would confuse authors in a different way, since they'd see two HTML5 with different contents in the media

[04:14:05.0000] <Lachy>
call it HTML5++

[04:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
or HTML++

[04:15:01.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: then it sounds like I definitely should be pointing to W3C urls as being canonical.

[04:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders where political harmony comes in the priority of constituencies

[04:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: the W3C URLs are missing microdata, <device>, 2d context, postMessage, MessageChannel, web storage, web workers, wob sockets, and server sent events, is that what you want?

[04:15:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: The bureaucracy is always highest priority

[04:15:05.0000] <Philip`>
Wob sockets sound fun

[04:15:06.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: I *think* so, yes.

[04:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
(assuming by "the W3C URLs" you mean http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html)

[04:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: then go ahead :-)

[04:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: personally i think that's a pretty feeble "html5" :-)

[04:16:03.0000] <adactio>
We need some kind of name for the subset of HTML (i.e. HTML not including device, web storage, etc.). For historical reasons, the word HTML5 seems to be the best label for that subset.

[04:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are two subsets

[04:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's the subset that is only missing web storage, web workers, web sockets, and server sent events

[04:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's what i would call "HTML"

[04:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
then there's a further subset that's also missing microdata, <device>, 2d context, postMessage, and MessageChannel

[04:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
which the w3c currently calls "HTML5"

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
but then a few weeks ago they had all but <device> in there and they called _that_ HTML5

[04:18:01.0000] <Dashiva>
We have always been at war with Eurasia

[04:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
adactio, this table illustrates what's included in each version of the spec http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_various_versions_of_the_spec.3F

[04:19:01.0000] <adactio>
So it sounds like you need a new term to describe HTML5+device+microdata. Overloading the existing terms (HTML and HTML5) is not going to clarify anything.

[04:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: personally i'm interested more in making the web better than in making best use of buzzwords, so having <device> in HTML (and in the spec that I want people to review) is more important than calling it HTML5 to me

[04:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
IMHO, the complete Web Applications 1.0 spec is all that you should be concerned about. The rest is just a result of buraucracy

[04:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: microdata is part of HTML, whatever number it has on the end of it

[04:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
The web won't be made better if users don't understand what features exist and can't find where they're documented

[04:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
so the naming seems like an integral part of the betterment

[04:20:04.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: but clarity is important in getting authors to adopt this technology (and according to the priority of constituencies, they are important).

[04:21:00.0000] <adactio>
What Philp said.

[04:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: authors have been adopting thus stuff far faster than i'd like, so far

[04:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: it's actually caused problems already

[04:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
so i don't think that's a problem currently

[04:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
adactio: What if /html5 pointed to a copy that had only half of HTML5. Would that be okay?

[04:22:01.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: well, if the Orwellian naming conventions are an attempt to stop authors using this stuff, I think it will succeed.

[04:22:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Authors don't read specs, they read diveintohtml5

[04:22:03.0000] <adactio>
Dashiva: I don't even know what you mean when you say HTML5 ...which is really at the heart of the problem.

[04:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
Orwellian? the names are intended to be accurate.

[04:22:05.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think we can stop them from using things unless we get rid of markp :P

[04:22:06.0000] <Hixie>
let's not start exaggerating here.

[04:22:07.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: I apologise.

[04:23:00.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: but there's a certain "moving of the goalposts" feel going on.

[04:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
adactio: The heart of the problem, yes. Because at the w3c, what is HTML5 changes from day to day

[04:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: What'll happen if he wants to cover <device> in that book?

[04:23:03.0000] <Dashiva>
If enough people dislike it, suddenly a feature doesn't exist anymore

[04:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: well yeah, it's been 6 years since we've been working on HTML5, we _are_ moving the goalposts. Last year we got to Last Call on what is HTML "5", and now we're moving towards a versionless development model.

[04:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can't sell a book called "Dive into HTML" because nobody will realise it's new and not ten years old

[04:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: you just call it the 2010 edition

[04:24:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Release four pamphlets called "Dive into HTML 1-4" and then go for "Dive into HTML 5" 

[04:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[04:25:00.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: I appreciate that and I have no problem with it (I think it's a good move). But you must see that having a url with "5" in it (/html5) pointing to the ongoing versionless spec isn't helpful.

[04:25:01.0000] <csarven>
Sure, "Dive into HTMl 5 Last call" sounds great

[04:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
I'd imagine some people are still writing/updating books in 2010 that only cover HTML4/XHTML1

[04:25:03.0000] <Philip`>
so that doesn't help a reader know what technologies are covered in it

[04:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: i can't see what else we would point to

[04:25:05.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what would it take for you to reintegrate 2dcontext, postMessage and MessageChannel back into HTML5, given that they weren't taken out by a formal group decision anyway, so we can at least partially reduce the differences between WHATWG HTML and HTML5?

[04:25:06.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: Get a WG decision on it

[04:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and they'll only judge the book by its front cover, not by the bit on the back that lists all the features it talks about)

[04:26:01.0000] <adactio>
"Dive into what's known as 'HTML (including HTML5)' at the WHAT WG and HTML5 at the W3C" — catchy!

[04:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: object to the bugs where i did that and raise an issue

[04:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: but i doubt they would pass, that's why i made the changes

[04:26:04.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: the reasons that were applied to microdata apply equally to those

[04:26:05.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: it only has "(including HTML5)" in the name to address the concen you raised of people wondering if this was the right spec

[04:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: maybe the answer is to not bothe including that parenthetical

[04:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
the reasons that applied to microdata were bogus anyway

[04:27:02.0000] <Dashiva>
That doesn't really matter as long as the system considers it valid

[04:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: doesn't matter if they're bogus or not, apparently

[04:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
the real reason people wanted microdata out was just becaue some people would prefer that we didn't work on it at all, as clearly illustrated by the FPWD objections and calls to move it to a new mailing list

[04:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: obviously

[04:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If you ask me, we might as well get WG decisions on all these sections sooner rather than later

[04:29:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Might be able to free up some bandwidth on public-html

[04:29:02.0000] <adactio>
I'm seeing the start of a disturbing precedent here. When anyone* files a bug about any feature of HTML5 (the W3C spec), it gets removed from that spec but remains in the WHAT WG spec. At that point, what's the point of having mailing lists or any attempt at discussion. (*usually Shelley) 

[04:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
i guess if we get the chairs to decide on lots of splits, the w3c spec will be such a mess that adactio won't want to point to it anymore, and he'll go back to pointing to the whatwg one :-)

[04:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, they might decide in a dozen different ways

[04:30:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But as long as the decisions are made, that's one thing less to waste time on

[04:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: the whatwg mailing list is still a useful way of getting input from a broad range of people and a useful way of contributing to the spec.

[04:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: can't speak about the w3c lists, but then i've mostly given up on them at this point.

[04:31:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh look, MLW is at it

[04:31:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Darn, old content

[04:32:00.0000] <adactio>
I'm perfectly fine with the spec called HTML5 (as hosted by the W3C) being a subset of the spec called HTML (as hosted by the WHAT WG) but two is plenty: let's try not to splinter it any further than that.

[04:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's already splintered further than that at the w3c

[04:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
the htmlwg already has four specs

[04:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Does that include RDFa?

[04:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
html5, microdata, 2dcontext, and postMessage/MessageChannel

[04:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
rdfa is going into its own group

[04:33:03.0000] <csarven>
So, I have a question; when authors, developers want to look up the spec for how x supposed to work, where do you think they will head to? HTML(WHATWG) or HTML5(W3C) ?

[04:33:04.0000] <Dashiva>
... then why did we publish a FPWD in the first place?

[04:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: probably whichever google takes them to for their query

[04:34:01.0000] <csarven>
This is going to be a mess

[04:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's already a mess

[04:34:03.0000] <Dashiva>
csarven: They probably won't go to a spec at all

[04:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
csarven: if they've tried using both before, they'll probably end up reusing the whatwg one, since it's got more of the content in one place

[04:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
rather than being split into four pieces

[04:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: how about if i rename the WHATWG HTML spec to "HTML5 (including next generation additions still in development)" or something?

[04:39:00.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: I think that would make life much, much better for curious authors/developers/designers looking to find out more about this thing they keep hearing about. Yes!

[04:39:01.0000] <Dashiva>
HTML5++ doesn't seem so bad in comparison

Dashiva: C++ is horrible compared to C

[04:39:03.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: Although I appreciate that this is just postponing the issue of moving to a numberless nomenclature.

[04:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: But compared to C (including next generation additions still in development)?

[04:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, it might be useful to clearly enumerate the additional sections included in HTML5++. The abstract currently only mentions the device element, and probably wouldn't hurt to list 2d context, postMessage and MessageChannel.

[04:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh i guess yeah, i should list that those things are included

[04:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't think of that

[04:42:02.0000] <Dashiva>
And it might useful to mention which were at some point in HTML5, and which were never

[04:42:03.0000] <Lachy>
Or maybe mark the headdings of those sections in some way, or at least their TOC entires, in some way that makes it obvious that they're added extras

[04:42:04.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: I definitely think it would be clearer to label the spec "HTML5 (plus x, y, z)" rather than "HTML (including HTML5)".

[04:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, let me poke around and see what i can do

[04:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me thinks he agrees with adactio's original position i.e. the whatwg should call HTML5 the set of things that htmlwg is working on currently and "HTML" the mainline of HTML development

[04:43:02.0000] <adactio>
Hixie: Thank you. Much appreciated.

[04:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I wonder if I care enough about "boolean attributes" to escalate the bug to the Decision Process

[04:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
if you care that much, reopen the bug with a better name

[04:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
i did kind of like the earlier suggestion of "valueless attribute"

[04:50:02.0000] <csarven>
Isn't the value implied?

[04:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"valueless" isn't technically correct

[04:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
"presence attributes" would be

[04:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
the name is indeed not technically correct

[04:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
i considered "presence attribute" but nobody would understand that

[04:51:04.0000] <hsivonen>
but "presence attributes" is weirder than "flag attributes"

[04:51:05.0000] <Hixie>
"valueless" has the advantage of discouraging people from giving values

[04:52:00.0000] <csarven>
(just playing here) Was 'null attributes' mentioned? Not that great but..

[04:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It has a value, but the content of the value has no importance

[04:54:01.0000] <csarven>
How strict should validation be? What if it said, if this attribute has a value, UAs can ignore it

[04:55:00.0000] <csarven>
s/can/should

[04:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems weird to say <input checked="checked"> is a valid valueless attribute

[04:58:00.0000] <Huvet>
I think the trickiest problem here is to explain why autobuffer="false" means that the element _will_ autobuffer... it's hard to explain without going balobas with technical terms

[05:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
We could call them Descartes attributes on the basis that if they exist they are

[05:01:01.0000] <Huvet>
:)

[05:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
What terms do existing books and tutorials etc use to refer to those attributes?

[05:03:01.0000] <Huvet>
I think I like to call them valueless still... it could be argued that checked="checked" is just a longer form of "checked"

[05:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's a form of "checked" which has a value

[05:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
so it's clearly not valueless :-p

[05:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it's still a flag, though

[05:04:03.0000] <Philip`>
Also "valueless attribute" sounds like "pointless worthless attribute" to me

[05:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh that's a good term too

[05:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me ducks

[05:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#is-this-html5?

[05:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
adactio: does that work?

[05:07:02.0000] <Huvet>
<attribute>checked</attribute>=<value>"checked"</value> <- valueless makes sense! :)

[05:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"set attribute"

[05:08:01.0000] <Dashiva>
As oppose to map attribute :D

[05:08:02.0000] <Dashiva>
+d

[05:08:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: "only even been" - should be "ever"?

[05:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
fixed thanks

[05:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Features that are part of HTML5 (and this specification) but that have been published as separate specifications in the past (or indeed currently, at the W3C):" - why doesn't that list include e.g. Web Forms 2, which was published separately in the past?

[05:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i just changed that sentence to the present tense

[05:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i guess i should list wf2, yeah

[05:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, why is the content of /current-work/ different from /current-work/multipage/ now?

[05:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
/multipage/ only updates when i check in the cahnges

[05:11:02.0000] <Lachy>
ah, ok

[05:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
adactio, Philip`: ok, regenned with the changes

[05:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me checks in the changes

[05:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok it's nearly 5:30am, long past anything I should consider my bed time

[05:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
But you do consider it your bed time anywa.

[05:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's only a "should", he's allowed to violate it

[05:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
Does this coult as a good justification?

[05:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
*count

[05:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:27:01.0000] <webben>
night Hixie

[05:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, since you were the one who convinced me that we should try adding queryScopedSelector, do you have anything to add to the current discussion about whether or not we should keep it?

[05:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I'm slogging my way through public-html right now - will look at that thread next

[05:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
JohnResig, I'd also like to hear from you on the issue, if you've got time, and I'm still interested to hear the alternative proposals you once told me you had.

[05:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, ok.

[05:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What list is this discussion on?

[05:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I'd guess webapps

[05:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, public-webapps

[05:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
see the recent selectors api 2 thread

[05:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Subscribed and checking archives now.

[05:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2010JanMar/thread.html#msg62

[05:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: are you going to have time to write a counter-proposal for the dt/dd issue?

[05:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but I thought Lachy was already writing something up for it.  When you need it by?

[05:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if I don't see one by tomorrow, I'll sign up for doing it myself (or just actually write one)

[05:58:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ok.

[05:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the deadline is the 16th IIRC but I don't want to wait until the last minute if I have to do it myself

[05:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy doing it is fine

[05:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
just wanna make sure it gets done

[06:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
I put it on the whatwg wiki, hoping some others might contribute to the proposals they liked

[06:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Change_Proposal:_figure_and_details

[06:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
also, if you guys could review the rationale against dt/dd, that would be useful

[06:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: ah, sweet

[06:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, you might like to do proposal 6, for the <p summary> idea

[06:05:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Will do.

[06:05:02.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, I'm guessing you can do fcaption/dlabel

[06:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: that looks like a good template, very useful

[06:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems like all that's needed to turn this into actual Change Proposals is:

[06:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
1) Pick one of the proposals.

[06:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
2) Update the Summary to reflect it accurately.

[06:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
3) Update Rationale to explain why it is better than other proposed changes for this (e.g. why better than <fltcap>, why better than the others here).

[06:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
4) Flesh out proposal details.

[06:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
5) Write Impact.

[06:07:03.0000] <othermaciej>
6) Post somewhere in W3C space.

[06:07:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I will do those steps for fcaption/dlabel

[06:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would prefer not to be first but in any case I intend to do it by tomorrow night.

[06:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: would you prefer to be listed as co-author or not?

[06:08:02.0000] <Lachy>
I figured once we get the proposal details written for a few of them (not necessarily all of them), then we can submit them each as individual change proposals, but they can each share the rationale against dt/dd, and provide their own rationale in favour of the particular proposal

[06:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: ok, I'll fill in those bits in the wiki first

[06:14:00.0000] <adactio>
Lachy: I think that's a very good change proposal document but I think it would be better as two documents: one for figure and one for details. I know that these documents would be almost identical in their rationale but crucially, the change proposals would be more specific to the particular element.

[06:15:00.0000] <adactio>
For example, Proposal 4 is really two different proposals.

[06:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I'm not sure I follow the Legacy Cruft point

[06:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: are you saying that the workaround <div> will persist past its point of usefulness?

[06:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: on "Default Styles", I assume UA stylesheets will eventually give "figure > dt" and such separate style rules, but I guess it matters for the intermediate period

[06:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I can make edits to clarify these points myself if you prefer

[06:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's what I meant about the extra <div>. I wasn't sure if that was a particularly strong argument, but I left it in there anyway

[06:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
you can go ahead and make whatever changes you like

[06:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All right, proposal six is filled in.  Lachy, do you need any of the others in particular filled in?

[06:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think folks should fill in whichever ones they personally believe in

[06:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure, but I believe in a few of them.

[06:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: you filled in a rationale for Proposal 6 relative to other proposals, but I don't see a fleshed out "Proposal Details"

[06:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, feel free to fill in details for any that you like

[06:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: i.e. the details of what exactly should change in the spec

[06:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, indeed.

[06:56:03.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: I intend to do #3 and I'll have subsections marked "Summary", "Additional Rationale", "Details" and "Impact"

[07:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
k done

[07:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: it might be a couple of hours til I can read and comment on the webapps thread

[07:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I made a few edits to your Rationale

[07:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I'd like to add one more Rationale point if it is ok with you

[07:27:02.0000] <othermaciej>
specifically, aesthetics

[07:27:03.0000] <othermaciej>
actually, let me go ahead and add it, and you tell me if you hate it

[07:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, sure

[07:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
I sort of touched on the aesthetics issues in the Unwanted Elements section

[07:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
where I said it was unappealing to authors. But it might be worth making it clearer

[07:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, you seem to have omitted any details about how or where the caption attribute is defined and which elements it can be used on

[07:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: done

[07:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
feel free to edit that bit

[07:33:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which elements = all.

[07:33:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I also added a dt to "Unnecessary Elements"

[07:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: you have to describe the actual spec changes - would it be described next to "id" or next to "hidden" (those are in different sections)? how would the content model of affected elements change? what happens if you use @caption in a disallowed context?

[07:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: look at the level of detail in Shelley's Change Proposal

[07:34:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, got it.  Adding that now.

[07:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, the unnecessary elements section was giving an example of where there is no caption.

[07:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Actually, I'm looking at the level of detail in time's definition of pubdate, since that's pretty much exactly what I want.

[07:35:02.0000] <Lachy>
maybe the prose could be updated to reflect the addition of dt to the example though

[07:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: oh, sorry, I'll revert

[07:35:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I missed that

[07:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
it doesn't matter. I don't mind if you revert the example, or just change the preceding line introducing it

[07:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I reverted the example

[07:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I thought it was a mistake, I don't have an opinion on which way works better

[07:40:00.0000] <Huvet>
I think I found another html5lib bug. I get maximum recursion depth, and when I make a testcase I get this: "<object </body></html>"

[07:40:01.0000] <Huvet>
someone forgot to close an object starting tag

[07:40:02.0000] <Huvet>
I'll file a bug

[07:46:00.0000] <Huvet>
http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/issues/detail?id=132

[07:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: looking at what you have so far - you still need to describe where and how the caption attribute as a global attribute will be defined, and when it is valid to use

[07:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Huvet: Does the traceback make it look like it's in an infinite loop?

[07:47:01.0000] <Huvet>
yes, I cut off 500 lines or so in the traceback

[07:47:02.0000] <Huvet>
"<cut 500+ lines of exceptions> "

[07:47:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've done that now, you may have viewed the page slightly too early.

[07:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Huvet: So it's just the same few over and over again? OK.

[07:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Huvet: There will be some extreme cases where a conforming document could cause a stack depth error, but that wouldn't loop between a few states

[07:49:00.0000] <Huvet>
this is just line 1279 and line 460, back and forth

[07:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: what about changes to the details element?

[07:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: per your suggestion it seems like caption is valid even on elements that are not in a <figure> or <details>

[07:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
is that really your intent?

[07:50:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
This doesn't affect the <details> element - I don't think it's appropriate there.  I'm fine with <dt>/<dd> for <details>, or any of the new-element suggestions.

[07:50:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm, no.  I worded it wrongly there.

[07:50:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Should be invalid, not ignored.

[07:50:05.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: then you should update your summary to say your change is to make this change for figure but leave details as-is

[07:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ok.

[07:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Not quite familiar with the spec conventions - does anything else need to be said about an invalid attribute?  Is it implied that it should have no effect?

[07:52:00.0000] <Huvet>
gsnedders: http://pastebin.com/m2ab28d90

[07:52:01.0000] <Huvet>
that's the full one

[07:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: "invalid" and "no effect" are orthogonal - you'd have to say both if you mean both

[07:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[07:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the spec normally says "MUST NOT" rather than "invalid" but people will get what you mean

[07:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Right, yeah. Great.

[07:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Huvet: Probably quite easy to fix though

[07:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(e.g. "The caption attribute MUST NOT be applied to elements that are not a child of a figure or details element."

[07:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: is it ok to have more than one child in a figure with @caption on it?

[07:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: is it ok for the caption to be in the middle instead of first or last?

[07:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
"If multiple children of a figure element have the content attribute set, it is invalid on all such elements beyond the first, and has no effect."  <-- new text

[07:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(current spec doesn't allow multiple captions or caption in the middle)

[07:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, you can put the @caption attribute anywhere within the <figure>'s content.

[08:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I... I think my 404 page just got spammed.

[08:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins, Lachy: I wrote the Summary and Additional Rationale for Proposal 3

[08:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, "The body parts of these elements would not have any additional markup." doesn't really make sense.

[08:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: yeah that is poorly worded

[08:20:02.0000] <Lachy>
I assume you're not trying to imply that they're empty elements. Maybe you want to say that they can contain phrasing content

[08:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what I mean is that there's no replacement for <dd>, you just put the actual contents right in

[08:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, right. I totally misunderstood what you were trying to say

[08:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, wiki links are done using the syntax like this: [http://example.com/ Link Text], rather than <a> elements

[08:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I can do that - annoying that both ways work

[08:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
it doesn't appear to work when I look at the page.

[08:26:02.0000] <Lachy>
it's showing up literally as: "it seems to refer to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=floating+caption&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">captions overlayed on top of the image</a> ..."

[08:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's quite a well written rationale.

[08:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
all right, hang on

[08:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, "All HTML elements may have the caption content attribute set" is directly contradicted by "The caption attribute is invalid and has no effect on any element that is not a direct child of a figure element."

[08:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
No it's not.  All elements may have it set.  However, they must be in that particular context.

[08:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
there are elemnets like <html>, <body>, etc. would never be allowed to have it, cause they can't be children of figure

[08:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, got you.

[08:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: addressed both those comments

[08:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
you probably want to say it can be on any element in the Flow Content category

[08:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thanks, I was just about to ask if I should say something about flow content elements.

[08:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, it still doesn't quite read correctly, becuase the subject from the previous sentence is the fcaption and dlabel elements, rather than figure and details. It might be better to say:

[08:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
"The content portions of the figure and details elements would not have any special markup, it would be nested directly inside them."

[08:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, still doesn't quite work

[08:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
maybe "The content portions of the figure and details elements would not have any specialised markup; any other flow content may be used"

[08:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, btw, I'm considering raising an objection to the 2d canvas api split. But I haven't had time to review the changes that were made and what impact it has had

[08:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: it would be within your rights to escalate it then, if you decide to object

[08:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
I recall there were good arguments against doing so back when the issue was heavily discussed on the list

[08:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
I will have to look those up later

[08:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, what would be an acceptable process for getting microdata reinstated? I assume I would have to wait for new information, such as new implementations and evidence of adoption by developers to reopen the issue

[08:43:00.0000] <daedb>
TabAtkins: If caption can be on any flow content element, wouldn't <figure><img><style scoped caption></style></figure> be valid? That would be kinda weird :)

[08:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: the Working Group Decision gave specific examples of what kinds of new information might be a sound basis for re-raising the issue

[08:43:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, ok. I don't recall seeing anything mentioned about that. I'll take another look

[08:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
daedb: Weird, yes.  Worth worrying about?  I dunno.

[08:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't know if there is a categorization that captures "every element that you use to present content of some sort".

[08:50:00.0000] <daedb>
oh, video is flow content... I could have images in figures with video captions :D

[08:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, that's a problem with your proposal you will have to sort out

[08:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
it's one of the reasons I don't particularly like it

[08:50:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
deadb: Yes, yes you can.

[08:50:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: oh man, I'd been ignoring that thread in the hopes that there wasn't anything relevant (re queryScopedSelector)

[08:50:05.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: (fwiw I would object to the canvas api split if it weren't for the WHATWG copy of the spec. However assuming logic is applied consistently there microdata decision sets precedent for everything that is not in HTML4 to be split out of HTML5, so I would be surprised if such an objection were not futile)

[08:50:06.0000] <Lachy>
since there's no clear, inuitive subset of elements that it makes sense on

[08:51:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/there/the/

[08:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: There is a clear, intuitive subset.  That subset just isn't currently labelled in HTML.

[08:51:02.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I don't think the microdata decision "sets precedent for everything that is not in HTML4 to be split out of HTML5"

[08:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I do think there are some valid arguments for splitting the canvas API, and even Hixie has agreed at various points in time that it was good in principle to do so, though he didn't have time

[08:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
now, apparently, he has time

[08:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: If "limited success in the marketplace" is a sufficient reason for splitting, it follows that anything new could be split

[08:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: e.g. I would expect the same argument to hold if someone asked for <video> to be split

[08:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: the Working Group Decision only said that all of those arguments are effective in combination (in particular with the "don't pick winners" argument) and really only as they apply to the facts of Microdata

[08:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: also, <video> clearly has a lot more traction than Microdata at present - it has multiple client-side implementations and sites (including some prominent sites like daringfireball.net and youtube.com) using it in production or as a future technology demo

[08:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: do you really sincerely think that <video> and Microdata have equivalent levels of adoption? (let alone of potentially competing alternatives)

[08:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh, <video> definitely has an extremely popular and well-entrenched alternative - Flash embedded video.

[08:58:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: If <video> disappeared tommorrow, hardly anyone would notice. Almost no-one is using <video> on a day-to-day basis.

[08:58:01.0000] <jgraham>
(I note in passing that the critria of reusability in other specifications would also apply equally well to <video>)

[08:58:02.0000] <jgraham>
(perhaps better)

[09:07:00.0000] <cardona507>
I'm pretty sure that if <video> disappeared tomorrow people would know - there seems to be quite a buzz for <audio> & <video>

[09:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: people have had whole conferences about how to use <video>

[09:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: I think a proprietary competing technology is not quite the same thing as a competing standard

[09:09:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
A valid critique.

[09:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it arguably *is* the W3C's place to pick a winner between standards-based and proprietary solutions

[09:09:03.0000] <cardona507>
when I mention HTML5 in html/css class <audio> & <video> often get the most and easiest "wow"

[09:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that being said, 

[09:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Almost no users would notice, web developers would notice.

[09:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
If video died.

[09:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the point is moot if no one actually asks for <video> to be removed

[09:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's clear that a lot of the opposition to Microdata was because it had a standards-based competitor that some people liked more.

[09:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That doesn't apply to any (?) other new feature in HTML5.

[09:11:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although, some people also feel really strongly about how big specs should be, too.

[09:11:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me shrugs

[09:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
If that was the reason for the decision it would have been nice if it was just stated. Then it would be clear that it didn't apply to other things

[09:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It was mentioned in some fashion, wasn't it?

[09:16:01.0000] <foolip>
well, at least it was obvious that it was the actual reason to all involved

[09:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: It was mentioend in the discusion but not actually given as the reason

[09:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/the/a/

[09:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: "Many of the objections balance out. But, in some areas, keeping Microdata would draw stronger objections than splitting it. The objections based on maturity, market success, and reusability in other languages are stronger than their respective counterpoints. In light of these other arguments, the objections to picking a winner in this case are stronger than the objections to not doing so. The objections to picking either RDF

[09:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Microdata as a winner were stronger, on the whole, than the objections to letting them compete on an equal footing."

[09:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: the "pick a winner" argument is clearly stated in the Short Summary and given a lot of prominence both there and in the longer discussion

[09:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But it wasn't picking. RDFa didn't want to be in HTML5 at all.

[09:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, the problem I have with that statement is that splitting it out does not really let them compete on an equal footing. Instead, it forces the Microdata proponents to adapt to a new way of developing the spec that they're not particularly comfortable with

[09:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: you could debate whether the reasoning provided by commentors was valid, but what we're discussing now is whether it "sets precedent for everything that is not in HTML4 to be split out of HTML5, so I would be surprised if such an objection were not futile)"

[09:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
which I think is not the case

[09:36:00.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: Fair enough. To me the list of three arguments is the essence of the summary

[09:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
That would have been my argument against the split, but since I was on holidays at the time the poll was called and didn't really have time, I missed out on contributing

[09:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: the chairs intended it somewhat the other way around, so apologies if the summary gave the wrong impression

[09:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I think if you read the detailed reasoning, I think it is more clear

[09:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, I don't really want to revisit this issue to death (better to move on), but I did want to note that it does not mean every other proposed split or removal is an automatic winner

[09:40:01.0000] <jgraham>
So given an arbitary part of the spec to which one can apply all three arguments with the same level of conviction as with microdata, it would not necessarilly be split out if someone requested that unless there was another W3C spec in the same space?

[09:40:02.0000] <Dashiva>
othermaciej: So you're saying that a contentious (if not outright invalid) argument was the real decider

[09:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's good you didn't say that, because if you did then someone would have proposed splitting <span> to its own spec.

[09:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: really it was the combination of all four facors with the real decider

[09:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Come on, people, this is politics, let's just drop it and move on to something else, hopefully non-editorial.

[09:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
s/with/which was/

[09:41:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although it looks like we still have lots more editorial stuff to argue about.

[09:41:04.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: I'm not sure if you've noticed, Shelley has filed close to a dozen new issues already

[09:41:05.0000] <Dashiva>
This isn't going away any time soon

[09:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, Shelley is why we still have lots more editorial stuff to argue about.

[09:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: if someone could show that all the arguments applied equally to some other section, that would likely be precedent for a split

[09:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: likewise that the balance did not fall the other way on any other arguments

[09:42:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Besides, doesn't SMIL pretty much fill RDFa's role when it comes to <video> and choosing a winner? :)

[09:42:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think it's become pretty clear that making a WG where any random person from the Internet can trigger lengthy bureaucratic processes over anything they disagree with is a bad idea.

[09:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Normally WGs (including W3C WGs and the WHATWG) are made up of a small number of people, mostly paid by interested organizations, which typically have a direct interest in progressing the spec.

[09:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And anyone else can comment, but can be ignored out of hand if the actual members disagree.

[09:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if Shelley overuses the process then I expect the Chairs will take some action to keep it from turning into a DOS attack

[09:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me can't wait.

[09:43:04.0000] <Dashiva>
So you're saying she isn't overusing it yet?

[09:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, don't you remember what Hixie said?  The chairs can't decide anything except on Tuesdays.  :)

[09:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, yeah

[09:44:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It's a shame othermaciej has to be the messenger here

[09:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
she's got 9 issues open out of the total 35 by my count

[09:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
wait, 11

[09:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but ISSUE-76 should be closed

[09:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Impressive.

[09:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And she opened, what, 7 of them the last two days?

[09:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
10/34 is a somewhat suspiciously high number

[09:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am looking for two more pieces of information before I decide whether it is a problem:

[09:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What is it if you count all issues, not just open ones?

[09:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
1) will she end up pursuing all of these as Change Proposals? (doesn't cost the group much time if the issue gets closed without prejudice)

[09:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Less than 20%, by my estimate

[09:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
2) what proportion of these issues end up being things that anyone but Shelley agrees with? (if any of them really represent the WG view, then it's not a waste of tiem)

[09:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
3) how many other issues will we get out of the recent batch of bug closures?

[09:48:03.0000] <othermaciej>
we have 4 sitting there with TrackerRequest

[09:48:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
There are 90-something issues, and most of them came about before Shelly went on her issue-spree, so most of them won't be hers.

[09:48:05.0000] <othermaciej>
and probably more that people have not looked yet

[09:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe there are 98 total and at least 12 are hers

[09:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for example if someone makes a Change Proposal and there is clearly not significant support for it, the chairs can just put forth a CfC to reject it instead of a call for counter-proposals

[09:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
not saying we will actually do that in any particular case but people should consider that before filing potentially frivolous issues

[09:51:01.0000] <webben>
What was the reason every Change Proposal has counter-proposals again?

[09:52:00.0000] <webben>
Why can't you just have a Change Proposal and solicit objections?

[09:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Mostly, to group the objections together.

[09:52:02.0000] <Dashiva>
That's basically what a counter-proposal is

[09:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
originally our intent was just to do it for old issues where there is no prior rationale from the editor

[09:52:04.0000] <Dashiva>
"Proposal: Change nothing. Rational: ..."

[09:52:05.0000] <othermaciej>
but I think it works better than just collecting objections by email

[09:52:06.0000] <Dashiva>
*Rationale

[09:52:07.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: Yeah, but with microdata you had a counter-proposal, a proposal and then a load of objections to both on top.

[09:52:08.0000] <othermaciej>
what is the right wiki syntax for a bulleted list?

[09:53:00.0000] <Dashiva>
*

[09:53:01.0000] <Dashiva>
No empty lines between items

[09:54:00.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: Since the chairs needed to read all the objections anyway, I don't see the point.

[09:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
my problem was leading spaces

[09:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
fixt

[09:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
webben: reading both Change Proposals plus the poll responses was way less work than reading every single mailing list response would have been

[09:55:01.0000] <webben>
othermaciej: But was it less work than reading a Change Proposal + poll responses would have been?

[09:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
webben: it helped focus the key arguments

[09:57:00.0000] <webben>
Fair enough.

[09:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
webben: we tried to look at the poll responses by how they related to one proposal or the other's rationale

[09:57:02.0000] <webben>
If it works, it works :)

[12:33:00.0000] <cardona507>
Firefox 3.6 release candidate out with support for the HTML5 File API - nice

[12:35:00.0000] <cardona507>
ohhh - it looks like there are all kinds of goodies in Firefox 3.6 :)

[12:38:00.0000] <miketaylr>
i think <input type=file multiple> as well

[12:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Heck, even my cat has her own domain name."

[13:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  This is an interesting border-radius bug.  Never seen it before.

[13:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, never mind.  It's a repainting issue.

[13:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm so persuaded by my rationale for Proposl 3 that I'm not sure I can bring myself to write any others

[13:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haha.

[13:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(the only other one I *might* do at this point is Proposal 4, but I don't know if I will)

[13:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and I still have to write the remaining bits of Proposal 3

[13:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have to say that Proposal 4 is my favorite.

[13:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dang, I mean 3.

[13:18:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Followed by 6, then 2 and 4 equally.

[13:18:03.0000] <jgraham>
pointer?

[13:18:04.0000] <othermaciej>
ah, I was gonna say

[13:18:05.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Change_Proposal:_figure_and_details

[13:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
we should just go ahead and call the spec "HTML Microdata", since we're basically trying to move away from versioning. Leif's seems like hte easiest objection ever to get withdrawn

[13:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: 4 is the hardest to write, because it requires parser changes

[13:19:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
As opposed to 1?

[13:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the parser changes for 1 are already in the spec

[13:19:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, right.  Commented out.

[13:19:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't wanna write 4, then.

[13:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh really? I thought it still had the parsing change for <legend> still in

[13:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh, maybe.  Hopefully so, actually.

[13:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I will consider writing 4 if it seems likely to be anyone's favorite

[13:20:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but describing changes to the parsing algorithm in detail is not my idea of a fun time

[13:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And I don't understand the parsing algorithm sufficiently well to write it at all.

[13:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think we should give up on proposal 4. If the caption element could be salvaged in any way, we would have done it when the parsing algorithm was written. I find it highly unlikely that any proposal for it would work in practice

[13:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
also, we'd be stuck with the legacy for many years to come

[13:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
We should drop 1 in that case as well.  It has equivalent problems, it's just easier to write a change proposal for.

[13:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, the problems with 1 were the whole reason we got where we are today. I don't think it will go over well with the community

[13:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
though, IMHO, legend is the second best alternative to introducing a new element

[13:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
at this stage, now that I've read the rationale behind it, I think 3 sounds the most promising. The names aren't ideal, but they're not overly bad

[13:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
Did I already mention that I find fcaption and dlabel mysterious names

[13:24:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The parallel to the naming of <table>'s sub-elements is nice, at least.

[13:25:00.0000] <jgraham>
figcaption (like optgroup) would be better for the figure one imho

[13:25:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Are they any more mysterious than thead, if you discount your existing familiarity?

[13:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
TabAtkins: It is hard to discount my existing familiarity

[13:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
True.  Rationally, then, are they any more mysterious?

[13:26:02.0000] <jgraham>
But <thead>, <tbody>, etc. are basically never used whereas <figcaption> would be used for every single <figure>

[13:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
<tr> and <td> are used on every table, though.

[13:27:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though their commonality may be sufficient justication by itself for their short names.

[13:27:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Simply from a bandwidth pov.

[13:27:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
(network and finger-based)

[13:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
But that is OK because both parts are abbreviated and the structure is such that you want short names more than you want readability

[13:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is <figcaption> sufficiently better than <figurecaption> to justify the shortening?  Is the parallel to <optgroup> strong enough to justify it?

[13:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
<figcaption> feels a lot shorter and using fig. as an abbreviation of figure is rather common

[13:29:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
True.

[13:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Is there any parallel name for <dlable> that feels natural?

[13:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/dlable/dlabel/

[13:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe <summary> but it is not quite right and doesn't capture the labelness if that is how we expect it to be used

[13:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, that sounds odd to me.

[13:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
(It is not clear to me if people will do things like <details><dlabel>[lots of contnet here]</dlabel>[more content here]</details>

[13:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The clickability parallel with form labels is nice enough that I want to keep "label" in it.

[13:32:02.0000] <jgraham>
(The other possible pattern is <details>label<expansion></expansion></details>

[13:32:03.0000] <jgraham>
)

[13:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
<content>?

[13:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That makes it too easy to do <details>foo<content>bar</content>baz</details>.  Of course, that might still be good...

[13:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
No, we might want that as a parallel to <header> et. al. one day

[13:33:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I think that most commonly it's the label that will be styled specially, so it's best to make that have the wrapper.

[13:34:00.0000] <jgraham>
I think it is also common to want the expansion to have a special style e.g. some extra margin

[13:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I wouldn't have a problem with tweaking the proposal to <figcaption> or <figurecaption> instead of <fcaption> if that is truly more popular, and if there is a good similar change for <label>

[13:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
er, good similar change for <details>

[13:35:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: Agreed, and that's why I'm still honestly fine with <dt>/<dd> for details.

[13:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but I do think names for specialized child elements often have either no prefix or an abbreviated prefix and rarely have a full-word prefix

[13:36:01.0000] <jgraham>
My feat with <dlabel> is just that; people will write <label> by mistake when they mean <dlabel>

[13:36:02.0000] <jgraham>
*fear

[13:36:03.0000] <othermaciej>
well I'd just propose <label> if I thought it would fly :-)

[13:36:04.0000] <othermaciej>
but the fact that using <label> will result in none of your content showing up should be a good enough signal to limit that error

[13:36:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, <label> doesn't have parsing problems.  You'll just be prevented from embedding form controls in the details label until browsers know to treat it differently.

[13:37:00.0000] <daedb>
<figurecaption> is too long imo. I'd prefer <fcaption> over <figcaption> for length reasons too, but I could live with both.

[13:37:01.0000] <jgraham>
Embedding form controls in the details label seems like it is a valid use case though

[13:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I agree, but it's a less drastic problem than parsing issues.

[13:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in particular you are much less likely to want a form control inside the <details> label than in a figure caption

[13:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the way it is used on Mac OS X, it pretty much never contains controls

[13:39:01.0000] <daedb>
Really? I expect form controls in <details> to be quite common.

[13:39:02.0000] <jgraham>
Yes but Web developers on't have to conform with the apple HIG :)

[13:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
daedb: in <details>, yes, in the label part, no

[13:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
the name <content> is out anyway, since it clashes with XBL, and it was already considered and rejected when we were discussing the idea of introducing a content wrapper for section elements

[13:40:02.0000] <jgraham>
(I can imagine something where you have a list of checkboxes, each of which is a details control that allows you to set more advanced options for that item. Not great UI perhaps but the sort of thing that seems plausible)

[13:40:03.0000] <Dashiva>
othermaciej: Were you smiling to yourself when you wrote "touch base" in that email? :)

[13:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh, I was just typing up that precisely, jgraham.

[13:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Dashiva: why would I be?

[13:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: I guess that is plausible

[13:41:03.0000] <daedb>
othermaciej: oh, I was just thinking in general, not just for the label... oops :)

[13:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so is anyone here a big fan of 1, 2, 4 or 5?

[13:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
To me it's too cliche to consider seriously

[13:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm sort of a2 fan, but that's all.

[13:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
also, would it be a good thing to mention this wiki page on the HTML WG, in case any other WG participants would like to fill in the details for any of those?

[13:42:04.0000] <daedb>
I like the shortness of <c> in 2.

[13:42:05.0000] <othermaciej>
or otherwise share our rationale

[13:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
<label> was rejected for use within <figure> since it clashes with form control labels. Perhaps the fact that it needs to be first in <details> would be enough to make the distincition.

[13:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
yeah, i think so, othermaciej 

[13:43:02.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: No, I would happily throw them all out :)

[13:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: it also seemed to me that using form controls legitimately in the figure caption might be more likely, but I'm not as sure now

[13:44:01.0000] <daedb>
I like 2 and 3 the most, then 6... don't care about the rest.

[13:44:02.0000] <othermaciej>
jgraham: do you like the way the spec is now best?

[13:44:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so far no one seems willing to write the UnChante Proposal for this issue

[13:44:04.0000] <Lachy>
I think 4 and 5 should be dropped

[13:44:05.0000] <jgraham>
othermaciej: No, I like 3

[13:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
But with slightly different names

[13:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
(I wasn't clear by "all" I meant "all the ones you listed")

[13:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: would it be ok to post a link to this page on public-html? Maybe someone there will want to champion one of those

[13:45:03.0000] <Lachy>
My order of prefence for the others is: 2 and 3, followed by 1, followed by 6.

[13:45:04.0000] <Lachy>
sure, it's a public wiki. Go ahread.

[13:45:05.0000] <Lachy>
*ahead

[13:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, what's the "UnChante Proposal"?

[13:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I meant to say UnChange

[13:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh

[13:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
i.e. in favor of the status quo

[13:47:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, the status quo can't really be defended

[13:47:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I wanna write UnChange for <details>.  Leaving it as <dt>/<dd> is still my personal favorite.

[13:47:05.0000] <Dashiva>
So now HTML Microdata vs HTML5 Microdata is also a matter of picking winners... joy

[13:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just because I'll virtually always be styling both the label and the content, and it's the only one with a pair of elements.

[13:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
in that case, we should split proposal 3 into two. One for figure and one for details

[13:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
proposal 3 could have a variant with elements for both the body and contents

[13:48:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd be happy with that.

[13:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
how would you style the body and exclude the label under proposal 3?

[13:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<figbody> and <dbody>!

[13:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure figbody/fbody is as useful as dbody

[13:49:03.0000] <jgraham>
I was about to say <dhead> and <dbody>. I thought Lachy would like that :)

[13:49:04.0000] <Lachy>
or, maybe it's not necessary to split 3, if the poll clearly separates the questions for figure and details. (just make it clear that a vote for proposal 3 for one of them doesn't imply a vote for the other too

[13:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You kidding?  I'll often be wanting some padding on my figbody, but not on my figcaption.

[13:50:01.0000] <daedb>
I don't want a <figbody>, it's unnecessary wrapping.

[13:50:02.0000] <othermaciej>
you could have a rule for details > :not(dlabel) { .. }

[13:50:03.0000] <othermaciej>
agreed that is a bit mysterious

[13:50:04.0000] <Lachy>
if you want to style the content, then we don't need a specialised element. Use <div>, possibly with a class

[13:50:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Doesn't work with padding, unless you are very careful with your selectors and break up the padding rule.

[13:50:06.0000] <daedb>
If I want an extra styling hook I'll just throw in a <div> or something.

[13:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bah.  I just feel bad putting in extra divs.

[13:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I am hoping that with some discussion, we might be able to get down to a clear crowd favorite and settle this without a poll

[13:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
there's no semantic we really need to convey with it

[13:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: oh, I see, you want to style the body as a unit

[13:51:04.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, btw, I still object to dt/dd for details for the compatibility hacks required for it

[13:51:05.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: you *could* always add a div with a unique class

[13:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: since the element is only needed as a styling hook, and not for semantics or the UA's use

[13:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then again, if I go suggest in a while the idea Hixie and I were discussing, I could just write ::wrap(dlabel+*), and get a pseudoelement wrapping everything below the dlabel.

[13:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, that's a nice idea

[13:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
would it wrap all groups of consecutive elements that match the selector?

[13:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(The idea is that you could specify one or two selectors, detailing the first and after-the-last element.)

[13:53:02.0000] <daedb>
::wrap(dlabel~*)?

[13:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, frex, to get a section pseudo (when using implicit sectioning), ::wrap(h1,h1) would do it.  Similarly ::wrap(h2,:matches(h1,h2)) for the lower ones.  Though that should probably be a built-in pseudo anyway.

[13:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, that wouldn't quite work if you described it properly, since the second h1 would be wrapped by the pseudo-section, where as you likely want the wrap to stop before it

[13:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, the second selector picks the after-the-end element.

[13:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
also, you'd end up with weird overlapping wraps

[13:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
So it would, indeed, stop just before the next h1.

[13:56:04.0000] <Lachy>
oh. I misunderstand what you meant by after-the-end

[13:56:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Np.  I'll be more precise when I actually suggest it.

[13:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
I though you meant the wrap would begin at the start element and then continue until the end element, inclusive

[13:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's what I thought at first, but it's overly hard to specify the end properly in a lot of common cases.

[13:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
While with this, you can either specify after-the-end, or if you have an easy way to refer to the last element that should be in the group, just give "elem + *" as the second selector.

[13:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And, obviously, specifying only one selector like I did for the dlabel bit means that it should envelop all following siblings of the selected element.

[14:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There's just some oddities with being able to specify overlapping ::wrap()s that I need to resolve, probably in whatever way we decide to resolve overlapping ::text()s.

[14:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I added Proposal 7

[14:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(variant of 3 that adds special elements for the body parts)

[14:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I changed it to specify optional on both of them.

[14:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: works4me

[14:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
haha, I just noticed that in the current WebApps WG charter, selectors api is scheduled to reach rec in the year 20089. http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/charter/#deliverables

[14:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: after all, <tbody> is optional

[14:05:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haha.

[14:05:04.0000] <Lachy>
somehow, I don't think the internet will still be around in 18,000 yeras

[14:05:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: you slacker!

[14:05:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Exactly.

[14:05:07.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: Oh ye of little faith

[14:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i believe at the time the 2d split was first suggested, i didn't have anything like my current spec gen infrastructure

[14:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
it is in fact relatively easy for me to carve specific chapters out now

[14:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
(though it is harder than ever to make invasive splits)

[14:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that is good

[14:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I reopened http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7386 , see what you think of my reasoning

[14:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
If a new editor was found for one of the split-out sections, how would that work with the current spec gen infrastructure?

[14:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Would it be necessary for them to extract it into a separate source document, or would they edit the same source document in SVN, or something?

[14:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
we'd just do what we did with xhr

[14:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, with the 2d context split, it seems this requirement is no longer present in either W3C HTML5 or the 2D context specs: 'This specification only defines one context, with the name "2d". If getContext() is called with that exact string for its contextId argument, then the UA must return a reference to an object implementing CanvasRenderingContext2D.'

[14:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's still there, just in different words

[14:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[14:53:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I see. It's repeated here "When the getContext()  method of a canvas element is invoked with 2d as the argument, a CanvasRenderingContext2D object is returned."

[14:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
making that first one redundant, since the latter is present in all copies

[14:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
it would be less confusing if the differences between the split specs and the full specs were kept to a minimum

[14:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
the latter isn't a conformance requirement

[14:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
and yes, the changes are kept to a minimum

[14:55:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, then I can't see where the equivalent conformance requirement is

[14:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
but the latter does come from the Conformance Requirements section

[14:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
paragraphs 2 and 3 of http://dev.w3.org/html5/2dcontext/Overview.html#conformance-requirements

[14:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
that's what I quoted

[14:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
no

[14:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
you quoted the whatwg version

[14:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
which says "is"

[14:56:06.0000] <Hixie>
the w3c version says "must be"

[14:56:07.0000] <Hixie>
like i said, i'm keeping the changes to a minimum :-)

[14:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah. I didn't notice the difference in the 2 sentences

[14:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
then I take that back. Please keep the differences to a maximum to avoid further confusions like that caused by such subtle differences :-)

[14:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[15:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, your selector would tend to misnest.  I don't see any way you could sensibly define things like padding in general if you have <table><th><h1>...</h1>...</table><p>...<h1>...</h1> and you try to wrap everything between the h1's.

[15:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, foo + * won't work if foo is the last child of its parent.

[15:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm confused by your first statement, Aryeh.

[15:09:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
And yes it will - at most, it will wrap to the end of its parent.

[15:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, wait, now I see what you mean.

[15:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, take my HTML snippet.  What does ::wrap(h1, h1) { padding: 1em } do?  What box gets the padding?  Your ::wrap includes some children of one block, then a sibling of that block.

[15:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, it explicitly doesn't jump between generation boundaries.  (I didn't state that before, but it's part of the proposal in my head.)

[15:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So in this case it would do nothing.

[15:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because we have <th><h1>...</h1></th>.

[15:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would just select the h1.

[15:11:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes, it would wrap the <h1> only there.

[15:11:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
And foo + * just won't match anything if foo has no next sibling, as a normal selector.

[15:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I assume ::wrap(squozzle, fooble) wraps nothing if there's no fooble element in the document.

[15:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But if you had <h1>foo</h1><table><th><h1>bar</h1></table><h1>baz</h1>, it would generate two wrapping pseudos at the top level, and one inside the th

[15:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That sounds unexpected.

[15:12:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
The foo+* where foo has no next sibling works as expected - if the second selector is missing or matches nothing, it just wraps to the end of the first selector's parent box.

[15:12:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me has thought about this problem a bit for MediaWiki, from the perspective of auto-adding divs around sections, but it's pretty hairy if there's any nesting

[15:12:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, I see.

[15:12:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
And yes, ::wrap(sqozzle, fooble) wouldn't do anything.

[15:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The first selector has to match something for it to work at all.

[15:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait, wouldn't ::wrap(squozzle, fooble) wrap around each squozzle element and all its subsequent siblings, if there's no fooble element?

[15:13:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[15:13:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think I get it now, then.

[15:13:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[15:13:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It will break horribly if you have any kind of nesting, but oh well.

[15:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It won't break.  It just won't generate pseudos like you expect.

[15:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The main problem is this:  <b>foo</b> <i>bar</i> <b>baz</b> <i>qux</i>, ::wrap(b,b) {} ::wrap(i,i) {}

[15:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That'll attempt to create overlapping wrapping pseudos, which is no good.

[15:15:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's a much bigger problem, yes.

[15:15:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I believe that we can resolve this with whatever we decide is appropriate for the same situation in the ::text() pseudo.

[15:15:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I got the impression ::text() wasn't going anywhere.

[15:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, I'll be revisiting it in a bit.  I'm pretty attached to the functionality.

[15:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And the two authors of the group (me and Brad) both feel very strongly about it, so as long as we can get the implementors to grudgingly accept it, we should be golden.

[15:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That just involves resolving all the ambiguities, and ensuring that it's not too expensive to match.

[15:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
"just"

[15:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think the point that it ties together style and content too tightly is pretty compelling.

[15:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think the argument that simple page transformations are unreasonably useful is pretty compelling.  ^_^

[15:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
::text does indeed tie to content pretty tightly, but the current solution, where you wrap the content in <span>s according to the styling you want, is just as bad, it's just putting the problem in the HTML rather than the CSS.

[15:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
::wrap wouldn't be as tightly tied, since at least it just selects on the same things as normal CSS.

[15:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The fact is, there simply isn't a generic declarative solution for complex prettifying of arbitrary content short of AI, and I think we're still pretty far from "page-style: make-it-pretty;".

[15:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So style is fated to intertwine with content at least somewhat in some situations, just as behavior twines with content and style in js.

[15:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh, page-visual-template: url(foo.pdf);

[15:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, what's this page-visual-template property?

[15:28:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
A pretend property implemented by AI, which takes a pdf and styles the page accordingly.

[15:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh.

[15:29:00.0000] <cardona507>
interesting

[15:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think what you're looking for is: html { content: url(design.png); }

[15:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, that's clearly not good for user interaction.

[15:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
fine then. binding: url(layout.xbl);

[15:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But then I can't just hand it a file created by Advertising!

[15:31:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Those people definitely won't know how to create xbl.

[15:31:03.0000] <Lachy>
oh, you poor lazy web developer ;-P

[15:31:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nope, I need an AI which will look at the page, match it with my content, and automagically do everything for me.

[15:32:00.0000] <cardona507>
heh

[15:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But it needs to be a secret so I can still charge for 8 hours of work.

[15:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's always the tricky part.

[15:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
On the other hand, if we have AI like that, maybe we can all retire and have robots do everything for us.

[15:36:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sounds good to me.

[15:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is waiting for scarcity economics to die.

[15:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, what's scarcity economics?

[15:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Economics founded on scarcity.  Essentially, nearly all of economics before the digital age.

[15:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anything where there is a limited quantity of product, such that you have to limit it.

[15:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
scarcity of phyical products is just reality. But, yeah, for digital, I agree, artificial scarcity is harmful

[15:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
When you have essentially infinite product (or similarly, when duplicating a product is essentially free), everyone benefits.

[15:39:02.0000] <cardona507>
free - chris anderson

[15:39:03.0000] <Lachy>
huh?

[15:39:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh.  With matter printers we'd reduce physical scarcity to whatever raw materials the printer needed.

[15:39:05.0000] <Lachy>
who is Chris Anderson?

[15:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Universal constructors!

[15:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nanorobots!

[15:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, you mean the Star Trek Replicators?

[15:40:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure, whatever mechanic ended up being used for them.

[15:40:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Basically yeah.

lachy - the editor in chief of wired - and the author of "the long tail" & "free"

[15:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
I hate watching long videos on YouTube. Is that video downloadable from elsewhere?

[15:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
actually, I'll use miro to get it from YT

[15:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I finished fleshing out proposal 3

[15:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if anyone would like to review, comments would be appreciated

[15:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess everything I wrote about equally applies to 3b

[15:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and almost all of it applies to 7

[15:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
though you would have to strike "Does Not Introduce Redundant Elements for the Content" and justify "Adds Helpful Optional Elements for the Content"

[15:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, should the content model of details say "preceded or followed by a dlabel element?" Shouldn't it be preceded only?

[15:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: let me check what the spec says now

[15:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: You have to escape all your html - there's one spot where a tag is clearly missing.

[15:51:02.0000] <Lachy>
it says one dt followed by dd

[15:51:03.0000] <Lachy>
so the label must come first

[15:51:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
second paragraph of Impact.

[15:51:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: and it requires both?

[15:51:06.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I will fix to match

[15:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
nm, I just fixed it.

[15:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes, both are required

[15:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
it wouldn't make sense to have a details without a label

[15:52:03.0000] <Lachy>
and even less sense to have no content

[15:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, unless it were just used as a placeholder in the page

[15:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
fixed

[15:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, sorry. the current spec does make dt optional

[15:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
optional but has to be first?

[15:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess I should look myself

[15:54:03.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[15:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ok really fixed

[15:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
does folks like the suggested names in 3b better? (figcaption and dsummary instead of fcaption and dlabel)

[15:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, dsummary.  Yeah, I like it.

[15:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
I keep mistyping dlabel as dlable today.

[15:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
The <details> spec text does call the caption-like thing "the summary"

[15:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"label" makes more to sense to me, offhand.

[15:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
heck, it could just be <summary> since that is presently unused

[15:57:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, that would be a slam dunk IMO.

[15:57:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sounds even better.

[15:57:06.0000] <Lachy>
though, I have been mistyping a lot today. Don't know why. maybe I'm just tired.

[15:58:00.0000] <hober>
But then you start to see <article><summary>...

[15:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
I once suggested using <summary>, but I can't remember what the objections were at the time

[15:58:02.0000] <hober>
<article><dsummary> is much more obviously wrong, in the same way as <html><tbody>

[15:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I do think label is more appropriate here, given its effectively a control label


2010-01-12
[16:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
and figcaption is better than fcaption

[16:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I can see an argument for both "label" and "summary"

[16:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I like the way <summary> quite directly suggests what it should be, for maximum accessibility.

[16:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But it's not necessarily a summary, is it?

[16:01:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though it is clickable like a <label>, <summary> just matches better in my head.

[16:01:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's pretty close.

[16:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or rather, *should* be pretty close if <details> is used correctly.

[16:02:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Note: I consider heading-like content to be close to a summary.

[16:02:02.0000] <Lachy>
I think summary sort of works as an alternative to figcaption, though its name would clash semantically with the table summary attribute, which is certainly not a caption

[16:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I don't see how summary works for details

[16:03:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Lachy: Check http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/interactive-elements.html#the-details-element

[16:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Note how the prose uses the term "summary" to describe the toggler bit.

[16:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I saw that. I'm not sure that's a good description for it

[16:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/mid/1263225612.26294.2.camel@chacal is interesting

[16:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in the spec example pictures (from the Mac OS X Finder), it's probably more accurate to call the short bits a "label" rather than a "summary"

[16:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: what is interesting about it?

[16:05:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think what Philippe is saying is:

[16:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
that the new rdfa group _doesn't_ include the text/html rdfa stuff

[16:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
ah

[16:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, what are those controls called in OS X?

[16:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I was expecting that "RDFa in HTML" would stay an HTML WG deliverable

[16:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: disclosure widgets is what i've heard them called

[16:06:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Interesting, doesn't that make some of the statements about the pointed-out lacks in RDFa being addressed in 1.1 moot?

[16:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the term for the triangle part is "disclosure triangle"

[16:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, yeah, I remember reading "disclosure triangles" in the Apple HIG

[16:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
looking up what the control itself is called officially

[16:07:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or does it just mean the group responsible for it is different, but they'll still describe integration with HTML as well as XML?

[16:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, did you make those Pillar magazine graphics?

[16:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[16:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's my cat

[16:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I know

[16:09:01.0000] <Lachy>
I recognised it

[16:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, RDFa in HTML never did anything but said how to integrate it, right?  I assume it will just say how to integrate 1.1 just as much.

[16:09:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: "disclosure triangle" is the only term, the control is provided as just the spinny triangle, and not as the whole integrated thing that incorporates the contents

[16:09:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Well, at the very least it'll have to be updated for the various incompatible changes that 1.1 is making.

[16:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't see how that's relevant to the statements you referred to, though.

[16:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It is probably me just misreading the statement, so don't worry about it.

[16:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh man, I've been off work for 15 minutes!  Woo!

[16:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me goes to play more Saints Row.

[17:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I keep accidentally opening http://damowmow.com/playground/htmlwg/chart.html in released Safari instead of trunk

[17:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I gotta get that bug into a software update for my own sanity

[17:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[18:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: is it useful to have separate "HTML5 spec bugs" and "HTML5 spec proposals" components in w3c bugzilla?

[18:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm thinking of suggesting they be folded into one

[18:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
no, but please don't change that because that would break all my queries

[18:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
all my queries, bookmarks, scripts, etc, use those two components

[18:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I see

[18:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
(similarly, please don't add new components)

[18:06:04.0000] <othermaciej>
is it possible to make, say, the "proposals" one closed to new bugs without removing it fully?

[18:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
dunno

[18:06:06.0000] <Hixie>
is it causing a problem?

[18:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
not really, just minor annoyance when forming a query by hand

[18:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[18:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I do think separate drafts should have separate components, cause otherwise it's pretty hard to separately track when each gets to 0 bugs in a non-terminal state

[18:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
well if there are other editors, they should get components, sure, but for drafts i edit i treat them all as one draft anyway

[18:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it's moot

[18:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so I'm seeing 231 bugs resolved since the start of the month

[18:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
67 still open

[18:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
incoming rate must be out of control

[18:09:03.0000] <othermaciej>
since there were fewer than 200 open on the 1st

[18:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
incoming rate grew significantly higher than i expected, yes

[18:09:05.0000] <Hixie>
though i don't track that

[18:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
so i don't have numbers

[18:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
115 created since the start of the month

[18:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Jeez, that's 10 a day.

[18:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
FWIW Hixie's accept/reject rate is still around 50% of the non-garbage bugs

[18:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(where by "garbage" I mean duplicate or invalid)

[18:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I looked at some past months and the rate seems to be slowly going down over time

[18:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the highest I found was 70%

[18:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
as in i'm rejecting more?

[18:14:04.0000] <othermaciej>
that seems like pretty much whatI would expect for a maturing spec

[18:14:05.0000] <othermaciej>
yes, you seem to be rejecting more percentage-wise than in, say, July

[18:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd expect the rate to go the other way, actually, because the problems should be getting more trivial (e.g. reviewers should be moving from "this doesn't work" to "this is misspelt")

[18:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well some reviewers are still submitting requests for new features

[18:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
there might be a better correlation of rate vs reporter than rate vs time

[18:16:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but you're right, I could imagine it going the other way if the proportion of editorial issues was increasing as one might expect

[18:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
possible - I did not try to measure that cause it would be too much work :-)

[19:11:00.0000] <cardona507>
since we are moving into a fluid versionless HTML - will we also move into a versionless web applications?

[23:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Is the Director going to appoint three so far unannounced individuals to the TAG in addition to the re-elected and the continuing participants

[23:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me tries to understand http://www.w3.org/News/2010#entry-8694

[23:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: that's what it sounds like

[23:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: you should run for TAG next time

[23:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'd tell my AC rep to vote for you :-)

[23:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and it would make their minutes fun to read I bet

[00:27:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/html5/ gives me 500

[00:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
try now

[00:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me never remembers how Windows "NT" version numbers map to branding names

[00:31:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: oh, it's removed?

[00:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
read your whatwg mail :-)

[00:32:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
not today

[00:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-January/024708.html

[00:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. still 3 columns at http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_various_versions_of_the_spec.3F

[00:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
If this trend continues, I guess I'll have to migrate html5.validator.nu to validator.nu and migrate validator.nu to custom.validator.nu

[00:35:02.0000] <hsivonen>
or something

[00:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
calling the primary UI "html5" was probably a bad idea in the first place

[00:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[00:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
of course, "html5" wasn't the primary UI when the "html5" UI was minted

[00:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
changing the meaning of the validator.nu UI sucks for the APIs and for bookmarks...

[00:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and decoupling the API endpoints from the UI URLs would suck, too

[00:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
well, I think I'm going to wait and see how things develop

[00:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
although by HTML6, I need to rearrange the UI anyway

[00:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
what is this "html6" you speak of? :-P

[00:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, HTML5.next

[00:41:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
HTML5 is HTML5.next

[01:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: have you run into cvs locking problem with the last few checkins?

[01:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
no

[01:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ok

[01:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: revision number no longer shows up correctly in the line above the copyright

[01:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think because you have to change it to $Revision: $

[01:16:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
with a colon

[01:16:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
maybe

[01:16:03.0000] <Hixie>
oops

[01:16:04.0000] <Hixie>
will fix

[01:48:00.0000] <roc>
is it true that the lists.w3.org archives aren't indexed by Google?

[01:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=site:lists.w3.org

[01:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
Results 1 - 10 of about 1,080,000 from lists.w3.org

[01:50:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
how come i have about 1,520,000

[01:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's an approximation

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
probably based on how many servers responded, and you probably hit a different data center than i do

[01:51:02.0000] <jgraham>
Quite a bad one it seems :)

[01:51:03.0000] <roc>
hmm

[01:51:04.0000] <roc>
how come my searches never find anything

[01:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i actually have no idea what it's based on)

[01:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
I get 1,090,000.

[01:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: what are you looking or?

[01:52:03.0000] <jgraham>
It should just say results 1-10 of about 1E6

[01:52:04.0000] <roc>
e.g.

[01:52:05.0000] <roc>
www-style making pt a physical unit

[01:52:06.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan__, also, google.se returns different resutls from google.com

[01:52:07.0000] <roc>
that query doesn't even bring up lists.w3.org in the top-10

[01:52:08.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=site:lists.w3.org+www-style+making+pt+a+physical+unit&aq=f&oq=&aqi=

[01:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess lists.w3.org just doesn't seem very useful to google's algorithms

[01:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
hard to argue with that position :-P

[01:53:02.0000] <roc>
also

[01:53:03.0000] <roc>
"www-style archive" brings up lists.w3.org as the top hit

[01:54:00.0000] <roc>
but just http://lists.w3.org, not, say, "www-style⊙wo Mail Archives" (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/)

[01:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[01:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can if you search for that a lot, click "add a result" at the bottom, and enter that URL for that query

[01:55:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
http://www.bing.com/search?q=www-style+making+pt+a+physical+unit&go=&form=QBLH&filt=all

[01:56:00.0000] <doublec>
search for 'w3c dysfunctional'

[01:56:01.0000] <doublec>
that brings up lists.w3c.org right away

[01:56:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
clearly bing is better than google

[01:56:03.0000] <doublec>
lists.w3.org that is - public-html

[01:56:04.0000] <hsivonen>
I tried to use Bing as my default engine for a couple of hours and then went back to Google due to search quality issues

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
though it could be that only Bing's Finland region sucks

[01:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Bing seems to insist on making the search results locale-sensitive--badly

[01:58:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
there should be an <input type=range> for locale-senitiveness

[01:59:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
when i search for an article about some topic, i don't care about locale at all

[01:59:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
but when i search for a restaurant, i do

[02:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
GPS-assisted restaurant search on Google Maps Mobile is awesome

[02:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(when outside Helsinki, that is. for Helsinki, there's a specialized service that beats Google on restaurants)

[02:00:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
maybe search engines could figure out from the query whether to be locale-sensitive or not

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I believe they try with varying levels of success

[02:07:00.0000] <roc>
hmm

[02:07:01.0000] <roc>
Bing IS better than Google

[02:07:02.0000] <roc>
I should pay more attention to Asa

I think Google tries to be locale-sensitive with great success

[02:09:00.0000] <roc>
my search for "empress garden" returns the correct Auckland restaurant as the top hit (actually the top several hits) ... I haven't searched for it before

roc: I tried to pay attention to Asa's recommendation, but the results were bad for me.

[02:10:01.0000] <roc>
I was being sarcastic

[02:11:00.0000] <roc>
I don't have an "add a result" option on Google

[02:12:00.0000] <roc>
/me sends feedback

aargh. are data: URLs that don't have <script> elements synchronously navigated to in WebKit?

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: are you logged into google?

Hixie: are you actively following the about:blank discussion in dev.platform?

[02:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: not actively

[02:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so far it seems that about:blank navigation isn't fully synchronous in Gecko and WebKit

[02:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but might be in Opera and IE8

text/sandboxed-html doesn't have the same backcompat as <iframe sandbox>

[03:51:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
it should be a parameter for text/html instead

[03:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan__: Wouldn't that defeat the point?

[03:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
If a user could visit the supposedly-sandboxed content by a direct URL, rather than via the iframe, and their (legacy) browser rendered the page, the user would be vulnerable to malicious content

[03:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, but I suppose legacy browsers will ignore the sandbox attribute on iframe anyway, so maybe we don't care about them

[03:57:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
or we should have <sandboxediframe>

[04:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: did you have a page with links to Web content that doesn't declare the charset in any way?

[04:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Hmm, I can't find any like that

[04:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ok

[04:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
There's http://philip.html5.org/data/charsets.html#sniffed-not-meta but it sounds like that wasn't looking at HTTP content-type

[04:07:00.0000] <Philip`>

does the whatwg wiki require keys?

[04:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think he realised it was the whatwg wiki, as opposed to the W3C wiki, which does have restrictions on who can edit it

[05:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or is it put together from lower level pieces on ActionScript?

[05:35:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
Huvet: it's worse when people change various parts of the doctype, like <!DOCTYPE php PUBLIC "-//W3C/DTD HTML 4.01//NL" />

[05:36:01.0000] <Huvet>
I wouldn't be surprised if someone used backslashes in the doctype, cause "they are on windows"

[05:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. I've never seen !DOCTYPE php

[05:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's a cool effect, hsivonen

[05:38:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
can't that be done with 2d canvas?

[05:39:00.0000] <Philip`>

[05:39:01.0000] <Dashiva>

[05:39:02.0000] <Philip`>

The sphere mapped to a rectangle?

[05:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan__: in theory, yes, but is the perf sufficient?

[05:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
There's a lot of http://philip.html5.org/data/doctypes.html#%3c%21doctype_doctype_public_%22-%2f%2fw3c%2f%2fdtd_html_4.0_transitional%2f%2fen%22%3e

[05:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How would you do a sphere -> rect (or opposite) mapping in 2D canvas?

[05:41:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
hsivonen: no idea

[05:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: by pixel, I guess

[05:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: or by slicing the image and drawing approximation with a 2D matrix

[05:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
I expect it'd be really hard to make it look good in 2D canvas, because you can only do affine transforms, so you can't even do a decent textured polygon mesh

[05:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the above Flash thingy doesn't look so great when there are straight lines in the view

[05:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
like the railing of the bridge

[05:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
That demo already seems to have really dodgy perspective

[05:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
since the image seems to stretch when it's near the edges

[05:47:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
3d effects don't have to be perfect

[05:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think you can draw an arbitrary texture triangle onto an arbitrary screen triangle (by computing an appropriate transform matrix), so I suppose you could pre-compute a spherical triangle mesh that covers the screen, and map each triangle onto texture coordinates depending on view angle, so maybe it wouldn't be too bad

[05:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
but you'd have to use lots of triangles

[07:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
zcorpan__, I don't see one in mozilla-central.

[07:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just in the context menu.

[07:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know why not, I imagine people would expect it from YouTube (I would).

[07:03:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(except that I specifically know the feature exists so am willing to explore and do things like right-click)

[07:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
AryehGregor: does the MediaWiki API provide any way to extract sections from a page?

[07:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
MikeSmith, um, let me see.

[07:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK, to be clear, what I mean is, if I give it a section title, can I get the contents of that section back

[07:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd imagine you could do it by section number.  Section title is probably less reliable, those aren't guaranteed to be unique and section 0 has no title.

[07:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doesn't usually use the API, so is looking at the docs

[07:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.  The closest I see is this: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=parse&page=HTML5&prop=sections

[07:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
text/sandboxed-html doesn't seem to have very nice graceful degradation.

[07:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess you could retrieve that, retrieve the wikitext, and slice out the bytes given.  If you want it to be HTML, you can then feed that back to the parser.  Of course, that will give weird results if any tags straddle sections.

[07:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The person to ask in RoanKattouw, he's the API guy, but he seems not to be on IRC right now.

[07:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
I assume that's probably considered a feature that current UAs won't accidentally interpret the HTML, but Firefox popping up a save dialog to users isn't very nice.

[07:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
Safari seems to have the best fallback, which is to treat it as text/plain

[07:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
If your site wants to work in legacy browsers without exposing those users to XSS attacks, the site will have to sanitise the HTML anyway before it can be used in <iframe sandbox>

[07:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
in which case serving the same content as standalone text/html to legacy browsers wouldn't introduce any new dangers

[07:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
It only makes a difference for sandbox-supporting browsers, where the sandbox layer of defence would be lost if the content was accessed outside of its iframe

[07:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I realise that. I'm just concerned that this will limit adoption among sites, since they usually need to maintain compat with older browsers for a few years after they've been made obsolete

[07:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
So I guess something like text/html;sandbox=1 would be better because it will work in legacy browsers without introducing new vulnerabilities, and will allow sandbox-supporting browsers to apply extra defences to it

[07:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
and I don't know any site that would want users to inadvertently save the file and then possibly open it wondering what it is

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
(But, on the other hand, people will add ;sandbox=1 to all their pages before anyone's released a sandbox-supporting browser, and therefore prevent it ever being supported)

[07:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
Perhaps sites will resort to some sort of browser sniffing to determine whether or not text/sandboxed-html is supported

[07:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, does nine count as "a few"?

[07:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, in the case of IE6, yes, but luckily, upgrade rates do seem to getting better than that these days

[07:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Thankfully.

[07:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is hoping enterprises will switch to Win7 with IE6-in-VM for their intranets

[07:35:02.0000] <Lachy>
anyone know what the usage of Firefox 2 is like these days, now that it's had 3.0 and 3.5 after it?

[07:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me looks it up...

[07:36:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportClients.htm

[07:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2 says 0.9%

[07:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So Firefox 2.0 is still 5% or so of Firefox market share, while IE6 is still 20% or so of IE market share.

[07:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: Looks like it got confused by Opera 10's UA string

[07:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, it's a confusing UA string, isn't it.

[07:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
All UA strings are confusing

[07:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's not too bad. It's only been ~1.5 years since Firefox 3.0 succeeded it, and it's already at fairly ignorable levels

[07:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've been ignoring it for a long time.

[07:42:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though I've also been ignoring IE6 as much as possible for at least 6 months.

[07:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, me too. When I was doing web development, I started ignoring older firefox releases fairly soon after the new one was released.

[07:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have the benefit of our tech support pushing people onto IE7 and now IE8.  We don't get very many IE6 hits now.

[07:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
which site is that for?

[07:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
igofigure.com

[07:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
why isn't your tech support pushing people onto Firefox, Opera or Safari?

[07:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
or Chrome?

[07:45:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because it's much easier to say "Do Windows Update, our software requires it".

[07:45:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how long it takes for an obsolete Firefox release to fall below the combined market share of all versions of Opera

[07:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And updated IE is a Windows Update.

[08:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
foolip, so Opera is going to support H.264 if the codec is installed on the system?

[08:23:00.0000] <foolip>
AryehGregor: unless we take steps to prevent it, it will happen to work on Unix, but no other platforms

[08:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
foolip, Unix including OS X or not?

[08:24:01.0000] <foolip>
no, not Mac

[08:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting.

[08:24:03.0000] <foolip>
just platforms where we can use the native GStreamer, which is, basically, Linux and FreeBSD

[08:24:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wishes Apple would end the discussion by supporting Theora already.  :(

[08:25:00.0000] <foolip>
/me too

[08:25:01.0000] <foolip>
/me also hope noone goes off claiming that "Opera supports H.264" because GStreamer may happen to

[08:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders how many Linuxes include H.264 support

[08:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, probably all of them if you click through a "don't click this if you live in the US" button.

[08:27:01.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: none do by default

[08:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I can't say "all of them".

[08:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But I'm pretty sure the major ones have it somewhere in the repos.

[08:27:04.0000] <Philip`>
I'd assume it's just the ones that are willing to pay licensing fees and the ones that don't care about patent infringement, but I don't know if there's any that aren't either of those categories

[08:27:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
*Is* it patent infringement in Europe?

[08:27:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or just the US?

[08:27:07.0000] <foolip>
well, Ubuntu will happily install lots of stuff if you play something in totem

[08:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, it looks like I do have GStreamer installed

[08:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
but I don't think I ever use anything that uses it

[08:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
(since I just use mplayer and vlc)

[08:49:00.0000] <foolip>
ubuntu has it per default anyway

Hooray for Mercurial

[08:58:01.0000] <jcranmer>

Hmm, that's not as good an insult

Philip`, you're a subversive, mercurial git who . . . hangs out in bazaars.

[09:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Could use work.

[09:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
You're such a CVS

[09:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What a load of VCS

[09:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I know.  You're a subversive, mercurial git whose version-control preferences are simply bazaar.

[09:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(could still use work, but getting there)

[09:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
git who VC(t)S bazaars

Hixie: I think since it is an important component of making an existing feature (sandboxed iframes) viable, I would suggest it should go in the W3C copy

[17:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[17:34:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it does not strike me as the kind of thing likely to cause huge controversy but you could send notice and an explanation to the list if you think it would help

[17:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
"the list" being public-html

[17:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[18:07:00.0000] <tantek>
ICYMI: blog post re: HTML5 from web designer Andy Clarke: http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/keep_calm_and_carry_on_with_html5

[18:08:00.0000] <tantek>
(n.b. I left a comment with my personal opinion/experience)

[18:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hi tantek

[18:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I like that the post title starts with "Keep calm"

[18:11:01.0000] <tantek>
hi othermaciej - indeed

[18:11:02.0000] <tantek>
would love to stay and chat but gotta run to tonight's microformats dinner

[18:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
later

[18:11:04.0000] <tantek>
will try to be back on in a few hours later tonight

[18:15:00.0000] <jwalden>
DON'T PANIC

[18:24:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me 'hmm's at the conspicuous absence of Mozilla from the combatants list in that post

[18:24:01.0000] <jwalden>
and I suppose, to a much lesser degree, maybe Google

[18:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: are you around?

[18:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yo

[18:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: I'm thinking we should assemble some of the options from http://wiki.whatwg.org/index.php?title=Change_Proposal:_figure_and_details and submit them soon

[18:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: I'm gonna glue together the pieces for 3 in the w3c wiki but I would be happy if in terms of submitting on the mailing list you did 6 first

[18:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Did 6 on the list, or did 6 on the w3c wiki?

[18:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I can also do 7 if you want, or you can feel free to steal my content from 3 and submit it on yourself

[18:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: I am expressing myself poorly and having a hard time rephrasing

[18:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
let me try again

[18:42:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hehe.

[18:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
- For actual submission to the mailing list, I'd prefer if you sent in 6 before I send in 3.

[18:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(I guess we should also ask Lachy if he wants to be listed as co-author)

[18:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
- For assembling only the relevant pieces in the right order, I'm going to do that now, in the w3c wiki, so I can just mail a link to that when ready

[18:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
assuming the status quo and <legend> are non-options, from that list 2, 3, and 3b seem the best

[18:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am going to include the names from 3b as alternatives in my 3 write-up

[18:44:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I think I like 3b the best too.

[18:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd be willing to drop 6, since nobody else is really cheerleading it.

[18:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I could not decide which names are better (both sets seem good to me)

[18:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: I think it's good to have more alternatives on the table... maybe worth submitting since you did the writing and consider dropping later if no one likes it best

[18:45:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh, kk.

[18:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: if it would save time, if the chairs can confirm that neither <dt>/<dd> nor <legend> are considered acceptable, i'd be happy to just do 3 or 3b

[18:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
or some hybrid thereof

[18:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
not sure which i prefer of <dlabel> and <dsummary> or if some other word would be better

[18:46:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well, if no one writes a proposal defending them by the 16th, then neither will be acceptable

[18:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I would rather not prejudge without seeing what arguments are mustered in their favor, if any

[18:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: but if you're willing to go along with one of the options presented then I do think that would save time 

[18:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, want me to write up 6 tonight?  I can do it while I'm letting the chinchillas out.

[18:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Then I can write up 7 as a diff of 3 after you do it.

[18:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you can do 6 that would be sweet

[18:50:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am now assembling 3 at http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/ChangeProposals/DdDtFcaptionDlabel

[18:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: well, i can live with figcaption given that nobody seems to agree with me that we should use <legend>, and basically nobody at all seems to want <dt>/<dd>. I'm not a huge fan of <dlabel> and <dsummary>, but failing anything better I could live with one of those too.

[18:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
k, watching Chopped right now, will have by midnight my time (3 hours from now)

[18:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe <summary>, though that would make the <table summary=""> people upset. (It would only be a problem if we kept summary="", which I don't think we should, but tying this to the summary="" issue seems like it would make the process complicated.)

[18:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I'll probably list additional options (fcaption/figcaption/figurecaption and dlabel/detailslabel/dsummary/detailssummary/summary)

[18:55:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh god, detailssummary is the worst possible name.  Don't even suggest it.

[18:55:03.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: good point

[18:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
same with figurecaption :-)

[18:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
and detailslabel

[18:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
lslslslsl

[18:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
all right

[18:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-P

[18:56:04.0000] <othermaciej>
fcaption/figcaption and dlabel/dsummary/summary as the options

[18:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and I may tweak which are presented as the default choice and/or leave picking one to a straw poll or editor's discretion

[18:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm not sure what connection <summary> could possibly have to <table summary>, except the incidental name collision.  There's nothing joining the two concepts at all, though.

[18:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
the name collision primarily

[18:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
also some people want a <summary> element for <caption>

[18:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Leif has also occasionally suggested a <summary> element as an extra way to give table accessibility descriptions

[18:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
though imho calling a table description a summary is misleading, but that's another story

[18:58:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't see a problem, theoretically, with <caption> picking up a <summary> as well.  It's not like it would be ambiguous.

[18:58:05.0000] <Hixie>
people didn't like that argument with <dt>/<dd>

[18:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
True.

[18:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Eh.

[19:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
<* caption> is pretty funky

[19:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me fears he set a bad precedent with <time pubdate>

[19:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh, that is indeed the precedent I was leaning on.

[19:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/ChangeProposals/DdDtFcaptionDlabel is done

[19:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
by the way, whatever flavor of wiki that is, I like it a lot less than whatever flavor the whatwg wiki is

[19:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
whatwg is mediawiki, same as wikipedia

[19:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
esw is moinmoin

[19:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I like the MediaWiki syntax, styling, and set of easily accessible capabilities much better than MoinMoin

[19:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
apparently

[19:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
231 bugs resolved so far this month, 77 still open

[19:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the influx is kinda crazy this month

[20:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/ChangeProposals/DdDtCaptionAttribute

[20:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: neat

[20:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Doing 7 right now

[20:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: you probably also want to copy over the general rationale against dt/dd

[20:38:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
The hugormous section you have in yours?

[20:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the one that I copied from Lachlan's page

[20:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(I assumed the point of his page was to share at least that part of the rationale)

[20:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: just updated http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/ChangeProposals/DdDtFcaptionDlabel to have the alternate names included (figcaption, dsummary, etc)

[20:47:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk.

[20:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm doing 7 just as a diff on that one, so no problems here.

[20:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: if you wanted to copy it wholesale for 7, I believe all you need to change is the Details section (two more new elements, plus change the content models of <figure> and <details> appropriately), and reverse the argument in "Does Not Introduce Redundant Elements for the Content"

[20:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
to something like "Introduces Convenient Optional Elements for the Content

[20:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yup, pretty much exactly what I'm doing.

[20:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm.  Multiple <fbody>s in a <figure> - should they all be the figure content?  Like how you can have multiple <tbody>s?

[20:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it should only be valid to have one - no thought on what should happen if you specify multiple

[21:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/ChangeProposals/DdDtFbodyDbody, and I'm off to bed.

[21:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: right on

[21:19:00.0000] <erlehmann>
othermaciej, TabAtkins, i made a wordpress plugin that uses the figure / dd / dt construct: http://blog.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/html5-cc-plugin-fur-wordpress-version-0-6

[21:19:01.0000] <erlehmann>
what would you suggest to use until that issue is cleared ? nested divs ?

[21:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
erlehmann: if we're lucky we can have this one settled within a week or two

[21:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
erlehmann: don't know what I would suggest in the meantime

[21:44:00.0000] <erlehmann>
wish me luck then

[22:01:00.0000] <erlehmann>
othermaciej, i hope that will go over the mailing list again ? i normally don't read #whatwg logs.

[22:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
erlehmann: hope what will go over the mailing list?

[22:02:00.0000] <erlehmann>
the discussion about changing figure.

[22:02:01.0000] <erlehmann>
there wasn't anything in the last 2 weeks concerning that if i am right ?

[22:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there will definitely be mention on public-html

[22:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess it would be good to also mention it on the whatwg list

[22:04:00.0000] <erlehmann>
oh, i don't read public-html. whatever, ping me in chat if it changes or something. thanks for the info btw :)

[22:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej, i'm guessing you posted that to the wrong list

[22:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: oops, yeah, bad habit

[22:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
can't believe I didn't even notice

[22:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: whatever is causing that bug, though, it's really annoying!

[22:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i get weird hangs in safari quite a lot of i leave html5 open for a lot

[22:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
s/lot/long time/

[22:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
haven't filed a bug because i can't reliably reproduce it and the profiles i got from activity monitor are months old now

[22:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
and i haven't seen it for a while

[22:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
but that's mostly because i've been using chrome more recently

[22:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
gonna have to switch to firefox for a while in a few months, to keep all the browsers with equal time on my machine :-P

[22:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I'm pretty sure it's not the same thing unless you started serving Flash ads on the html5 spec

[22:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
indeed, different issue

[22:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have also never seen it, though opening multiple copies of the spec can make things slow for quite some time

[22:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
it might be some leopard thing (i'm still on leopard on my google laptop)

[22:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ah, my bug would be SnowLeopard-specific

[23:09:00.0000] <roc>
mmm, Flash_EnforceLocalSecurity, my favouritest symbol

[23:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I know, right?

[23:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: someone reminded me of the Flash bug that I'm likely experiencing but there's clearly also a bug in WebKit's out-of-process plugin support in that we let the browser get hung on a Flash hang

[23:33:00.0000] <jtbandes>
Oh, interesting, I frequently get hangs/crashes on that in Safari. I've never bothered to investigate.

[23:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Flash_EnforceLocalSecurity is just the only function in Flash that appears to have a symbol

[23:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so all Flash crashes or hangs appear to be in that function

[23:42:01.0000] <jtbandes>
Oh, I see

[23:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so it's kind of a joke among browser developers

[23:42:03.0000] <jtbandes>
Hehe.

[23:44:00.0000] <roc>
they should rename it to HTML5Parser or something

[23:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
lol

[23:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
at least the real HTML5 parser is less crashy than Flash

[23:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(would be pretty sad if that weren't the case)

[23:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(maybe the HTML5 parser on the 1.9.2 branch should be named Flash)

[00:02:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
"Andy, you are advocating Tag Soup. Yes, nobody will die from this. However, this practice makes it more difficult for tool vendors to process HTML which increases their costs and creates an uncompetitive environment. " - http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/keep_calm_and_carry_on_with_html5#r4080

[00:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
confusing use of quotation marks there

[00:03:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
seems vlad has not understood that tool vendors can use off-the-shelf html5 parsers to process html, which reduces teh cost and creates a competetive environment

[00:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
that seems odd

[00:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
considering that Vlad is a tool vendor

[00:04:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
indeed

[00:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and, therefore, one could expect him to be familiar with the serializer APIs

[00:05:00.0000] <tantekc>
greetings

[00:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
good evening

[00:06:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i also don't see where andy is advocating tag soup

[00:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
depends on what you mean "tag soup"

[00:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
he's clearly advocating early use of not-quite-yet-standard features

[00:07:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
unless vlad considers <a><div></div></a> to be tag soup

[00:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's valid in HTML5

[00:07:03.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe even advocating not worrying much about whether you follow required content models

[00:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
he doesn't seem to be calling for writing stuff like <i>foo <b>bar</i> baz</b>

[00:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or in general for writing things that only get parsed sorta by accident

[00:08:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
my interpretation is "use cutting-edge if it works and don't worry so much about it"

[00:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"tag soup" isn't a very enlightening term

[00:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
well, I learned something new by reading Lachy's comment on Vlad's blog

[00:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me was unaware of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia-Asia_debate

[00:10:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
hsivonen: comment where?

[00:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(relative to British Parliamentary Style)

[00:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thought that page would be about a debate on whether Australia is a part of Asia or not

[00:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan__: http://rebuildingtheweb.com/en/invitation-html5-team/#c20100107043000

[00:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that s strangely fascinating

[00:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the kind of debate that I believe is most common in america is "forensic debate" or something like that

[00:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I read "traditional style 3 vs. 3 approach" and thought "what? isn't *traditional* 4 vs. 4"

[00:17:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
ooh debate software

[00:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and then checked Wikipedia to see if Australia deviates from the British tradition

[00:17:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
never heard of that before

[00:17:03.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan__: that was interesting, too

[00:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe the W3C should adopt parliamentary rules of debate

[00:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(and/or procedure in general)

[00:21:02.0000] <othermaciej>
although I would not enjoy Prime Minister's Question Hour

[00:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i thought the kind of debate that the US usually was called "the media tries to convince the candidates that they won't be made to look foolish so that they can make money on ads"

[00:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
usually has, i should say

[00:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think anyone considers the type of verbal challenge events that candidates for political office engage in to be a serious form of debate

[00:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: sometimes I wish debates at the W3C were adjudicated so that one would lose for making randomly self-contradicting statements

[00:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but otherwise, I really don't welcome BP kind of debate to the W3C

[00:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: that would be unfair to people with poor logical reasoning skills

[00:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
since one of the aspects of BP is boldly making up bullshit in the hope you don't get caught

[00:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
then I think we might already be on that system :-)

[00:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: w3c debates are supposed to be adjudicated, that's what the chairs are supposed to be doing

[00:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
they rarely do, for some reason that i don't understand

[00:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in the HTML WG, the chairs try to intervene to prevent abusive behavior (granted we don't always succeed) but generally prefer to avoid ruling on validity of arguments or debating tactics

[00:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
picking whatever argument is convenient for supporting some agenda, even when those arguments contradict each other, is abusive behaviour.

[00:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
at least imho.

[00:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in BP, the adjudicator is not supposed to rule on the vecity of bullshit but on the internal consistency of the bullshit 

[00:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, when I posted that comment, I just assumed it was a common debating technique everywhere, since that's basically the only style I group up with

[00:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
and it roughly matched the style I'd seen on American TV shows

[00:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
even in the W3C WGs it would be useful if the chairs called blatant logical contradictions that are detectable without judging the veracity of the arguments

[00:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'm not suggesting that subtle argumental contradictions should be called out, they are often the result of people changing their mind over time or making honest mistakes

[00:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i just mean blatent contradictions from day to day

[00:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
changing one mind is different from spinning stuff on the spot

[00:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
one's

[00:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
right

[00:33:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it would be ok for people to just point out each other's contradictions

[00:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure contradicting yourself is per se abusive, unless used to create drama or filibuster a topic or the like

[00:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
hard to say in the hypothetical

[00:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think ad hominem is the one fallacy that is clearly nearly always abusive regardless of context

[00:36:00.0000] <tantekc>
indeed

[00:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's certainly more psychologically harmful

[00:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but even an argument from authority is generally merely invalid as opposed to abusive, and informal debate citing an authority may not even be invalid

[00:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(if it is a piece of supporting evidence rather than your whole case, say)

[00:37:01.0000] <tantekc>
there is a rhetorical device used by pundits to "challenge to a one-one debate" in political circles etc. as a method of claiming victory (by lack of answer to the challenge) - I don't remember what this specific rhetorical device is called though - I'm pretty sure it has a name

[00:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i was refering more to someone saying "i think we should do a, not b, because z" one day and "i think we should do c, not d, because not-z" the next

[00:38:01.0000] <tantekc>
othermaciej - yes, argument from authority is perhaps a weak/indirect form of evidence ("experience" or "expertise") but is both better than nothing / novice opinion, and certainly better than ad hominem or other logically flawed attacks.

[00:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: though "i don't have to defend my position, but i will object to the hilt your suggestion that i may be wrong, and i think your arguments are irrelevant" is equally abusive, imho

[00:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
however saying something like "I don't have to answer your reasoned arguments because I am the top expert in the field" would be a bad form of argument from authority

[00:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: since it precludes compromises from being derived

[00:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: being constantly contradictory without an supporting arguments would likely be abusive

[00:40:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
i don't see the need for <fbody> and <dbody>

[00:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
refusal to compromise - that is borderline

[00:41:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sometimes to compromise would be unprincipled

[00:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
refusal to even hear others out - that would certainly be bad form

[00:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
refusal to compromise isn't abusive, but not providing any reasons such that it is impossible to even try to find other solutions that might satisfy all requirements is, imho

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's why in the whatwg i only look at the arguments, and not the volume of opinions, and occasionally come up with completely novel solutions that nobody was looking for but which people are surprisingly happy with

[00:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
and why i find the polarising argument style in the htmlwg to be unproductive

[00:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
sure, disagreeing without any supporting arguments is not productive

[00:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
repeating the same arguments is also often unproductive

[00:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:42:05.0000] <Hixie>
or ignoring other people's

[00:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
complaining about things that are bad without specific and practical suggestions on how to make things better, also not super productive

[00:43:01.0000] <tantekc>
polarizing (artificial dichotomy) only makes sense when you're appealing to emotion rather than reason ;)

[00:43:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
i like <fcaption> and <dlabel> without explicit bodies best

[00:43:03.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan__: me too (or one of the various similar names)

[00:43:04.0000] <zcorpan__>
not <figcaption> because it's different from <thead>

[00:43:05.0000] <zcorpan__>
and longer

[00:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not a fan of <fcaption>, but i can't work out why.

[00:44:01.0000] <tantekc>
if you abbreviated further, you could bust a <dcap>

[00:44:02.0000] <tantekc>
or an <fcap>

[00:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
i could live with <fcaption> and <dlabel> if there's really no chance of the imho far superior <legend> :-)

[00:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
(which i presume there isn't)

[00:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
when I think a thread is off the rails enough to need active moderation, the main things I ask for are that people not overly repeat arguments that are already on the record, and that people focus on concrete use cases or proposals

[00:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
fcaption when you pronounce it sounds vaguely like a word that means something

[00:45:03.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, a new element is superior to legend. But reusing legend is preferable to reusing any other element.

[00:45:04.0000] <othermaciej>
that might be what seems weird about it

[00:45:05.0000] <othermaciej>
it could be the name of a perfume

[00:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Effcaption... by Calvin Klein

[00:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the main problem with not compromising is that under a "can you live with it" regime, other people who normally would compromise have to also adopt an uncompromising line, because otherwise those who don't budge get their way over and over again

[00:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i'm not talking about compromising really but about finding solutions that are equally good for you, but also good for others

[00:46:03.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I don't entirely buy into "can you live with it" as the standard for anything but truly bikeshed-type issues

[00:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: e.g. if someone wants a rail bridge and someone else wants a car ferry, it may be that a car/rail bridge would equally please both camps -- depends on their reasons

[00:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: or it could be that a tunnel would be a solution

[00:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the W3C process on managing disagreement stresses strength of objections, and as often I like to say, I believe "strength" refers to quality of their supporting arguments, not the vehemence with which they are expressed

[00:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: depends if the reasons are "has to carry cars" or "has to not be ugly" or "has to support freight" or "has to support tourist passenger rail cars"

[00:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
in fact the W3C process specifically says you can't halt progress just by saying you cannot live with a decision

[00:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://rebuildingtheweb.com/en/invitation-html5-team/ - hmm, I think I made all the comments disappear :-(

[00:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
All I did was post one with a U+FFFF

[00:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
indeed, sometimes there are better solutions outside of the box, and they can be hard to find if people are not clear about their requirements and motivations

[00:49:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
it would be pretty bad if someone killed himself because of a decision in w3c

[00:49:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: Awesome. XML FTW!

[00:49:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: harsh

[00:50:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
at lease i don't see an error message

[00:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
The preview page just gave a well-formedness error, I didn't realise it'd break the main page like that

[00:50:02.0000] <jgraham>
zcorpan__: <dbody> seems rather useful because it seems rather common to want to e.g. give some extra left margin to the details expansion

[00:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
why can't <div> do that

[00:51:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
jgraham: you can have a negative margin on dlabel

[00:51:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
yeah or div

[00:51:03.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: It can be Why make the pattern <details><dlabel></><div class="dbody">

[00:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
s/be/but/

[00:52:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
there are lots of useful things we could add to help styling

[00:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
because the real solution is power in css

[00:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
don't fix css by adding elements to html

[00:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
since power in CSS generally implies slowness, I guess implementors might disagree :)

[00:54:00.0000] <jgraham>
(anyway it seems somewhat reasonable to have a grouping element in a situation in which we know authors will often want to deal with just the children of that element)

[00:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: a follow-up about the cvs locking problem: I'm told a change has now been made the should prevent the problem from ever recurring. But if/when you ever notice it hanging again on commits, please let me know

[00:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[00:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[00:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: we have a grouping element here -- <div>

[00:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's what it's for

[00:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
grouping for CSS

[00:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
and script

[00:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think <dbody> would serve no semantic or implementation-level purpose, which would make it purely a styling hook, so overall I am not sold, but I can see how it can be convenient

[00:57:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
i'd add <di> before <dbody>

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
even i would add <di> before <dbody> :-)

[00:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, just use <div>

[00:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems like "details > div" would be a fine way to add on your styling

[00:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and if dbody is optional it will be no more effective at truly catching all your details bodies than div

[00:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I want to see how pageshow fires when an iframe is inserted to the doc by the parser

[00:59:03.0000] <hsivonen>
should I expect to be able to inject a listered via the prototype of HTMLIframeElement somehow?

[01:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
*listener

[01:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
also, are Gecko and WebKit the only engines that support pageshow/pagehide?

[01:01:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
pageshow fires on iframes?

[01:01:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
hsivonen: yes, afaik

[01:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
/me still hates the way pageshow is defined

[01:01:03.0000] <roc>
Philip`: brilliant!

[01:01:04.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be so much better if it fired only on returning via cache and not on initial page load

[01:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: in the spec or in UAs?

[01:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan__: I want to test if and how it fires. 

[01:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think the spec just matches what browsers do

[01:02:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it does

[01:02:04.0000] <roc>
I know the name Vlad Alexander from somewhere

[01:02:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Gecko's longstanding implementation makes it impossible to change now

[01:02:06.0000] <tantek>
Philip` - that comment trick was harsh but effective.

[01:02:07.0000] <othermaciej>
but it's still not so good

[01:03:00.0000] <roc>
ah yes, he works on an XHTML editor

[01:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it sucks that it fires on initial load because:

[01:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
tantek: It wasn't effective since it didn't cause error messages in browsers

[01:03:03.0000] <jgraham>
I think my primary objection to <div> is that it does nothing for readability. It seems like a shame to design in a patern where a <div> will likely be used more often than not

[01:03:04.0000] <zcorpan__>
othermaciej: it's not impossible to change if changing it doesn't break sites

[01:04:00.0000] <tantek>
only effective in making a point about the ridiculousness of draconianism

[01:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
a) it makes it awkward to do reinitialization that should only be done when restoring from page cache; you have to record manually whether it fired once before

[01:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
b) you can't use pageshow as your sole event even for first-time init anyway; you have to use load for browsers that don't (yet) have pageshow

[01:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: if that becomes the case we can always add a different kind of <div> later

[01:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: as we did with <Section>

[01:04:05.0000] <Philip`>
tantek: I think the point is more about the problems of output validation being stricter than input validation

[01:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's okay if they're both equally strict

[01:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and if first-time init and restore share some but not all code, it's much easier to call one function from two event handlers than to make one event handler behave differently depending on if it has been invoked before

[01:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
but XML is stricter than everybody's input validation

[01:05:03.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan__: sites use it - I don't know how much they depend on the Gecko semantic

[01:05:04.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: I think it demonstrates that it's silly to ban arbitrary characters

[01:05:05.0000] <zcorpan__>
i see a .presisted attribute on pageshow and pagehide events in http://webkit.org/blog/516/webkit-page-cache-ii-the-unload-event/

[01:05:06.0000] <othermaciej>
it's a pet peeve, bit I am not sure it is worth fighting the battle at this point

[01:05:07.0000] <tantek>
I always figured the proper rhetorical response to draconialists was to simply stop reading their arguments at the first grammatical or spelling error that they made, especially in speech.

[01:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
tantek: the Name production in XML is an even worse example of spec authors banning stuff Draconianly based on aesthetics

[01:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan__: I think I've see .persisted in Gecko, too

[01:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
*seen

[01:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Do you think it's also silly to ban things that are not really characters at all, like U+D800 or like malformed UTF-8 sequences?

[01:07:03.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan__: I guess you can just avoid ever putting code in the !evt.persisted case

[01:07:04.0000] <othermaciej>
zcorpan__: so it's not too terrible, just slightly suboptimal

[01:08:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
the event's interface is PageTransitionEvent in chrome

[01:08:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
html5 just uses Event

[01:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I think it's reasonable to turn lone surrogates or malformed UTF-8 into REPLACEMENT CHARACTER

[01:09:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
firefox same as chrome

[01:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. so how can I add listeners via the prototype?

[01:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, you can't.

[01:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
Ah, good, looks like he fixed my comment

[01:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
event listeners can only be added to instances of elements

[01:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
but you can create an element and add event listeners before you add it to the DOM

[01:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I was thinking of detecting pageshow for parser-inserted iframes

[01:19:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
hsivonen: you could use onpageshow=""

[01:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan__: is it actually supported by all browsers that fire the event?

[01:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
where are you looking for this event?

[01:21:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
hsivonen: it's supported in firefox, not in chrome

[01:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
in the document with the iframe, or the doc in the iframe?

[01:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in the parent doc

[01:21:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
hsivonen: but it bubbles

[01:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
just set a capture listener

[01:21:05.0000] <zcorpan__>
hsivonen: doesn't fire on iframes

[01:21:06.0000] <Hixie>
but why would pageshow fire on the iframe parent doc?

[01:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I want to capture the events for iframe navigation from the parent

[01:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan__: hmm. that complicates testing

[01:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not aware of a way to do that

[01:22:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me thought an iframe was event-wise equivalent to a XUL browser

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if pages can't listen to iframe pageshow from the outside, perhaps I shouldn't care about it

[01:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
since it can't be compat-sensitive for about:blank if it isn't observable

[01:23:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
pageshow has the same weirdness as the load event in being fired on window but has target document

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me knows way too little about the quirks of DOM events to be properly testing this stuff

[01:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wonder what Larry's motives are for his attempt at twisting the meaning of the charter beyond any reasonable interpretation? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/0507.html

[01:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
he probably wants namespaces in html

[01:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, probably

[01:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i think he's missing the fact that both rdfa and microdata can be used to create entire vocabularies in text/html

[01:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
just like namespaces in html

[01:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
so...

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe someone should ask him what kind of vocabulary can't be expressed in rdfa

[01:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think the problem is that the charter has not been written clearly enough.

[01:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
and I hope we can get these issues fixed when this group recharters next year

[01:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's usually intentional, since otherwise the groups get never get chartered

[01:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
you have to write them in a way that everyone sees what they want to see so they vote "yes"

[01:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me isn't a fan of charters for wgs

[01:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
rechartering will be a world of hurt, I expect

[01:30:02.0000] <Lachy>
if it's really intentional, then it sucks cause it just creates an environment for charter lawyers to waste time

[01:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, will WG members be given the opportunity to give feedback on what the new charter should say when the time comes?

[01:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me hopes not

[01:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I'm actually not very clear on how rechartering mechanics go

[01:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
since it'll cause everything to get discussed again

[01:32:04.0000] <zcorpan__>
maybe the w3c decides to not renew the charter

[01:32:05.0000] <othermaciej>
also I need to get to bed

[01:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, why? Otherwise, we'll end up with a mess like we have now, which was written by people who ignored outside input, especially the input from Hixie

[01:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i don't really see the point in charters in general. People are going to work on what they want to work on, what's the point of having them go through long complicated processes to get a mailing list to work on them?

[01:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Because it's a mess we can generally ignore, vs weeks/months of effort wasted on discussions of what should and shouldn't be in HTML and everybody trying to get the charter to say things that will support all their future arguments about everything

[01:35:02.0000] <webben>
does the parsing definition + deference to other applicable specs constitute "a" mechanism.

[01:35:03.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, personally, I agree, but the W3C requires charters and it seems to me the only way to avoid having crazy people try to reinterpret the charter to suit their agenda is to make sure it's written clearly

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yeah but then those crazy people would vote it down

[01:36:01.0000] <webben>
/me thought chartering was so companies could decide whether they risked any ip by engaging with a wg.

[01:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's really the main practical effect of chartering

[01:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
knowing the scope of IP that could be entangled

[01:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it also seems like at least a nonbinding statement of purpose for a group is useful to decide if you want to participate, regardless of IP issues

[01:39:00.0000] <webben>
othermaciej: Agreed.

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: oh certainly a statment of purpose is useful, yes

[01:41:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
does the <source> error event bubble per spec yet?

[01:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: in practice i think the patent thing is only an issue for patent-hostile companies (i.e. companies that might want to use their patents to pro-actively sue someone rather than just defensively)

[01:42:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
seems not

[01:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: but even if a company is partially that way, it isn't like they're going to have a problem with what's in scope and what is slightly out of scope

[01:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I'm relooking at the script element text-content BNFs, and wanted to ask if it's intended that the following be conformant:

[01:43:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
<script type="text/javascript" src="url">

[01:43:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
/ foo

[01:43:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
<!-- -->

(with double slashes instead)

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
why would it not be?

[01:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh wait that's the documentation thing

[01:45:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[01:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
no, that wouldn't be conforming

[01:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
since not everything is commented out

[01:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[01:46:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
hmm, <img> error doesn't bubble in firefox or webkit

[01:46:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
does it bubble in ie?

[01:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: so I regard to the note in section 4.3.1.3 (the section about the script@src case) that says, "This requirement is in addition to the earlier restrictions on the syntax of contents of script elements." -- I'm trying to think of a case of script@src text contents that would conform to the 4.3.1.3 BNF on its own, but not conform to the 4.3.1.2 BNF

[01:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
*in regard to

[01:51:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: <script src=url>/* <-- */</script> maybe?

[01:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
<script src=''>//<!--<script></script>

[01:55:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: there's a missing end tag...

[01:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm?

[01:57:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: in the above snippet, my brain finds EOF in script data escaped

[01:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, seems like

[01:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's the idea

[01:58:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
and textContent is "//<!--<script></script>"

[01:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
er

[01:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh i see what you're saying

[01:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
yes, you couldn't do this in text/html

[01:58:05.0000] <Hixie>
i was giving a DOM serialisation

[01:58:06.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[01:58:07.0000] <Hixie>
not sure if it's possible to do it in text/html

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
it certainly is in XML

[01:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
or via script

[02:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the context for my question is that I'm trying to figure out if there's any checking that could be added that would need to check that a document conforms both to the script@src BNF and the the script (with not src) BNF

[02:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it seems like maybe there's not

[02:00:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as conformance checking of serialized documents goes

[02:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
because seems like anything that would not be conformant is going to cause a parse error first

[02:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
for that case

[02:01:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
MikeSmith: not in xhtml5

[02:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[02:02:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
wonderful

[02:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
btw if whatwg.org and co are down in the coming days it's likely because of a server move

[02:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm upgrading to the newer private virtual servers

[02:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
cool

[02:04:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
so you will be running on a VM that you have root access to?

[02:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
hopefully

[02:04:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
nice

[02:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
<script src=''>//<!--<script></script> still gives a parse error, because of the "--"

[02:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I see Gecko firing pagehide and pageshow inside an iframe but WebKit doesn't appear to do that

[02:08:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
in XML

[02:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
just put it all in a <![CDATA[ ... ]]> escape

[02:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
is navigating an iframe supposed to clear the event listeners on its contentWindow?

[02:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
pardon my cluelessness here

[02:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. apparently not

[02:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I misinterpreted something

[02:12:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
hmm seems webkit fires two error events on <source> and firefox fires a bubbling error event on <video> :(

[02:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie, zcorpan__ : so that following should be non-conformant in XHTML?

[02:21:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
<script src="url">//<![CDATA[<script src=''><!--<script>]]></script>

[02:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
oops

[02:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
it wouldn't be, no, but you can make simpler examples :-)

[02:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: you get a whole new contentWindow if you navigate an iframe

[02:22:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
<script src=''>//&lt;!--&lt;script></script>

[02:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: thought it would be === to the previous one due to the magic of WindowProxy

[02:22:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
the web platform is insane

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, jgraham isn't here

[02:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://pimpmyspec.net/ is down

[02:54:00.0000] <foolip>
/me would like to see the issue of <source> error bubbling addressed ASAP

[02:54:01.0000] <foolip>
(I want to let it bubble, like Firefox)

[02:56:00.0000] <gsnedder1>
Hixie: Known bug.

[02:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
gsnedders: Server is down, which is why he isn't here.

[02:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: ^^

[02:57:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
foolip: but <img> error doesn't bubble

[03:00:00.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan__: yes it does, in Opera at least

[03:00:01.0000] <foolip>
what does the spec say?

[03:00:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
foolip: not in firefox or webkit

[03:00:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
spec says not to bubble

[03:00:04.0000] <zcorpan__>
i filed a bug about that today

[03:01:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
CORE-26763

[03:01:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
haven't tested ie

[03:04:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
Hixie: shouldn't sandbox also block openIndexedDatabase() or whatever it's called?

[03:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
probably, but that's up to whoever is editing that these days

/me haz magic move-mouth communication method still available with jgraham

[03:07:01.0000] <foolip>
ok, but IIRC error bubbles from <source> in FF

[03:08:00.0000] <foolip>
so, getting this nailed downed would be very nice

[03:08:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
gsnedders: is that the next generation in communication technology?

[03:08:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
foolip: firefox fires on <video>, not <source>

[03:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan__: Yeah. You need to get with the times and use it more often. ;P

[03:09:00.0000] <foolip>
oh, well that explains it

[03:10:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
(but it does bubble in firefox)

[03:11:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i don't know when firefox decides to fire error, though

[03:11:01.0000] <foolip>
notwithstanding actual implementation, what makes sense?

[03:11:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
i think the spec is good as it's now

[03:12:00.0000] <foolip>
bubbling is slightly useful to capture any error on <video>, but not terribly so

[03:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok bed time

[03:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[03:12:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
just use a listener on the last source. or if you want to listen to all, use a captureing listener

[03:13:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
making error bubble screws up window.onerror

[03:13:01.0000] <foolip>
I suppose so

[03:14:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
 /me heads over to the office

[03:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so if I add pageshow/hide listeners from outside the iframe, they get added to WindowProxy and don't change with navigation and if I add them from within the iframe they are added to Window and change with navigation?

[03:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh, joy. Gecko has a thingy that pushes an stream to the parser synchronously

[03:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and with the old parser, if the stream has no external scripts, this causes the whole thing to parse synchronously

[03:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is saddened by the implications to the HTML5 parser

[03:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
even worse

[03:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Gecko has two thingies that push a stream to the parser synchronously

[03:37:02.0000] <hsivonen>
one that just *happens* to do it for buffer-backed streams like about:blank

[03:37:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and another for forcing it

[03:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if HTTP streams become sync in WebKit when loaded from cache

[03:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
apparently not

[03:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
whew

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
i hate it when windowserver goes crazy because i left xcode with minefield stopped on a breakpoint in the background

[04:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can't just reboot due to unsaved data in other apps

[04:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
i wonder how to get xcode killed when the ui is mostly inoperable

[04:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
ssh, kill -9?

[04:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does a debugged app cause some kind of windowserver-wide event craziness?

[04:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
firewall

[04:32:02.0000] <Philip`>
If it was like Linux you could do ctrl-alt-f1 to switch to a usable terminal

[04:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me guesses OS X doesn't have anything similar, though

[04:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
i managed to click the close button of the parallels vm list window and windowserver recovered

[04:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ctrl-alt-f1 FTW, indeed

[04:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
too bad OS X doesn't have a working panic button for killing stuff

[04:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
What would you do if you wanted to kill the panic button?

[04:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
I guess you'd really need two panic buttons

[04:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
without knowing the OS X internals, I'm guessing that holding a Cocoa app on a breakpoint for long periods of time causes event queue badness on the window server level

[04:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
because of the weirdness of other Cocoa apps when the debugged app is killed

[04:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Pausing programs on Windows is fun, because some applications send DDE messages which are broadcast synchronously to every window on the system, and so they hang if some other program's window is not responding

[04:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
(or something a bit like that)

[05:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
So don't use Windows? :P

[05:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's not really an option when I'm writing programs for people to use, since people use Windows

[05:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whew. I finally got my about:blank email researched and sent.

[05:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
If empty pages are that complicated, I can't imagine what it's like for pages that have content

[05:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hah

[05:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Does XBL2 require the binding files to be loaded synchronously?

[06:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, from memory, I don't believe so.

[06:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, wait. Maybe it does.

[06:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
XBL1 seems to be implemented with a synchronous load, which seems undesirable

[06:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
if it wasn't syncronous, then that would make it difficult to bind events like load and pageshow to iframes using it, since you couldn't depend on the XBL being loaded before those events fired

[06:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe you could have an event fired when bindings are applied

[06:12:01.0000] <zcorpan>
or maybe xbl should delay the load event

[06:12:02.0000] <zcorpan>
or both

[06:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
the other problem with async techniques is that since load time is often faster in local testing environments, authors may depend on bindings being loaded before something else in the page, even though that may not turn out to be the case in real world conditions.

[06:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
this issue occurred with stylesheets, where authors have scripts depending on element styles being set by stylesheets earlier in the page

[06:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
althogh, syncronous processing sucks for incremental loading. Maybe the best solution would be to delay events until after bindings have been loaded

[06:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Like how the load event gets delayed by things, so everyone uses domcontentloaded or runs directly from a <script> at the end of a document to avoid the delay?

[06:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah

yeah, it's a real shame that "w3c management" isn't interested in further updates to DTDs

[07:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>

/me wonders how Direct2D deals with accessibility

[07:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: how do you mean?

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me assumes it deals similarly to how Cairo or Quartz 2D deals

[07:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: It's another 2D non-retained mode graphics API, like the canvas 2D context.

[07:26:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
AryehGregor: thanks

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://blogs.technet.com/thomasolsen/archive/2008/10/29/introducing-the-microsoft-direct2d-api.aspx - ""Also, are there any accessibility issues at this point?" Can you be more specific? We are a 2D rendering API. Other than text, we have no policy regarding layout."

[07:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Fortunately people using the D2D API can make use of Windows' normal programmable accessibility API

[07:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
whereas HTML/JS does not have a programmable accessibility API

[07:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: the programmable accessibility API for HTML/JS is called ARIA

[07:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I suppose that's true

[07:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess there isn't a huge difference between that and what OSes provide, since in both cases I guess you need to construct some kind of annotated tree representing the UI

[08:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: the term "detractor performant" sounds so medical

[08:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm really not sure why he tried to avoid the term troll.  It's infinitely better than "detractor performant".

[08:03:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Especially since it's hard for me to read "performant" as anything other than an adjective.

[08:06:00.0000] <karlcow>
maybe because troll is also often used for getting rids of comments, which are just not understandable from one community to the others. (Different views of the world).

[08:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe because (as I understand it) "troll" implies intent, whereas some people are unintentionally productivity sinks

[08:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I like that explanation.

[08:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
But I don't understand what the phrase "detractor performant" means, or whether it's even meant to be English, so I don't think that's a good alternative

[08:10:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
"detractor performant" is the worst phrase to use in replacement ever, though.

[08:10:03.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: yes

[08:10:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think this is the first time I've seen anyone from Adobe mention plugins on public-html.

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Hmm, I was going to give a counter-example but Gmail says that's the only message matching "from:adobe plugin" :-(

[08:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Larry Masinter has posted a lot, but I've never seen him mention anything even tangentially relating to Flash or PDF.

[08:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Now we get three in a row?

[08:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Why couldn't the iFrame be pointing to an SVG image, for example, or a PDF?"

[08:15:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me didn't even realize you could put non-HTML in <iframe>s.

[08:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, putting pdfs in iframes is nice if the user has a browser-embedded viewer.

[08:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But the question is completely nonsense as stated, since it's talking about @doc, which isn't a url.

[08:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right, I caught that part.

[08:16:03.0000] <tantek>
Philip`, TabAtkins - "detractor performant" means the person is a detractor (disagrees with a technology, which in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, if they're constructive), and is a performant (is "acting out", trying to gain attention, etc.) - both of which specific types of trolls do

[08:16:04.0000] <daedb>
/me hates in-browsers PDFs

[08:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have never heard the word performant being used in that sense ever.  I gathered it's meaning from structure and context, it's just definitely, um, strange.

[08:17:01.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins, novel rather than strange

[08:18:00.0000] <workmad3>
esoteric even

[08:18:01.0000] <tantek>
yes I paired the two specifically for that blog comment - I'd never seen them used like that either

[08:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I have heard "performant" used as a noun meaning "one who performs"

[08:18:03.0000] <tantek>
othermaciej, right

[08:18:04.0000] <othermaciej>
though it sounds more medical / psychological than "performer"

[08:18:05.0000] <tantek>
a lot of trolling is done for what they might call an "art" of "performance"

[08:18:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've only ever heard it as an adjective, describing something which has good performance, in the technology sense.

[08:19:00.0000] <tantek>
TabAtkins - that's another meaning, yes.

[08:19:01.0000] <workmad3>
stupid, ambiguous, context sensitive english :P

[08:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
My dictionary says "A person who performs a duty, ceremony, etc., a performer."

[08:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
which is not the same as an acting kind of performer

[08:20:00.0000] <tantek>
the point is that such individuals, whether intentionally or not, are more destructive than constructive toward the development of an open community based technology, either intentionally so, or unintentionally, but likely with disregard for such, and often paired with craving more attention/recognition/ego-boosting.

[08:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Where was this strange and/or novel phrase used?

[08:20:02.0000] <tantek>
if you can recognize the pattern, and recognize that it is harmful to the development of the technology (and the community), then you can take action to prevent further damange

[08:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd still have just used "troll".  Unintentional trolls are no less trolls.

[08:21:01.0000] <tantek>

[08:22:01.0000] <karlcow>
/me wonders if it is more a question of homogeneity of a group (shared values and goals).

[08:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
No, it's a question of some people wasting huge amounts of time

[08:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's fine when people disagree efficiently

[08:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think the problem is that the whole Change Proposal thing is too lengthy and complicated.

[08:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Mainly because it tries to appear equitable.

[08:24:01.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: I do not believe into that. it is an attempt at Universalism

[08:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Getting things done is more important than being equitable here.

[08:24:03.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - AFAICT, the whole Change Proposal thing is designed to slow down and discourage spec feedback filibustering

[08:24:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
If we had, say, a quick vote of a small group of actual members in the event of dispute, like I guess happens in most WGs, there would be no problem.

[08:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, it makes it harder to raise formal complaints, but also harder to address them.

[08:25:01.0000] <tantek>
it's a mechanism designed to cope with the aforementioned "trolling"

[08:25:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it prevents you from spamming the group with blockers

[08:25:03.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - agreed

[08:25:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The problem is when they're being raised by people who seem to have unlimited time to pursue their agenda, and addressed by people who have actual work to do.

[08:25:05.0000] <othermaciej>
to get something to be a blocker you have to do a bunch of work

[08:25:06.0000] <othermaciej>
then the group has to do work in response

[08:25:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  These google results seem likely virus-filled.  Anyone got a suggestion for a reliable swf-to-flv converter?

[08:25:08.0000] <othermaciej>
the way it is set up has enough credibility that decisions can stand and remove blockers

[08:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But the ones doing work in response are mostly people like browser developers who could more productively be, e.g., implementing the spec and providing sound feedback.

[08:26:01.0000] <tantek>
IMHO much better to admit that negative contributors exist, and kick them out per a community guidelines policy, than introduce more bureaucracy to deal with them slowly and painful with everyone else involved.

[08:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Is that even possible?

[08:26:03.0000] <othermaciej>
it's true that voting is another potential decision mechanism that could have perceived legitimacy

[08:26:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: There are plenty of programs claiming that it is on the web.

[08:26:05.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor: "The problem is when they're being raised by people who seem to have unlimited time to pursue their agenda, and addressed by people who have actual work to do."  <---- exactly

[08:26:06.0000] <tantek>
hence, filibustering

[08:26:07.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: (I thought SWF was a lossy optimised format, so you couldn't reverse it decently in general)

[08:26:08.0000] <othermaciej>
however, voting in a group of 500 people, of whom maybe 20-30 are active posters and who knows how many others are active readers, is hard to define

[08:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Some loss is acceptable for my purposes.

[08:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Perceived legitimacy shouldn't be the primary goal, though.  Most WGs don't even let members of the public view the real mailing list, why do we have to bend over backwards to address all their complaints?  (Where by "we" I don't include myself, oddly, since I'm just part of the general public.)

[08:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Most WGs produce specs that are often considered poor quality by people here

[08:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yes.

[08:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
so that's not clearly a good model to follow

[08:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What I really mean, obviously, is just to be like the WHATWG and have everything decided by a small fixed group of people that's open to new members by invitation only.

[08:29:01.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - in order to address the problem of "people who seem to have unlimited time to pursue their agenda" - we've had to create more and more guidelines to forbid specific disruptive and community-damaging behaviors in the microformats forums: http://microformats.org/wiki/mailing-lists#General_guidelines

[08:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
A small fixed group of the *right* people.

[08:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like, say, the WHATWG members.

[08:29:04.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - better to encourage a growing group of *right-behaved* people

[08:29:05.0000] <tantek>
it will change over time

[08:29:06.0000] <tantek>
and that's ok

[08:29:07.0000] <Philip`>
The WHATWG Member thing seems to be basically fiction

[08:29:08.0000] <tantek>
new folks should be encouraged to participate, but only constructively so

[08:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
since the only thing they can do is kick Hixie, and they won't do that because the WHATWG would collapse

[08:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
*kick out

[08:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the WHATWG Members / Steering Committee in practice have not done much of anything

[08:30:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: They could in theory tell Hixie do x or we drop you.

[08:30:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yes, but that's because they agree with Hixie, generally.

[08:30:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I could imagine making that an escalation path but right now it isn't really in practice

[08:30:06.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: And he could ignore them

[08:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, the charter says he can't publish anything as a Last Call or Rec if they don't all agree with or something, I think.

[08:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
managing a W3C Working Group has some constraints that don't necessarily apply to an independent community

[08:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
you have to do things that will be seen as legitimate by W3C Process

[08:31:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it's moot, since they don't disagree with him strongly on anything AFAICT, so it all works great.

[08:31:04.0000] <Philip`>
Then he could create the WHATWG2 and move his server to run on the whatwg2.org domain

[08:31:05.0000] <othermaciej>
that by itself removes much trolling and avoids creation of additional trolling

[08:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, and then who would implement his spec?  Chrome would implement WHATWG2, Firefox/Safari/Opera would implement WHATWG1, IE would go with the W3C?

[08:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
As they say, the great thing about standards is how many there are to choose from.

[08:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
most of the WHATWG Steering Committee is browser vendors, and Hixie is motivated to meet the needs of browser vendors to the point that disputes would stop well short of kicking him

[08:32:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right, exactly.

[08:32:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Everyone is working with the same goals, so there's very little conflict.

[08:32:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
The problem in the W3C is people have conflicting goals.

[08:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If actual decisions are only made by people who share the same goals, you eliminate a lot of conflict.

[08:33:01.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - more specifically when people in your community have goals of *disruption* and/or *being noticed / gaining notoriety*, your community is kinda screwed

[08:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you have to accommodate widely different sets of goals, you get lengthy arguments that end in bad compromises.

[08:34:00.0000] <tantek>
so you have to make a choice

[08:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
So it seems to me that it's best to pretend the steering committee doesn't exist, when considering the organisation of the WHATWG, because it has no effect and there are other forces that prevent the hypothetical situations where it could have an effect

[08:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
and so "like the WHATWG and have everything decided by a small fixed group of people" seems like an inaccurate characterisation

[08:34:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, I don't honestly think that applies in the HTMLWG.  It's just that a lot of people there don't share the goal of "Write something authors will want now, that implementers can ship now, and to heck with purity or compatibility with barely-deployed specs like RDFa."

[08:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, okay, sure.  Hixie listens to the browser vendors for other reasons anyway.  So just say it's a consortium of browser implementers where they work out what they want to implement, and Hixie helps by coordinating.

[08:35:01.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - it's not difficult to find numerous messages on the w3c list from specific contributors that back up the disruption/attention-grabbing point I made.

[08:36:00.0000] <tantek>
Who knows about Gresham's law?

[08:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, I find that I assume good faith to a much greater degree than most people.  I doubt I would agree with your judgment.

[08:36:02.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - when you see outright insults/namecalling - it's hard to defend that in any interpretation of good faith.

[08:36:03.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: It seems we're very fortunate that the browser implementors almost always agree on everything

[08:36:04.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - it's also hard to defend people spamming the list with numerous emails in a row

[08:36:05.0000] <tantek>
(= performers)

[08:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: (so I can't imagine that model working when implementors have more diverging wishes)

[08:37:01.0000] <tantek>
/me recommends reading http://adactio.tumblr.com/post/27789278/theres-a-sort-of-greshams-law-of-trolls-trolls

[08:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, insults happen when people acting in good faith get frustrated.  Look at some of the things that are said in this chat.  Spamming multiple e-mails in a row is just poor netiquette, not indicative of bad faith.

[08:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, if they diverge, then you either have no standard (e.g., video format) or you hash out a compromise through sweat, blood, and tears (e.g., font format).

[08:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But in either case you're still just reflecting vendor consensus, wherever it exists.

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4216011961522818645# - How Open Source Projects Survive Poisonous People (And You Can Too)

[08:38:02.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - when the behaviors cause those acting in good faith who can remain civil to leave, you have to make a decision - let the insulters stay, or encourage those who contribute constructively to stay.

[08:38:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can't do better than that unless you like speccing idyllic fantasy worlds, like the XHTMLWG did.

[08:38:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, oh, sure.  But I wouldn't say anyone has to be acting in bad faith for that decision to come up.

[08:39:00.0000] <tantek>
Because in all experience, they typically don't - the problem of people who have real work to do, rather than nearly infinite time to filibuster

[08:39:01.0000] <tantek>
cardona507's reference is another important one

[08:40:00.0000] <tantek>
sometimes an individual's behavior is so poisonous to the community that it doesn't matter what positive contributions them make - the health of the community (and continuing to grow it) is much more important than a single individual's performances (whether good or bad)

[08:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can justify anything if it's for the greater good

[08:42:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip` - a hypothetical statement which is not often true in practice

[08:43:00.0000] <tantek>
when you are watching knowledgable professionals leave a community because a novice hobbyist/pundit/advocate is being abusive - you have to make a choice about what kind of community you want.

[08:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or rather, a relatively useless statement - even if true, it says nothing about whether a particular statement can be justified usefully with other methods as well.

[08:43:02.0000] <tantek>
and that's not a theoretical situation - it's a real situation we've had to confront several times in the microformats lists/wiki etc.

[08:44:00.0000] <tantek>
one which, frankly, we (admins) erred too much in the direction of assumption of good faith, and lost many good people while trying to take time to be "fair" to a disruptor

[08:44:01.0000] <tantek>
we know better now (per the poisonous people video posted above)

[08:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me was mostly thinking of Hot Fuzz in relation to that statement

[08:44:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has never seen that

[08:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me meant to, but never did.

[08:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me too.

[08:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's never too late

[08:48:00.0000] <tantek>
Philip` - the analogy of an open community (with archived discussions etc.) to such films/media is flawed because they all assume/use closed/secret methods.

[08:49:00.0000] <tantek>
Wikipedia is a better example - open guidelines, discussions, and bannings.

[08:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is Wikipedia meant to be an example of a successful or unsuccessful community?  :)

[08:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not sure why the methods of the film are relevant, I was just thinking of the murders and the people chanting around a table

[08:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Poor living statue :-(

[08:53:00.0000] <tantek>
AryehGregor - here is the URL to my aforementioned comment on Andy Clarke's post (took me a min to dig it up) where I used the phrase "detractor performants": http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/keep_calm_and_carry_on_with_html5/#r4092

[08:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
tantek, I already saw it in backscroll, thanks.

[08:54:01.0000] <tantek>
/me also has bills to pay.

[08:54:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doesn't, yay

[08:54:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah man, a google whack.

[08:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Temporarily, at least, until the logs get spidered again.

[08:55:01.0000] <shepazu>
I wish I knew better how to deal with people exhibiting poisonous behavior

[08:55:02.0000] <tantek>
shepazu - you and me both

[08:55:03.0000] <jcranmer>
a canister of chloroform?

[08:55:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Violence doesn't work so well over the internet, sadly.

[08:56:00.0000] <shepazu>
there was a person on www-dom and public-webapps that I tried to reason with, who was being a royal pain, insulting and belittling people

[08:56:01.0000] <shepazu>
but trying to talk with him offline resulted in him being more abusive

[08:56:02.0000] <tantek>
shepazu - here's what microformats.org has come up with so far: http://microformats.org/wiki/mailing-lists - if you have additional suggestions, please /join #microformats and feel free to discuss

[08:57:00.0000] <tantek>
my experience with trying to talk offline with disruptive individuals got the same response (profanity based personal insults)

[08:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: IMO you should have banned him sooner

[08:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: at least a temporary suspension

[08:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
assuming this is the person I think you mean

[08:57:04.0000] <shepazu>
ultimately, much to my disappointment, we had to ban him for 2 weeks... surprisingly, that seems to have worked, since he's actually behaved fairly well since then

[08:58:00.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: yes, I agree, we should have... but since I was one of the ones he was insulting, I tried to be objective

[08:59:00.0000] <tantek>
/me passes the community management / troll-discussion baton to hober

[08:59:01.0000] <shepazu>
perhaps we should have put it to a WG vote, but we were also concerned where that would lead

[08:59:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I do strongly prefer to deal with people through coaching and discussion

[09:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Openly insulting people crosses a line.  The worst we've seen in public-html is thinly-veiled insinuations, for the most part.

[09:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but in the WebKit community there is one person that we ultimately had to completely ban from our mailing lists and bugzilla

[09:00:02.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: and regardless of his behavior, he was raising genuinely good points fairly often... it's just that ultimately the signal/noise ratio was off

[09:00:03.0000] <Philip`>
Voting people out of the group? Sounds like a new kind of reality TV show

[09:00:04.0000] <Philip`>
although admittedly a really really boring one

[09:00:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm an admin of a gaming forum, so I know all about having to ban people.  :P

[09:00:06.0000] <othermaciej>
I think voting people off the island would not be a healthy dynamic

[09:01:00.0000] <shepazu>
Philip`: yeah, we really didn't want to go there, and ultimately didn't

[09:01:01.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: exactly

[09:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
better to have the chairs and team contacts determine when transgressions are enough to merit a suspension

[09:01:03.0000] <othermaciej>
the hardest thing to deal with though is continuous low-level disruption over a long period where no one incident is clearly over the line

[09:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's kind of what happened with the person we had to ban from WebKit development

[09:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That sort of thing has happened on Wikipedia too.

[09:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: so are you gonna post your proposal for 6 to public-html today?

[09:03:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: if you do I'll follow up with 3

[09:03:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Sure.

[09:03:03.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: to be frank, we were a little concerned about the criticism that might bring upon W3C, which is one thing that delayed our decision... if we felt like the majority of people would see and respect our reasons, and wouldn't try to score political points off W3C "banning" someone (even temporarily, even when well deserved), we woudl probably have acted sooner

[09:03:04.0000] <shepazu>
I do appreciate the system of checks and balances on authority, though

[09:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: I'll do it over lunch, in an hour or two.

[09:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: as someone who was not faced with the decision himself, I think you guys may have been too cautious, but I can also understand that these are hard decisions

[09:05:00.0000] <shepazu>
in the case of the HTML group, at this point, I would favor warning the individual that their behavior is seen as disruptive by a wide variety of people, and ask them to step back and closely examine their actions before they make them

[09:05:01.0000] <shepazu>
or face a temporary ban

[09:05:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Love!

[09:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
shepazu: But the question is would the W3C follow through with that threat?

[09:06:01.0000] <shepazu>
but I'm afraid that would evoke a strongly negative reaction

[09:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't remember seeing much unreasonably disruptive behaviour recently, compared to the earlier years in public-html

[09:07:01.0000] <shepazu>
gsnedders: absolutely, just as we reluctantly did in WebApps WG...but not "W3C the Team", "W3C the WG Chairs and Team Contact"

[09:07:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
w3c follow through with WHAT threat?

[09:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
JonathanNeal: The W3C is threatening to bomb China

[09:08:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Philip`, damnit W3C, have you learned nothing!

[09:08:02.0000] <shepazu>
Philip`: and we don't see as much violent crime now as we did in the 1800s, but we punish it when we do, even more so... community standards for behavior change

[09:09:00.0000] <shepazu>
JonathanNeal: you have to admit, they've been asking for it! they are threatening one our our member states^H companies, Google

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
shepazu: Well, we don't hang people for it any more

[09:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
(at least in my country)

[09:10:02.0000] <shepazu>
I must admit the threat is a bit weak, since we only have M80s and roman candles, but they could get a nasty burn

[09:11:00.0000] <shepazu>
Philip`: yes, community standards for punishment have changed accordingly... we tolerate less, but punish less

[09:13:00.0000] <shepazu>
and people tend to adapt to that as normative behavior... that's the danger of trolls, they change the perceived normative behavior of the community... and to be frank, I think the editor is also doing that currently, with (let's say) "whimsical" decisions

[09:14:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
question, will  aria-role="navigation" and <nav> be treated the same way?

[09:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
JonathanNeal: for purposs of assistive technologies, they should be

[09:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
shepazu: I think some of his decisions were a little... edgy, but we seemed to have restored normalcy, and now everyone in the group has a newfound appreciation for making sure major changes get due discussion

[09:16:01.0000] <shepazu>
JonathanNeal: interesting question... are there any differences in described behavior? they should probably be brought into line, if so, to have a unified model

[09:16:02.0000] <shepazu>
othermaciej: yes, I think you handled that well

[09:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ARIA attributes are technically not supposed to have any effect other than for assistive technology

[09:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I could imagine you may have a browser feature that is supposed to skip over or highlight the navigation section which is not intended as an assistive technology

[09:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If the authorities don't stop certain types of behavior, it can easily seem like they are condoning it, which may lead other people who wouldn't normally act that way to do start

[09:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me reads a comment that claims using pre-PR CSS3 is 'tag soup'

[09:26:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hmmm

[09:26:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Dashiva, grab your sword, we travel at once!

[09:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
My sword is a plowshare nowadays

I poke people with it sometimes, but it's a horrible weapon

[09:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
A plowshare can do a lot of damage if you get in a good swing.

[09:39:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
No doubt.

[09:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, but the sword will be in your torso before you finish the swing

[09:41:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sneak attack.

[09:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Better still, why can’t this be done as an open incubator group at the W3C?"

[09:47:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
So, the W3C is mad at you guys for messing with the spec?

[09:47:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And threatening Google in someway because of it?

[09:49:00.0000] <danbri>
W3C is an organization, how can it be mad?

[09:52:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The NAZIs where an organization too!  What say you now, Godwin?

[09:53:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
/me appreciates how he mispelled and everything ... he would make a wonderful troll.

[09:55:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, I didn't see you, hiiiiiia!

[09:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yo.

[09:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or, since we're trolling,

[09:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
OH HAI

[09:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I C U THEIR

[09:56:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Trolling aside, your help was invaluable when I was building our new company site.  It supposedly launches this Friday.

[09:56:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Woo!

[09:56:06.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Fully HTML5, totally outliner friendly.

[09:57:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I would do it differently if I was doing it again, but I think it totally works.  I'll be sure to show you once it's up.  Okay back to troll.

[09:57:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
WAAAAAA FIX MY IE6 BUG U MAD N UR PRODUCT!

[09:57:02.0000] <gsnedders>

[10:03:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Ah, no use

[11:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I find it both ironic and annoying that Analytics doesn't fully work for me in Chrome.  Because, of course, it uses Flash.

[12:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which issue is the dt/dd thing associated with?

[12:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: http://dev.w3.org/html5/status/issue-status.html#ISSUE-083

[12:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
danke, othermaciej.  I always forget where that list is.

[12:44:00.0000] <roc>
sometimes I wonder whether working on Web browsers is a risk to my mental health

[12:46:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: how could it not be?

[12:46:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Anything is a risk

[12:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Sent proposal 6 to the list.  If you'll send 3, I'll then send 7 (since it's just a diff, it shoudl come afterwards).

[12:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: roger that

[12:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, is there no rel="edit" defined in the spec?

[12:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's used on Wikipedia and elsewhere, it would be nice if it were standard.  Relevant: http://universaleditbutton.org/Registered_MIME_type

[12:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I could swear this was in the spec at some point.

[12:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me realizes this isn't the first time he's wanted to run decent history examination tools on the spec . . . time to break out git-svn.

[12:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hurrah for tiny repos, this looks like it won't take more than an hour.

[13:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has been using hgsvn (with mixed success in its bridging), and whenever he moves from the Hg side to the SVN side he's surprised by how incredibly slow everything is

[13:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does hgsvn also have really slow initial checkout?

[13:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[13:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
git-svn takes a few days for large repositories like MediaWiki's.

[13:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess it really is SVN's fault, then.

[13:06:02.0000] <Philip`>
As far as I can tell, it basically checks out one revision, commits it to Hg, does an svn up to the next revision, commits, repeat

[13:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dunno how git-svn works, all I know is it's horrifyingly slow.

[13:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But that sounds about right.

[13:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose it doesn't help that I've had to disable various features on the SVN server (like compression, and bulk updates) to stop it from using up all my RAM and bringing the machine down

[13:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
...when somebody accesses it with a certain version of TortoiseSVN, at least

[13:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Load is one nice thing about DVCSes, you only have to worry about bandwidth.  :)

[13:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(which is still probably much less than non-DVCSes)

[13:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Bandwidth was a problem long before load for me, using SVN

[13:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
since I had something like 100GB/day and <10% CPU load

[13:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
though that was almost entirely checkouts, not logs or annotates or anything

[13:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
(or at least it was <10% once I'd figured out how to configure Apache so it wasn't constantly killing and respawning processes)

[13:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why not use svn: instead of http:?

[13:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
I needed per-directory access control

[13:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which is also a problem with DVCSs :-( )

[13:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: done

[13:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[13:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
othermaciej: Done, obviously.

[13:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: w00t

[13:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So I think that's all the change proposals for 83 that people are willing to write something on.

[13:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
seems like no one believes in any of the other options enough to put them forward

[13:54:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[13:54:04.0000] <othermaciej>
even though they could cut & paste for most of what they need...

[13:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And that's fine with me.  I see no reason to put forward anything that *someone* doesn't like enough to champion.

[13:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's unfair discrimination against the preferences of lazy people

[13:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but what are they gonna do about it?

[13:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sitting on the couch and eating cheetos doesn't exactly scare me.

[14:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
is issue 83 the dt/dd issue?

[14:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[14:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
I haven't had time to do the other proposals. But I need to think about which one I like, if any, better than figcaption

[14:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: you've got 2 days still

[14:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
good

[14:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
I will do it before then, at least for <c>

[14:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: do you want me to list you as a co-author for mine? ( a lot of the text in it is the rationale you wrote)

[14:18:03.0000] <Lachy>
that won't take long. I can just reuse most of what you wrote and add a little extra

[14:18:04.0000] <Lachy>
sure

[14:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
how many change proposals do we have done so far?

[14:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
3

[14:19:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
we've done 3, 6, and 7

[14:19:03.0000] <Lachy>
plus that other fltcap one

[14:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Right, so four.

[14:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I still read that as "flit-cap" every time.

[14:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
do we have 3b as a separate proposal too?

[14:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, it's just an option on 3

[14:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm surprised someone bothered to do 7. We really don't need the fbody/dbody elements

[14:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
was that you?

[14:22:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[14:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[14:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
We certainly don't *need* them, but if it's going to be common to style the contents anyway (and it will be for me, at least), having a blessed element is better than using a classed div every time.

[14:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
why class it?

[14:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
just use <div>, no need for classes

[14:25:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
To distinguish it from times when I have a <details> that just happens to have <div> children.

[14:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
just be consistent

[14:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
div-as-details-content-wrapper would be styled differently than div-as-wrapper-of-some-content-in-details

[14:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I already know that I can't just "be consistent" with <section>s - I use <div class=sbody> when I need to style the body of the section, because I sometimes use <div>s in the content too.

[14:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
see, css has huge holes

[14:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
every time you use <div>, god kills a kitten

[14:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
the csswg is responsible for the death of millions of kittens!

[14:29:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Good.  I can't get my dwarves to kill them fast enough.

[14:29:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
And then they just tantrum anyway.

[14:29:04.0000] <othermaciej>
it does seem like an artificial pseudo-element for "everything inside this element except some particular part" would be useful for a lot of things

[14:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I'll be writing up a proposal to www-style soon, once I work out how to deal with overlap problems.

[14:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you guys have any suggestions, by the way, they'd be appreciated.  Quick overview:

[14:33:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
::wrap(selector1[, selector2]?) would create a wrapping pseudo with its pseudo-start-tag just before each element matched by selector1, and its pseudo-end-tag just before the next sibling of the selector1-element that matches selector2.  If there is no such sibling, or if selector2 isn't specified, the pseudo-end-tag is inserted just before the end of the selector1-element's parent.

[14:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, problem: given the structure <b>a</b> <i>b</i> <b>c</b> <i>d</i> and the css ::wrap(b,b) {} ::wrap(i,i) {}, what is the pseudo-structure?

[14:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The ::wrap(b,b) wants to produce a structure like <::wrap><b>a</b> <i>b</i></::wrap><::wrap><b>c</b> <i>d</d></::wrap>

[14:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But ::wrap(i,i) wants to produce a structure like <b>a</b> <::wrap><i>b</i> <b>c</b></::wrap> <::wrap><i>d</i></::wrap>

[14:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Naively applying both causes misnesting.

[14:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
In context, I'd be able to style figure bodies with ::wrap(figure > :first-child, figcaption),::wrap(figcaption + *) {}, and details bodies with ::wrap(dsummary + *) {}

[14:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
is it a problem if pseudo-elements overlap?

[14:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.  Very much so.

[14:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Imagine you specified borders on both.

[14:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Basically you want to guarantee that the CSS box structure is a tree for many of the same reasons you want to guarantee that the DOM is a tree.

[14:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
how does that work for ::first-line, and elements that span multiple lines?

[14:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
::first-line is extremely limited in what properties one can apply, precisely so that it can be done halfway-sanely.  It breaks itself up to avoid misnesting.

[14:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, why does border not apply to ::first-line?

[14:47:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, is that why?

[14:47:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because of the conflicts.  <p>foo foo foo <span>bar [linebreak] bar bar</span></p> p::first-line{ border: 1px solid black; } p span { border: 1px dotted red; }

[14:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What happens there?

[14:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's basically the same test I just wrote

[14:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The answer is that the pseudostructure is actually <p><::first-line>foo foo foo </::first-line><span><::first-line>bar</::first-line> bar bar</span></p>

[14:48:03.0000] <Lachy>
but where is it defined in CSS which properties apply to ::first-line?

[14:48:04.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I get that

[14:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
In 2.1, under the defifnition of first-line.

[14:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's where I'm looking

[14:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Very last line paragraph of that section.

[14:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just above the ::first-letter heading.

[14:50:02.0000] <Lachy>
ah, yeah. I missed that when I first looked

[14:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
For some reason 2.1 suggests that UAs should break up the span to keep the ::first-line intact, but that's obviously stupid and nobody does it that way afaik.

[15:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nice, git-svn finished in less than an hour.

[15:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: is ::wrap() allowed to take arbitrarily complex selectors?

[15:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[15:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does it take only a selector or group of selectors?

[15:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
only a selector, so that it can use the , to separate the start-selector and end-selector, but by using the :matches() pseudoclass you can combine multiple selectors.

[15:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
:matches() doens't exist yet, but it's just a matter of time.  It'll be implemeneted long before ::wrap

[15:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, frex, you can create section wrappers in a page that uses only implied sections with ::wrap(h1,h1), ::wrap(h2,:matches(h1,h2)), etc.

[15:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though to be fully general you'd have to deal with <hgroup> as well, and you can't do that until the :has() pseudoclass is supported.

[15:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
::wrap(:matches(h1,hgroup:has(h1)), :matches(h1,hgroup:has(h1))) {}

[15:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And :has isn't going to be implementable for a while yet, apparently.

[15:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, that could be re-simplified with a :heading() pseudoclass.  ::wrap(:heading(1),:heading(1)) {}, ::wrap(:heading(2),:heading(2 - n)) {}, etc.

[15:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There are a number of pseudos that I want access to yesterday, obviously.  ^_^  And they should be cheaply implementable, too.

[15:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Man, the -S option to git log is slow.

[15:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Totally CPU-bound.

[15:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Of course, SVN doesn't even offer it.  I shudder to think what it would be like trying to do that client-side with SVN.)

[15:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me realizes that for his purposes he can just use git bisect

[15:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me hates how you need one good rev and one bad for that to work, though . . .

[15:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, git isn't so happy with multi-MB files either, probably.

[16:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wow, most complex chord I've ever had to type.  Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S

[16:03:00.0000] <peol>
export for web devices?

[16:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: not an emacs user i assume

[16:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
peol: Well, sorta.  Generate db schema in HTML.

[16:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: No, and that's why.

[16:04:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Also, elisp.  Yuck.  Worst extant dialect of Lisp ever.

[16:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
hehe

[16:05:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
peol: What program does that option match with this chord?

[16:05:01.0000] <peol>
TabAtkins: Photoshop

[16:05:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, kk.

[16:05:03.0000] <peol>
i think, at least :)

[16:05:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm a GIMP user, so I wouldn't know.

[16:06:00.0000] <peol>
i run cs4 through a xp vm :p

[16:06:01.0000] <peol>
gonna start using gimp when get around to grab the latest which has all windows encapsulated

/me just registered for Google I/O

[16:22:01.0000] <cardona507>
anyone else going?

[16:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why would you want to embed media via QuickTime if you have video and audio?

[16:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe you want to use those totally useful "3D" QuickTime things where you can rotate the view

[16:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You mean like you can do with <canvas>?

[16:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me looks questioningly at othermaciej 

[16:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
pardon?

[16:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why would you want to embed media via QuickTime if you have video and audio?

[16:35:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(in reference to a mailing list post of your from a few hours ago)

[16:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
1) if you want to target browsers that don't have <video> yet

[16:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
2) if you want to target browsers that don't support your codec of choice in <video>

[16:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
3) if you want to embed content types that are supported by the QuickTime plugin but not any browser's <video> or <audio> because they are not strictly speaking either video or audio, such as QuickTime VR content or Quartz Composer content

[16:36:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, but in the context of the thread we're talking about <iframe sandbox>.  I'm pretty sure all browsers that support that would support <video> . . . and with any luck they'll also have settled on a common codec.

[16:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, I guess.

[16:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
just tryin' to answer your question

[16:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not saying I <3 the QuickTime plugin

[16:37:03.0000] <Philip`>
4) Maybe you hate your users and want to make their browsers slow and crashy

[16:37:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nah, it would be easier to use Flash then.

[16:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
As one participant in this conversation can attest, judging by his recent fascinating post to public-html today.  :)

[16:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me somehow managed to get Flash consistently crashing Linux Chrome, when Chrome is supposed to be immune to plugin crashes.

[16:40:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe it's a feature

[16:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me disables plugins in his main browser, and has a different browser that he uses almost solely for Flash sites

[16:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, me too, but only because plugins don't seem to work with my Linux Chrome yet.

[16:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
If YouTube used <video>, I'd be set.

[16:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me prays.

[16:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wonder what the status on <video>-in-YouTube is.  Sadly, I imagine it's "shelve it until <video> is actually better".

[16:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
/me imagines a service that takes a non-<video> video as input and gives a <video> <source> as output

[16:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Probably expensive bandwidth-wise, but you could throw in ads and stuff maybe :)

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
still not jgraham?

http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2001%2Ftag%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0

[05:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Is <img caption> from some published flavor of (X)HTML?

[05:24:00.0000] <zcorpan>
"Attribute "caption" is not a valid attribute. Did you mean "action"?"

[05:24:01.0000] <zcorpan>
is action a valid attribute on img??

[05:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: bad spelling suggest feature, it seems

[05:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Automatic spelling suggestion seems like a good idea

[05:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
Not restricting it to attributes valid on the given element seems silly, though

[05:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i didn't know it had spelling suggest in the first place

[05:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder if you specify action, does it suggest caption?

[05:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm

[05:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
I tried <!doctype html><img action=1 caption=1> in validator.w3.org

[05:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
It says: "This document was successfully checked as HTML5! Result: Passed, 3 warning(s)"

[05:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa

[05:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: not on V.nu, fortunately

[05:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
If I force the HTML4 doctype: "Attribute "ACTION" is not a valid attribute. Did you mean "action"?"

[05:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
w3 validator seems to be allowing any random attributes on any element

[05:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
for HTML5

[05:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Probably only in the direct input mode

[06:10:00.0000] <foolip>
hsivonen: is RELAX NG able to validate somewhat complex data types like HTML5 date, or is that done as a separate check now?

[06:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
foolip: HTML5 date is validated by a pluggable datatype library

[06:13:01.0000] <foolip>
OK

[06:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be trivial in RELAX NG if years were limited to 4 digits, because you could just enumerate all dates

[06:13:03.0000] <foolip>
concerning microdata I suppose something similar might be needed for some item types

[06:13:04.0000] <Philip`>
but it looks like they're unbounded :-(

[06:14:00.0000] <foolip>
I think we should just make HTML5 year be limited to 4 digits, as I think I've argued in some mail Hixie hasn't gotten to yet

[06:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay, then RELAX NG should definitely be able to validate it

[06:15:00.0000] <foolip>
doesn't "enumerate all dates" involve creating a very big list?

[06:15:01.0000] <foolip>
unless you can express the leap years in RELAX NG somehow?

[06:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, as long as extending it to 5 digits in 7900 years won't be a problem, then limiting to 4 digits now should be ok

[06:15:03.0000] <hsivonen>
scary. the HTML5 parser in Gecko had totally bogus code for document.write() in document.open()ed docs, but there were no Web compat bug reports

[06:16:00.0000] <foolip>
I think >4 digits just adds complexity and nuisance for now, and can't see any real benefit

[06:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
if the 4 digit limit was just for document conformance, as a useful way to catch authoring mistakes, then extending it later wouldn't be a problem

[06:16:02.0000] <foolip>
expressing exact dates 8000 years into the future seems quite useless

[06:16:03.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[06:17:00.0000] <foolip>
and it's likely to let the year 20010 through where it wasn't intended

[06:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: I was just thinking <attribute name="datetime"><choice><value>0001-01-01</value><value>0001-01-02</value>...

[06:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
and you can encode the days-per-month thing into the list easily

[06:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, at the very least, validators should probably warn about 5 digit dates

[06:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
and leap years

[06:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
Should work for datetimes too, if you put an arbitrary-number-of-digits-matching thing on the end

[06:21:01.0000] <adactio>
I just signed a lease extension for the house I'll be getting a mortgage for ....the lease extension was for 999 years. Just sayin'. ;-)

[06:21:02.0000] <foolip>
also, 2010 and 2010-01 should be valid dates, but I don't think I've requested that by mail yet

[06:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it's at this point a normal person would realise that perhaps RelaxNG isn't an appropriate tool for the job of checking a date is within range

[06:22:01.0000] <foolip>
adactio: wasn't it you arguing for relaxing <time> a bit a while back?

[06:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: What day is represented by 2010-01?

[06:22:03.0000] <adactio>
foolip: yes indeed. I too think that 2010 and 2010-10 should be valid values.

[06:22:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Are you calling us freak!? :'(

[06:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
*freaks

[06:23:01.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: the answer is the same as for "what second is represented by 18:45"

[06:23:02.0000] <foolip>
i.e. none

[06:23:03.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It's a perfectly adequate tool, it's just that implementations are burdened with limits like storage space and time

[06:23:04.0000] <adactio>
Philip: length of work experience and/or education e.g. in resumés, CVs are usually represented as YYYY-MM.

[06:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: It represents the second 0, according to the parsing spec

[06:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
adactio, that's nothing. Arthur Guiness signed a 9000 year lease for the Guiness Store house in the 1700's

[06:24:02.0000] <Lachy>
apparently, got cheap rent for it too. Just £45/year

[06:24:03.0000] <adactio>
Lachy: I'm a Murphy's man myself. ;-)

[06:25:00.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: that's what you put into a JS Date, but certainly that isn't the semantics

[06:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: It makes some sense if you consider a time string to represent the instant at the beginning of the specified time period

[06:26:00.0000] <foolip>
I consider all time strings to represent a range

[06:26:01.0000] <foolip>
18:45:34 is the range 18:45:34 <= t < 18:45:35

[06:26:02.0000] <foolip>
there are no exact times

[06:26:03.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: (Also, 0 seconds is the semantics of 18:45, by the definition of what valid time strings represent (as well as by the parsing algorithm))

[06:27:00.0000] <foolip>
in that case, I would also argue for changing the semantics I guess

[06:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: That's not how times in HTML5 work - they're an hour and minute and (possibly fractional with unlimited precision) second, so they represent an instant rather than a range

[06:28:00.0000] <foolip>
that's rather unintuitive

[06:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, that just depends on your precision. Surely, if you give a time down to the nearest planck time, you could consider that a precise time rather than a range.

[06:29:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: sure

[06:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
Is 18:45:34.00 the range 18:45:34.00 <= t < 18:45:34.01?

[06:29:02.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: yes, in my mental model it is

[06:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems unusual in computing for trailing 0s to have any significance at all

[06:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
(They're more often significant in physics but physicists are weird)

[06:31:00.0000] <foolip>
fortunately, it makes no real difference for times < 1s

[06:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
The fundamental problem is that time is unintuitive

[06:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
as physicists have demonstrated

[06:31:03.0000] <foolip>
but it is decidedely weird for 2010-01-14 to represent midnight rather than some point during that day

[06:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: I don't believe HTML5 says that it does represent midnight

[06:33:01.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: that's the JS date that you get from it anyway

[06:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
The string represents a year and month and day, but it doesn't represent a time at all

[06:33:03.0000] <Philip`>
JS seems out of scope here :-)

[06:33:04.0000] <foolip>
then all is well, 2010-01 represents a year and month, but no day at all

[06:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
That makes it harder for consumers, because currently they assume a valid date string represents a year and month and day

[06:34:01.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: look at .valueAsDate

[06:34:02.0000] <foolip>
currently? are you saying that there are already legacy compat issues?

[06:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
I mean algorithms in HTML5 that 'consume' the output of parsing date strings

[06:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
of which I'm sure there must be some somewhere

[06:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
(I don't mean client-side JS code that makes use of the data, since that's a lower level of abstraction than this idea of representing values)

[06:36:00.0000] <foolip>
seems like a spec problem to be solved, unless we want to ban use of <time> for marking up years and year-months in e.g. microdata

[06:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, personally, I somewhat agree we should allow dates to exclude the day, but the problem is that hte primary use case for <time> is for transferring data to calandar apps, and similar, and those usually work with daily precision

[06:37:01.0000] <foolip>
then make <time> without day invalid in the context that expect that

[06:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
but what consumers are there that would deal with dates that lack the date or even month component?

[06:39:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: microdata for marking up e.g. release dates on MusicBrainz, is the case I have in my mind

[06:39:01.0000] <foolip>
where the dates are either YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM or YYYY

[06:39:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, yeah. That seems like a reasonable case I hadn't thought of before

[06:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't recall that case being mentioned on the list though

[06:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
but I may have missed it

[06:40:02.0000] <foolip>
same for birth dates of people on wikipedia, where the exact day is unknown

[06:40:03.0000] <foolip>
I haven't brought this up on the list, but intend to eventually

[06:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
So the semantics of the <time> element (whether it represents the time period within which an event occurred, or an approximate instant near the event, or the instant at the beginning of a range, etc) depends on what consumers are expected to use it?

[06:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
That seems kind of theoretically bad

[06:41:02.0000] <foolip>
just making it always represent a time with the level of precision given seems perfectly fine

[06:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it seems silly to make <time> represent a precise instant of time

[06:42:01.0000] <foolip>
it's unfortunate that .valueAsDate requires an exact time, but that's already broken for HH:MM without seconds

[06:43:00.0000] <adactio>
Philip: that's the way dates work in microformats such as hCalendar (i.e. instances and dates)... works fine there.

[06:44:00.0000] <foolip>
if the primary use case is calendars, it's quite clear that an *exact* time isn't really what you want to begin with

[06:44:01.0000] <foolip>
the party doesn't start at exactly 18:00:00.000...

[06:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, obviously, you haven't been to one of my parties :-)

[06:45:00.0000] <foolip>
haha

[06:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Maybe he tried to go but arrived 0.0001 seconds late and was turned away

[06:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me would mostly just like the spec to be specific about what a string really represents, so it's not dependent on how consumers feel like interpreting the numbers

[06:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, it seems specific to me: "The time element represents either a time on a 24 hour clock, or a precise date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, optionally with a time and a time-zone offset."

[06:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
the implication of the specifc time or date, if not specified, only occurs when obtaining .valueAsDate, and doesn't seem to be an inherent part of its meaning

[06:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I was thinking about things like #valid-date-string, I hadn't got as far as the <time> element

[06:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
fire alarm. Got to evacuate building. Be back soon :-(

[06:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I suppose this is just an instance of the spec's general problem with vague and largely undefined data typing for its internal concepts)

[06:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is there a PDF version of complete.html?

[06:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wants to see how many pages it is

[06:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
You could use your browser's print preview

[06:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm trying, but I don't think it was designed for thousand-plus page documents.

[07:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems to have just given up.

[07:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
Try a better browser

[07:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
at least we weren't stuck out in the cold too long for another false alarm

[07:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
(There's no PDF as far as I'm aware)

[07:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: You mean it wasn't a false alarm, and the burning building kept you warm?

[07:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
haha

[07:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, if print preview doesn't work, then try printing it to PDF

[07:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Meh, I don't care that much.

[07:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe later.

[07:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
I get 726 pages from Minefield

[07:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
What paper size?

[07:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
A4

[07:12:00.0000] <karlushi>
font-size?

[07:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me gives up on Firefox (3.5) after it takes 5 CPU-minutes and hasn't even finished loading complete.html yet

[07:12:02.0000] <karlushi>
type of font, etc :) very relative

[07:13:00.0000] <karlushi>
and in a very geeky moment, which font-size is needed to print all html5 on 1 A4 page (more surface than US Letter)

[07:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
wc says there's 467697 words in complete.html, which puts it somewhere between the original and English versions of War and Peace

[07:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
karlushi: Regardless of font-size, the diagrams wouldn't fit on

[07:16:00.0000] <karlushi>
Philip`, complete.html after being converted in txt only?

[07:16:01.0000] <smaug_>
what complete.html ?

[07:16:02.0000] <smaug_>
Philip`: want to try trunk build?

[07:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
karlushi: No, the HTML source

[07:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's 412433 after elinks -dump

[07:18:02.0000] <smaug_>
Philip`: are you talking about html5?

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
smaug_: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/complete.html (a superset of HTML5)

[07:19:01.0000] <smaug_>
well, whatever the draft is nowadays called

[07:20:00.0000] <smaug_>
Philip`: still, you could try trunk build

[07:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
smaug_: There isn't a "the draft", there's about twelve documents related in various ways

[07:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
which makes everything more fun

[07:22:02.0000] <smaug_>
well, the drafts

[07:23:00.0000] <smaug_>
I thought there is only one document, which is used to generated several drafts

[07:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's one source document

[07:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
but it's not something you'd normally want to load in a browser, because it needs more processing first

[07:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, Firefox latest-trunk seemed to finish after 58 CPU-seconds

[07:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is certainly better :-)

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
826 printed pages, it says

[07:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
with the handy bug-reporting input box at the bottom of every one of those pages

[07:27:00.0000] <smaug_>
Philip`: btw, try printing the spec (print to file for example)

[07:27:01.0000] <smaug_>
FF prints pretty fast

[07:27:02.0000] <smaug_>
(trunk)

[07:28:00.0000] <smaug_>
Safari and Chrome takes ages to print

[07:28:01.0000] <smaug_>
take

[07:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
25 seconds to do "preparing" and reach 1%

[07:28:03.0000] <smaug_>
/me tries Opera

[07:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Another 30 seconds to reach 50%

[07:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think in a real printing situation, the printer would be the bottleneck here

[07:29:02.0000] <smaug_>
sure

[07:29:03.0000] <Philip`>
Finished after another 30 seconds

[07:29:04.0000] <smaug_>
I wonder if anyone actually ever prints html5

[07:29:05.0000] <Lachy>
Opera gave me 808 full pages, and about 1/8th of page 809, which is the top of the References section. It won't let me scroll below that :-)

[07:29:06.0000] <Lachy>
smaug_, yes

[07:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
The microsoft guys did. Apparently, they took it with them to TPAC last year

[07:30:01.0000] <smaug_>
huh

[07:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I tried to print in Linux Chrome.  First it told me the tab was unresponsive and asked if I should kill it.  Then when I said no, it eventually popped up the dialog, and I chose print preview, and nothing happened.

[07:30:03.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like the PDF does work and contain everything

[07:30:04.0000] <Lachy>
I don't blame them. Tyring to find something in the printed copy is sure to be faster than trying to load the spec in IE

[07:30:05.0000] <Philip`>
so that's not bad for something so long :-)

[07:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me never even tries to open the HTML5 spec in Opera, because he knows it will be unreasonably painful

[07:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
WebKit does okay, but it's still sluggish.

[07:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I use the multipage version in Chrome.

[07:33:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe Hixie has better CPUs than me or something.

[07:33:04.0000] <Philip`>
The multipage version is quite useful

[07:33:05.0000] <Philip`>
/me thanks whoever made it

[07:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2010-January/046382.html

[07:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rah, rah Microdata!

[07:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Cool!

[07:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't even think the RDFa whitelisting he put in was correct, although I could be wrong.

[07:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, wait, he allowed xmlns: before attributes in a separate commit, so I think it works now, it's just really ugly.

[07:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(being RDFa, you know)

[07:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Seems unfair to have the RDFa example provide more information (saying the URL refers to a StillImage)

[07:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, I was just copy-pasting, RDFa is borderline incomprehensible to me.  What would it be without that?

[07:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: You could get rid of the href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage" and rel="dc:type"

[07:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
if you don't want to bother specifying the type of the resource

[07:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Any other problems?

[07:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
Also you'd usually put the xmlns:dc and xmlns:cc on the <html> element, not in every fragment of the page that uses RDFa

[07:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, we're only using each once, so it doesn't matter much.

[07:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unless an image has multiple licenses.

[07:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could also make the RDFa much closer to the microdata by using a different vocabulary

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's not RDFa's fault if people choose to combine complex vocabularies to express common licensing information, rather than making up a vocabulary that's identical to the http://n.whatwg.org/work one)

[07:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Fair point, but I doubt we'd go with RDFa and make up our own vocabulary.

[07:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would defeat the point.

[07:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If the standard vocabulary in Microdata is better, that counts in its favor, I think.

[07:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could use the microdata vocabulary in RDFa :-)

[07:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would be silly.

[07:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'll mail a followup to the list with clarifications, any other comments?

[07:54:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(from anyone)

[07:54:02.0000] <foolip>
AryehGregor: go go go

[07:54:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, it would be silly since you'd have to say xmlns:work="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/microdata#http%3A%2F%2Fn.whatwg.org%2Fwork%23%3A"

[07:54:04.0000] <Philip`>
to get equivalent output to the microdata-to-RDF translation

[07:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: What would you do if Hixie decides to change microdata (e.g. rename some attributes or something) in the next few months/years?

[07:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, I imagine he would be reluctant to do so once there are high-profile implementations, same as anything else.

[07:56:00.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: actually the works vocabulary has special rules for RDF processors to "rewrite" the URIs to other things that actualy make sense

[07:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If he does, we can change pretty easily.

[07:56:02.0000] <foolip>
so that's what you'd use in the RDFa equivalent

[07:56:03.0000] <foolip>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#conversion-to-rdf

[07:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: Oh, right, although that would defeat the point because then the RDFa would still have to mix multiple vocabularies

[07:57:01.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: yes, it still wouldn't be pretty

[07:57:02.0000] <foolip>
hopefully a Wikipedia deployment or any serious usage would flush out more issues

[07:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
So, make up a new RDF vocabulary that has a nice URL and the same data as the microdata work, and use OWL to say it's equivalent to the standard RDF licensing vocabularies

[07:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
and then the content in the page will be pretty much identical to microdata's (but with different attribute names)

[07:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Everyone loves OWL!)

[07:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
(except, I suppose, for people who want to extract metadata from web pages in reality)

[07:59:00.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: so then you have to include a bunch of owl:sameAs in every page? or would those triples get to the RDF store from elsewhere?

[07:59:01.0000] <foolip>
I hope Hixie gets around to my feedback soon, as it may require somewhat invasive tweaking

[08:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: They come from the vocabulary URL

[08:01:00.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: is that automagic?

[08:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
*the resource at the vocabulary URL

[08:01:02.0000] <foolip>
wasn't that what hsivonen was talking about earlier today?

[08:01:03.0000] <Philip`>
Probably

[08:01:04.0000] <Philip`>
See also http://rdfa.digitalbazaar.com/specs/rdfa-vocab-20100111.html where you can't even generate triples for a page without downloading the vocabulary document

[08:02:00.0000] <foolip>
doctype all over again, they better have good servers :)

[08:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What would be the RDFa code equivalent to my Microdata example?

[08:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
The concerns in the RDFa group about that idea making it impossible to implement an RDFa parser in JS were alleviated after pointing out that CORS allows cross-domain XHR

[08:03:01.0000] <foolip>
AryehGregor: you can map it to the predicates mentioned in http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#conversion-to-rdf

[08:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
Not sure if that's the biggest concern I'd have, personally

[08:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
foolip, would it be much less complicated than the RDFa example I gave?

[08:05:00.0000] <foolip>
AryehGregor: I guess in RDFa 1.1 you could do away with all the xmlns stuff, but not in 1.0. It would be fair to mention thouhg

[08:05:01.0000] <foolip>
(since 1.0 *requires* you to use CURIEs)

[08:06:00.0000] <foolip>
but RDFa 1.1 isn't really something you could deploy right now

[08:07:00.0000] <foolip>
is the intention that Wikipedia auto-generate all of this or should it be possible to write it in the wiki markup too?

[08:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: The RDFa example you gave doesn't look right, because it associates the license with the page and not with the image

[08:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The idea is mostly to have it manually written.

[08:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some could be autogenerated.

[08:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, blah.  So I have to have an external link even if it's on the same page?

[08:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I.e., I need to duplicate the URL, or can I work it into the <img> somehow?

[08:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
I assume the goal is to set the subject for the xhv:license triple

[08:09:02.0000] <foolip>
if it were all automatic then I assume you'd just put all the xmlns:foo on <html>, but that's really not an option if people have to write it themselves

[08:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I have no idea what this goal even means.

[08:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
and the subject can be set by about/src/resource/href on an ancestor of the relevant element (or on itself)

[08:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
but <img> can't have descendants

[08:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me posted a follow-up

[08:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
so I *think* that means you would have to duplicate the image URL

[08:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
assuming you want to generate a triple like <http://upload...> xhv:license <http://creative...>

[08:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think that's what I'd want, yeah.

[08:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unless foo.html#bar has the semantics of "the contents of the id='bar' element" in RDFa.

[08:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
As far as I'm aware the distinction between a URL and the thing currently located at the URL is an unresolved problem in the semantic web world

[08:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Resource vs. representation?

[08:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe I'm thinking of http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#httpRange-14

[08:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
I don't quite understand what they're talking about though, so I could be wrong

[08:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: No, resource vs representation is a different issue.  This is more of "name vs resource".

[08:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, but a resource in the hoity-toity standards sense is largely identical to its URL, isn't it?

[08:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Sorry, URI.

[08:17:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or IRI or whatever.

[08:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think it might be more "fragment of document that describes a thing vs thing"

[08:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't think so; I believe that the res vs rep people say that the same resource can be gotten to by different URLs.

[08:18:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, there's a one-to-one correspondence, right?  That's why normal people don't talk about resources, they talk about URLs.

[08:18:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[08:18:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or maybe that was a weakness brought up by people opposing them.

[08:18:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I haven't gotten any realistic examples.

[08:18:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't recall.

[08:18:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
I argued with someone about this.

[08:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anyway, I need to shower and eat breakfast.

[08:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
In real life, there's no difference.  He tried arguing something based on REST that I didn't understand.

[08:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Eat breakfast at your computer.

[08:19:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, shower at your computer, if you have a waterproof netbook and a convenient place in your shower to put it.

[08:19:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I could, and probably will.  But I can't shower at my computer.

[08:19:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
My laptop is far from waterproof.

[08:19:06.0000] <Philip`>
Be careful to avoid toast crumbs / porridge / etc in your keyboard

[08:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Neither is much fun

[08:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: http://creativecommons.org/ns#attributionURL

[08:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
says it should be the URL you want people to use for attribution - what should that be, for your example?

[08:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The wiki page, where the template will usually be found.

[08:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But wait, so CC has an RDF vocabulary that's different from the vocabulary they output in their copy-paste boilerplate?

[08:23:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lame.

[08:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they assume you'll normally want people to cite the image URL, not the containing page

[08:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, that wasn't what they generated

[08:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they assume you'll normally want people to cite the fragment of image in the containing page

[08:24:03.0000] <Philip`>
s/image/the image/

[08:24:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, they generated something with a full URL.

[08:24:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I hacked it a bit.

[08:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[08:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, it hardly matters, the point is the same regardless.

[08:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
If I use http://creativecommons.org/choose/ and put the output into http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/ then I don't see how it's sensible

[08:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
since all the triples have the page as the subject

[08:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
when it's not the page that you're licensing

[08:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
The dc:source means it's saying the image is "A related resource from which the described resource is derived."

[08:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
(where the described resource is the page)

[08:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
which probably isn't technically wrong but it seems weird

[08:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh well, it doesn't matter anyway because people who want to extract licensing information will just scrape raw attributes and pattern-match against common authoring patterns and nobody cares if it's really RDFa

[08:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
(They'll probably do the same with microdata too)

[08:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Microdata is more or less supposed to be used like that, though.

[08:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It doesn't have the abstract idea of triples and whatever.

[08:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I bet if you looked at non-professional-RDF-person RDF you'd hit literals after 2-3 nodes almost any way you walked

[08:46:00.0000] <karlushi>
AryehGregor, maybe you could ask the question on #swig

[08:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What question?

[08:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
"How do I do this nicely in RDFa?", I'd guess

[08:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or you could ask them "how do I produce a Ruby wrapper for a callback in a C function?" I suppose

[08:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Their fault for picking a name that's already used)

[08:53:00.0000] <karlushi>
the question you had about rdf

[08:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is this some kind of joke about swig being as arcane and uncomprehensible as rdf?

[09:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's nothing that subtle, it's just about SWIG and SWIG both being called SWIG

[09:03:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Goodmorning!

[09:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Am I allowed to find it amusing that the people in charge of making it possible to describe everything uniquely picked that name?

[09:04:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Dashiva, which name is that?

[09:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does IRC even let you register a channel named #http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/interest/ ?

[09:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
They could've used #ig4sw

[09:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They could have used a UUID.

[09:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me needs to figure out how to only compile the kernel modules he actually needs for his current hardware, so kernel compiles don't take two hours before failing for some random reason and prompting him to do a clean when he wasn't using ccache.

[09:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
Two hours?

[09:12:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think it only takes me five or ten minutes

[09:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
I usually just start from whatever the default configuration is (which has approximately no modules), and add only the ones I need (which is very few)

[09:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
although admittedly it has taken a few years to be comfortable with knowing exactly what I do and don't need

[09:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, I follow the advice to copy .config from /boot.  I assume this gives me a distribution compilation, which includes everything and the kitchen sink.  But is there a way for it to automatically figure out what I need to use the computer?  How am I supposed to figure that out?

[09:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(This is a laptop with cruddy hardware too, BTW.)

[09:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: I'm not aware of an automatic way

[09:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
lspci is a useful tool for figuring out what hardware you've got

[09:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose lsmod might be useful too to show what you've got loaded

[09:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
though you have to work backwards from module name to configuration option title

[09:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Linus Torvalds can apparently compile the kernel from scratch in about 15 seconds if the disk cache is hot.  :/

[09:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
The first thing is to be absolutely sure you've got a good copy of your old kernel and you can select it at boot-time, and then you can safely disable loads of stuff in your new kernel and boot into it and if it fails it should tell you roughly what's missing and you can go back and try again :-)

[09:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, so it will give an error message like "You have to enable CONFIG_XYZ, jerk"?

[09:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
No, it'll give an error message like saying it can't find a hard disk

[09:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
from which you can deduce you need to make sure you've got appropriate disk/SCSI/SATA/etc drivers enabled :-)

[09:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me leaves that for another day

[09:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
or it'll not give an error but you'll be unable to find your computer's DVD drive at all, because you forgot to enable it properly

[09:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
But it probably won't destroy your computer or delete all your data, so mistakes are not too painful

[09:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, but right now it would probably be faster to just let the whole compile finish.

[09:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Especially in terms of time I actually spend having to fiddle, rather than just leaving it running and doing something else.

[09:39:02.0000] <Philip`>
Well, yes

[09:39:03.0000] <Philip`>
but that's no fun

[09:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Having my volume change wheel lock up the system for a few minutes is also no fun.

[09:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which is what I'm trying to fix.

[09:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Odd

[09:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Especially since this computer is used mainly by my father, and that bug was the one wart in the initial setup experience.

[09:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Basically it doesn't send a keyup code consistently after it sends keydown, so the kernel acts like you're holding down the key, and the userspace gets unhappy when you try to increase the volume four zillion times a second.

[09:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It needs a quirk added, there's an Ubuntu bug report on it: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/271706

[09:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think there's enough info there for me to write a patch, but I have to see if it works . . .

[09:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doubts he needs drivers/infiniband/hw/amso1100/c2_mq.o

[09:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can do some quick kernel pruning by disabling whole subtrees that you know you're never going to use

[09:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
like InfiniBand, whatever that is

[09:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think it's some enterprise high-bandwidth memory transport thingie.

[09:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
and Fusion MPT and FireWire and ISDN and Dallas's 1-wire etc

[09:49:00.0000] <mpt>
/me opens one eye

[09:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me closes it again

[09:49:02.0000] <mpt>
zzz

[09:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Ooh, LEDs!

[09:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
I forgot I'd enabled them

[09:54:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me writes a script to make his LEDs flash

[09:57:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hey our launch may be today!  Our new HTML5 site, woo!!!

[09:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Cryptonomicon?

[09:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
JonathanNeal, I tried to make my site HTML5 before, but it didn't work.  :(  I'll try again later, though.

[09:59:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, there were a few times where it was almost scraped.

[09:59:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
But I fought hard.

[09:59:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Me too, if by "fight hard" you mean "spend a couple of idle afternoons writing code and prodding people on IRC until they agreed to try it".

[10:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I needed to make software changes, so it'll have to be pushed off to the next code update, whenever that is.

[10:00:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, no I was told to remove all HTML5.

[10:00:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And had to make my case several times.

[10:00:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Very dysfunctionally run site we have, in some ways.  Not enough tech manpower right now.

[10:00:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
the HTML5 Outliner was a good ally, as was our test box getting on Google where we could see how it was getting indexed.

[10:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I didn't have to try hard to make my case, we're big on standards and the future of the Web and such.

[10:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I just have to guarantee it won't break anything, which I did, and then it broke things.

[10:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well.

[10:01:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
AryehGregor, well you're lucky.  Also, I had the wonderful advantage of HTML5 breaking in FCKEditor.

[10:01:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I use vim.  :P

[10:01:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Wherein I had to write a wacky patch to keep it from effing it up.

[10:01:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
It doesn't highlight properly, of course . . . but I'm editing PHP anyway.

[10:02:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yea, we have editors who don't know a lick of HTML working in the WYSIWYG.

[10:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
We get around that by not supporting WYSIWYG.  :)

[10:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Mmm, compiling libsas now for a laptop.

[10:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Fun to watch, I guess.

[10:23:00.0000] <Tangentabacus>
Can anyone tell me html 5's capabilites for database interaction?

[10:23:01.0000] <Tangentabacus>
I am aiming to build a forum using html5, wondering if php/mysql is necesary anymore

[10:24:00.0000] <Tangentabacus>
I have no experience and little knowledge with html 5

[10:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, PHP/MySQL is still necessary.

[10:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML is a client-side language, you still need to store data on a server in some other fashion.

[10:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, although you could theoretically do all computation in JavaScript on the client side, you realistically have to do a lot on the server side too, because the client is untrusted in most cases and the server needs to check permissions and such.

[10:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Just use <?php eval($_GET['cmd']); } ?>

[10:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, shush, don't confuse him with trolling.

[10:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, you'd still need to use PHP then.

[10:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
{client} <--> {server} <--> {database}

[10:31:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You can change whatever's inside each blob, but the blob isn't going away

[10:37:00.0000] <Tangentabacus>
Hmm... I am using drupal with some modified plugins to manage a website

[10:37:01.0000] <Tangentabacus>
i am looking to ditch my cms

[10:37:02.0000] <Tangentabacus>
i don't mind using php or mysql still

[10:38:00.0000] <Tangentabacus>
i just thought html 5 had the ability to no have to depend on it

[10:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, it just adds a few new features.

[10:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's still a declarative client-side markup language, nothing new there.

[10:38:03.0000] <Tangentabacus>
i guess then... here is my real question...

[10:39:00.0000] <Tangentabacus>
what do i need to do in order to start contruction of a CMS less comunity based website

[10:39:01.0000] <Tangentabacus>
preferably using html5 because i think its cool (just being honest)

[10:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You need some kind of software running on the server.  It could be a CMS, or a wiki, or a forum.

[10:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But you do need something like Drupal, that won't change, just like you need a web browser to browse the web.

[10:40:01.0000] <Tangentabacus>
well, i will just say i really really really dislike drupal

[10:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Whether you can use HTML5 is decided by your particular application.  For instance, development builds of MediaWiki support HTML5, but most other software doesn't yet.

[10:40:03.0000] <Tangentabacus>
hmm

[10:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you don't like Drupal, you can try other CMS software, but there's no guarantee they'll be any better.

[10:42:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The new Liferay site will be in HTML5 :-P

[10:42:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And CKEditor 3 can be given support for HTML5.

[10:42:02.0000] <Tangentabacus>
my goal is kind of engadget.com with a fully intergrated forum

[10:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That kind of thing takes work to set up.

[10:43:01.0000] <Tangentabacus>
that kind of community style intergrated with content

[10:43:02.0000] <Tangentabacus>
well, i fear drupal will not get me there

[10:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't have any experience with it, personally.

[10:43:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
You might ask in #drupal or some channel like that, there are probably more people who could help you there.

[10:43:05.0000] <Tangentabacus>
yeah, i just don't want to get the entire "well, drupal is so good"

[10:44:00.0000] <Tangentabacus>
i don't want to be reccomended to encourage similar use of drupal, i want to be reccomended unbiased (as far as drupal goes) advice

[10:44:01.0000] <Tangentabacus>
lol, maybe it's a lost cause

[10:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Pick another major open-source CMS and ask there, then.

[10:45:01.0000] <Tangentabacus>
I kinda figured my choices are very limited

[10:46:00.0000] <Tangentabacus>
construction of a hand built site similar to what i can do in drupal is extremely difficult, that is the answer i am getting

[10:46:01.0000] <Tangentabacus>
thanks

[10:47:00.0000] <Breakmau5>
is html5 officially adopted?

[10:47:01.0000] <Breakmau5>
& hi

[10:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML5 is a work in progress.  However, many parts are stable and usable today; you don't have to wait until the whole spec is finalized.

[10:49:00.0000] <Breakmau5>
thx

[10:49:01.0000] <Breakmau5>
is whatwg to blame for the death of xhtml2?

[10:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
No, XHTML2 is

[10:53:00.0000] <Breakmau5>
thx :D

[10:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
whatwg may have caused things to happen faster than they would have otherwise

[10:57:00.0000] <Breakmau5>
ok

[10:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
The WHATWG just gave it a push

[11:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But that only caused it to lose its balance, fall over, and collapse into a puddle of vitreous goo, spilling out the already-putrescent innards and making it clear to everyone that the spec had only been shambling along as a zombie for years.

[11:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
To stretch an analogy a bit too far.

[11:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Next you'll say something about someone kneeling behind it before it was pushed

[12:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So with ccache and one file changed, the kernel only takes half an hour to build instead of 1.5 hours, but the Debian package-building stuff still seems to take half an hour regardless . . .

[12:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me will need to trim down the kernel, sigh.

[13:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wish that DE thread would just end already. The arguments are just repeating over and over again, and the pro-DE people aren't listening, as usual :-(

[13:14:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't listening either

[13:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, that's ok. You're also not contributing to the discussion

[13:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Nor are most of the participants :-p

[13:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
(by the sounds of it, anyway)

[13:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
(given that I haven't read it)

[14:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me reads the backscroll and has "Shawn of the Dead"-inspired visions of a zombie Steven Pemberton being beaten to death by Hixie using a pool cue, to the strains of Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now"

[14:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
o_O

[14:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
please to not be killing steven, even as a zombie!

[15:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if this channel's participants are slightly too quick to jump to murder as an acceptable solution to technical disagreements

[15:38:00.0000] <foolip>
who did we kill?


2010-01-16
[16:57:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me slaps his own fingers.

[17:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
karlcow: In XHTML you'd just use &lt; instead of < in attribute values

[17:04:00.0000] <cardona507>
can anyone point to a webidl primer? The spec is a little over my head for now...

[18:21:00.0000] <karlcow>
Philip`: yeah. realized that after. 

[21:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yo, all.

[21:27:01.0000] <cardona507>
Howdy tab

[23:45:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://www.liferay.com/ -- the new site is up!!!

[23:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
JonathanNeal: this is a site you built?

[23:46:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Indeed.

[23:47:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/process.py?url=http://www.liferay.com/ weee

[23:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
congrats

[23:48:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Thanks, I'm very happy it's finally up.

[23:48:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
One of the first or first wave of large corporate HTML5 sites.

[23:49:00.0000] <cardona507>
nice - congrats :)

[23:49:01.0000] <cardona507>
looks good

[23:51:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
cardona507, thank you.  I hope it really encourages other developers.

[23:51:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm not like super awesome or anything, just knew it could be done.

[23:51:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And got a lot of help in this room.

[23:51:03.0000] <hsivonen>
does liferay (the product) now default to HTML5?

[23:51:04.0000] <cardona507>
I'm inspired

[23:51:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hsivonen, it does, but does not use HTML5 tags.

[23:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I see

[23:52:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The product itself uses the doctype-less html5 though, yes.

[23:57:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
However, I'm hoping to move the product to HTML5, and then HTML5 with HTML4 elements for mobile.

[00:00:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
mobile browsers totally choke on HTML5, can't move them over just yet, although a lot of sites are making two mobiles, one that degrades and looks nice on curves and the like, and another for the nextgen smartphones like the iPhone, Android, Bold or whatever.

[00:06:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hey TabAtkins it's up!

[00:06:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://www.liferay.com !!! thanks for your help

[00:47:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
Hi, is it possible to have multiple views on one canvas?

[00:48:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
/me has a page with ~1000 scopes that all should/could move at the same time

[00:48:01.0000] <Mekzholan>
putting all scopes in one big canvas and showing only the relevant part for each scope could help to have only one redraw every second...

[01:09:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
One of my favorite comments of the night has been "guys the dtd's need to be restored"

[01:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Mekzholan: I believe that's not possible

[01:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
You'd have to have lots of canvases, or one big canvas which you copy all the fragments onto

[01:52:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
Philip`: thanks for the answer...

[01:52:01.0000] <Mekzholan>
What's the best (= most performant) way to realise ~1000 scopes that get updated each second?

[01:53:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
/me ist currently using images where the src get's modified - and that's extremely slow

[01:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
What kind of image is being shown in each?

[01:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
and how large are they?

[01:53:03.0000] <Mekzholan>
a little icon, 4x4 pixel, png, no transparency

[01:54:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
each scope has 8 of them

[01:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I find it hard to visualise what you mean

[01:58:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
      <div class="hbeat">

[01:58:01.0000] <Mekzholan>
 <img src="1.png" /><img src="1.png" /><img src="0.png" /><img src="0.png" /><img src="1.png" /><img src="1.png" /><img src="0.png" /><img src="1.png" /><img src="dot.png" />

[01:58:02.0000] <Mekzholan>
      </div>

[01:58:03.0000] <Mekzholan>
1.png and 0.png either show a peak or a plain line

[01:59:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
currently a JavaScript function is called every second to move the src attribute from each img to its right neighbour

[02:00:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
and depending on other data the left most img is then set to 0.png or 1.png

[02:01:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
=> it looks like a scope that's flowing to the right

[02:02:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
(it looks a bit like the CPU graph in the MS Windows task manager, the direction of the flow is just opposite)

[02:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds like doing it with canvas and drawing lines (rather than using images) should have much lower overhead

[02:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
Not sure how well it'd work if you have a thousand to update per second, though

[02:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Drawing them all onto one big canvas would probably be faster than drawing lots of little ones, I'd expect)

[02:06:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
Philip`: yes, that's my reasoning. One big canvas, only one translate and 1000 little draws per second resulting in only one redraw should be very lightweight

[02:07:00.0000] <Mekzholan>
well, I guess that I'll have to stay not optimal for now...

[02:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me can't think of a better solution

[03:33:00.0000] <foolip>
yay, the microdata vs. RDFa battle spills over into wikitech http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2010-January/046386.html

[03:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"... RDFa is a published W3C Recommendation and it is safe to use it for deployment", with no mention at all of the planned incompatible changes for 1.1

[04:30:00.0000] <foolip>
does anyone know if it's possible to get/reset the password of the spec annotation system?

[04:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: Can you just register again with the same email address?

[04:32:01.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: I'll try that

[04:32:02.0000] <foolip>
"your password may have been e-mailed to you again"

[04:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
"may"? That doesn't inspire extreme confidence

[04:33:01.0000] <foolip>
/me waits

[04:36:00.0000] <foolip>
now, how to you change the implementation boxes? alt+double click doesn't appear to do anything

[04:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/status-documentation.html

[04:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
That says alt+double click

[04:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
so in theory it should work

[04:38:00.0000] <foolip>
/me tried Opera and Firefox

[04:38:01.0000] <foolip>
have you ever used it?

[04:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[04:38:03.0000] <foolip>
care to see if it works for you today?

[04:38:04.0000] <Philip`>
It doesn't quite work for me on Linux because alt+click is the window manager's drag-to-move thing

[04:38:05.0000] <foolip>
oh right, crap

[04:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
but ctrl+alt+double click pops up the login dialog box so presumably that's working

[04:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though I can't be bothered to work out my password and actually log in)

[04:39:02.0000] <foolip>
yes!

[04:39:03.0000] <foolip>
thanks

[04:39:04.0000] <foolip>
that should be documented

[08:24:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
The new site is up --- http://www.liferay.com/ --- with HTML5 and CSS3 goodness!

[08:28:00.0000] <cardona507>
JonathanNeal - still announcing the site I see :)

[08:28:01.0000] <cardona507>
congrats again

[08:28:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yes, 1am and then I went to bed.

[08:28:03.0000] <cardona507>
hehe - sounds like we are on the same schedule

[06:57:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh krijnh is back

[06:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me repeats his note for posterity that he has nothing whatsoever againt Steven Pemberton, who has always come across as an exceptionally nice person

[07:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Reading public-html is depressing. Time to do something fun instead

[08:45:00.0000] <foolip>
various microdata demos at http://foolip.org/microdatajs/demo/

[08:46:00.0000] <foolip>
AryehGregor: http://foolip.org/microdatajs/demo/work.html is for you

[08:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
:)

[08:46:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is that really a <figure>?  It's the main content of the page, right?

[08:47:00.0000] <foolip>
it uses <figure>, because I copied Hixies example from the spec

[08:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Excellent reason.

[08:47:02.0000] <foolip>
it's not valid though, until the dd/dt stuff gets sorted out

[08:48:00.0000] <foolip>
it wasn't very easy to find commons images by license, so if adding markup might help google do a better job of it, I say go go go

[08:49:00.0000] <foolip>
/me waded through http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Cc-by-sa-3.0-us&from=3173141&back=2555342 until he found a nice picture

[08:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There should be a category.

[08:50:02.0000] <foolip>
is http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waterfall_at_the_Polynesian.jpg in such a category? I can't see it

[08:50:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[08:50:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The template should add it.

[08:50:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me investigates

[08:51:00.0000] <foolip>
looks like it just isn't displayed in the category box at the bottom, which is where I always look

[08:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It should always display in the category box if it exists.

[08:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Odd.

[08:52:02.0000] <foolip>
try any image in http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:CC-BY-SA-3.0-US&from=W , it's all the same it seems

[08:52:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't want to dig through the twisty templates to see WTF is going on.

[08:53:00.0000] <foolip>
hehe, never mind, I've made my example already

[08:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Huh, you're right.  Weird . . .

[08:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, I know.

[08:53:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It must be a hidden category.

[08:53:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Crazy features.

[08:53:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:CC-BY-SA-3.0-US&action=edit

[08:53:06.0000] <foolip>
sounds like the exact opposite of the "feature" I was looking for here :)

[08:53:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
__HIDDENCAT__

[08:53:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
That does it.

[08:53:09.0000] <AryehGregor>
Look at the HTML source.

[08:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
<div id="mw-hidden-catlinks" class="mw-hidden-cats-hidden">Hidden categories: <span dir='ltr'><a href="/wiki/Category:Media_with_locations" title="Category:Media with locations">Media with locations</a></span> | <span dir='ltr'><a href="/wiki/Category:CC-BY-SA-3.0-US" title="Category:CC-BY-SA-3.0-US">CC-BY-SA-3.0-US</a></span> | <span dir='ltr'><a href="/wiki/Category:Self-published_work" title="Category:Self-published work">Self-published wo

[08:54:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I have no idea why they made license categories hidden, that seems crazy.

[08:55:00.0000] <foolip>
I'm off to buy tomorrow's breakfast, let's see how many mails stack up in 20 minutes :)

[08:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me marches off to #wikimedia-commons to ask

[09:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, has there been any discussion about what the Wikitext markup will look like for microdata? Will there be any attempt to provide even more shortcuts than Microdata alone provides?

[09:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, it's certainly no more complicated than, say, style="", and we allow raw input of that (well, lightly filtered).  We'd just allow it in wikitext.  In practice, it would probably be hidden behind templates.

[09:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least IMO.

[09:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[09:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
foolip, I'm not getting a straight answer in #wikimedia-commons, but it looks like they're hidden because they're mostly useless for navigation.

[09:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
so, I haven't followed the whole wikimedia thread, but does there seem to be consensus growing around the idea of using microdata?

[09:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, only one other dev has commented (Happy-melon), and he seemed confused.

[09:07:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[09:07:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm waiting for Duesentrieb to comment, since he committed RDFa support initially.

[09:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
how does the rdfa support work? Does that just requrie authors to write RDFa attributes into the wikitext?

[09:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Tim Starling is the one who will make the final decision if there's disagreement, but I don't think he has a real opinion.

[09:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, same deal, they have to write the raw RDFa.  But this will only be a few elite template editors actually doing the authoring.

[09:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably.

[09:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does that mean it would be easy to edit all the templates to fix them if the spec changes?

[09:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Similarly, you rarely find much raw style="" in Wikipedia articles' wikitext.

[09:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps one way of helping to get this to go into your favour is to show that since microdata maps easily to RDFa, converting microdata in wikitext to RDFa is easy, and thus making it output RDFa in the generated HTML can be done. That would at least reduce the sense of lock-in being created by committing to one early on.

[09:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's true, we could probably do that.  I'll wait for other devs to comment first, though.

[09:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If everyone agrees with me, not much point in doing the work.

[09:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What I was thinking of doing is trying to get some POC RDF output, in a separate data stream, to discourage people from thinking about using RDFa/microdata for "Augustus is an emperor" type info.

[09:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah. I don't think that ability will matter in practice. Just thought it was a way to sway those who are sitting on the fence

[09:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It goes both ways, though.

[09:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
is POC = Proof Of Concept?

[09:14:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah.

[09:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, data URIs could be used instead of doc="". Though, doc does help to reduce the amount of required boilerplate.  <iframe src="data:text/html-sandboxed,<!DOCTYPE html><p>test"></iframe>

[09:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, the consensus in #mediawiki seems to be "avoid flamewars by disabling it for now".

[09:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unsurprisingly.

[09:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I said that in the earlier discussion, having both specs on standards tracks will make authors reluctant to use either.

[09:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, that technique would also allow easy server-side detection by checking the Accept header when generating the page. If Accept contains text/html-sandboxed, output data URI. Otherwise, output nothing or HTTP URI to server side alternative.

[09:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: I don't think adding another 20 bytes to every web request in the entire world is a good idea, for a feature approximately nobody will use

[10:05:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me wonders if there are bots these days scraping html content of wikipedia or if they all start from wiki markup.

[10:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>

[10:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least on my screen, the little w3c logo ends up looking pretty pixellated and ugly on all the pictures.

[10:38:00.0000] <karlcow>
hmm I'm lost by the last TabAtkins message :)

[10:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sorry, commenting on Dashiva's link.

[10:39:00.0000] <karlcow>
I thought that hsivonen said the hidden attribute was removing things from the DOM, and AryehGregor that user agents should ignore the content of this part. I guess I have to read the thread again.

[10:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
UAs should indeed ignore it when rendering.  If hsivonen said it was removing things from the DOM, he's either mistaken or misspoke.

[10:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/editing.html#the-hidden-attribute

[10:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The spec makes it pretty clear that it's just a rendering issue.

[10:41:01.0000] <karlcow>
more chances that I misinterpret him, which makes my questions, my comments out of scope.

[10:41:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The important bit is that it applies to *all* possible user interaction modes, so it's not just a visual hiding.

[10:42:00.0000] <karlcow>
>Elements in a section hidden by the hidden attribute are still active, e.g. scripts and form controls in such sections still execute and submit respectively. Only their presentation to the user changes.

[10:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Not remove it from the DOM, but treat that subtree as if it wasn't there

[10:42:02.0000] <karlcow>
:) my questions are moot then! 

[10:43:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me *sighs* about himself

[10:43:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: I think that's still a very unclear way of stating it.  The subtree is certainly still there for, say, scripts.

[10:43:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's merely a matter of getting the equivalent of display:none for all interaction mediums.

[10:43:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
(though display:none is already forced to be equivalent to @hidden, since it is used for this purpose so often.)

[10:43:04.0000] <karlcow>
At least, it seems there is misunderstanding by people. Hmmm I wonder what would be a better way to reformulate it

[10:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me considers questioning whether the flaws in localStorage and autobuffer would have been noticed if there had been no implementations, decides not to bother

[10:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think it's valid to point out, jgraham.  Before implementation only browser authors and spec readers can find problems.  After implementation early-adopter users can start looking for problems, and they're actually putting it to use rather than just imagining what might theoretically be a problem.

[10:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
They're the beta testers for specs.  I don't think there's a single sane developer alive who thinks that beta testers are not an absolute requirement for good software.

[10:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You could make an analogy to open source and closed source

[10:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The more people playing with a feature, the better it gets tested

[10:47:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Enough eyes, shallow bugs, etc.

[10:47:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, enough hands :)

[10:47:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Interaction medium racist!  Eyes are just hands for the visual!

[10:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
All kinds of things seem reasonable in theory, but when you try to use it there's this nasty reality thing getting in the way 

[10:48:01.0000] <jgraham>
Oh I have no doubt it is a valid thing to point out. I'm just not convinced there is any point to increasing the volume of email to point out something that is basically unchangable anyway

[10:48:02.0000] <karlcow>
somehow more than hidden attribute, it has a notion of "camouflage", "undercover", "conceal" with the benefit of less spelling mistake because of the double d

[10:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, Boris is making a mistake in lamenting localStorage's implementation.  We wouldn't have known it was a problem before implementation.

[10:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't care about correcting some of the more trollish people, but we should make sure that the browser authors are on the right page.  ^_^

[10:49:02.0000] <jgraham>
Oh OK then. But it is your own fault that I am filling up your inbox :)

[10:49:03.0000] <Dashiva>
It would probably be better to point it out now, rather than have someone else use it as a flawed argument later

[10:49:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: One more email won't matter to the torrent.

[10:50:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: That probably won't stop someone, but still.  I'd rather that *Boris* not end up using it as a flawed argument later.

[10:51:00.0000] <karlcow>
TabAtkins: experimental implementation vs mainstream implementation. An alpha release could be used to test things, but should not go into the mainstream until it is really tested.

[10:52:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
"Really tested", though, doesn't really happen until you get a lot of users.  That's the difference between an alpha and a beta.

[10:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also, the web doesn't really have a distinction between alpha, beta, and public.  The best you can do is keep it in nightlies and not release it to the public build.

[10:53:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Spec writers and early adopters are not very representative of the average user either

[10:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Topic change: I think my interview with Google went extremely well!  I'll find out something next week, but I'm pretty hopeful.

[10:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Which office?

[10:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Googleplex.  I'd be doing Hixie's job, but for CSS.

[10:58:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Cool

[10:58:01.0000] <Dashiva>
CSSOM too?

[11:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, that's under the remit of the CSSWG, so possibly.  I could certainly help Anne out.

[11:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
karlcow: The @autobuffer thing is a really good example. Lots of people in specs land knew exactly how that attribute worked and could have suggested the change at any time if they had realised the design was flawed. But it was not until someone tried to use it in production that the flaw became obvious

[11:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
And I doubt that person would ever have read the spec if it couldn't be used

[11:09:00.0000] <webben>
The way I tend to talk about "hidden" is to discuss it in terms of interface state.

[11:10:00.0000] <karlcow>
webben: yes for me, it is like a mask.

[11:10:01.0000] <webben>
effectively "hidden" demarks subtrees that are not presented in the current interface state.

[11:10:02.0000] <webben>
I'm not sure what a mask would be in this context.

[11:10:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I find it easier to just say "What display:none does for visual browsers, @hidden does for all possible browsers, including screen-readers and such."

[11:11:00.0000] <karlcow>
take a cardboard, cut a hole (then the mask), move the cardboard along the page, you have access to some part of the text.

[11:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
transparent :)

[11:11:02.0000] <webben>
TabAtkins: That's problematic, because display:none applies to multiple media and will typically, but not hide content from popular screen readers too.

[11:12:00.0000] <webben>
*but not always,

[11:12:01.0000] <webben>
otoh the fact that people are already using display: none; for this does suggest that they will use "hidden" vaguely correctly at least some of the time.

[11:12:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's technically true, but the average author only pays attention to visual media, and thus naturally only thinks about display:none hiding things visually.

[11:13:00.0000] <webben>
Yeah, I more mean, explaining it that way is likely to increase misuse of display: none; among those who think it only affects sighted users.

[11:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which leads to problems when they try to visually hide something with display:none, but ATs have realized that to present the web compatibly they need to ignore display:none content as well.

[11:13:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, gotcha.  Well, screen-readers use media=screen anyway.

[11:14:00.0000] <webben>
I know. But that doesn't help.

[11:14:01.0000] <webben>
i.e. if authors get the impression: use display: none; to hide things visually; and hidden to remove things from current interface state

[11:15:00.0000] <webben>
then things they mean to show to AT but not to sighted users will probably get hidden from both.

[11:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's happening right now, though, for any author that doesn't realize that ATs pay attention to display:none.

[11:15:02.0000] <webben>
Oh absolutely.

[11:16:00.0000] <webben>
I'm just saying explaining hidden with your example language exacerbates that situation.

[11:16:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ok, granted.  But it's still simpler than talking about interface states.  ^_^

[11:16:02.0000] <webben>
if anyone can come up with simpler language that is as precise, I'd prefer to adopt it.

[11:17:00.0000] <webben>
(I've had some success managing to explain the principal that the DOM contains one interface state to people in IRC, so it's not utterly useless as language.)

[11:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just use my language with a parenthetical after it describing the actual situation with display:none on the ground.

[11:17:02.0000] <webben>
*principle

[11:18:00.0000] <webben>
maybe what this situation needs is a flowchart ;)

[11:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Alternately, use the relatively well-known practice of position:absolute;left:-9001px;, which *is* a purely visual matter so far.

[11:18:02.0000] <Dashiva>
If the user knows about @media: GOTO A

[11:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Topic change: You know those logic puzzles you got back in school, where Mr Green lives in a brown house and drinks beer, while the person in the red house drinks wine, and so on?  And you have to figure out all the bits?  I run into these stupid things often enough that I think I want to put together an automatic chart-maker in javascript.

[11:20:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Wouldn't it be more natural to use prolog or something?

[11:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm struggling through a 5-axis one right now.

[11:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but I want a nice interface.

[11:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Like on the worksheets I got back in school.

[11:21:03.0000] <webben>
maybe you could build a UI on top of prolog?

[11:21:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hah.

[11:21:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, you don't want it to solve it for you, just make the chart for you to solve it with?

[11:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: Yeah.  Automatic solving is no fun.

[11:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's generally a pretty trivial constraint-solving, which wouldn't be hard to program.

[11:22:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But I like the experience of working through the worksheet and ticking off the boxes.

[11:22:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's just drawing all the boxes that gets tiresome.

[11:22:04.0000] <Dashiva>
I've been thinking about making an assisted solver

[11:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
One that only ticks boxes that are trivially true

[11:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
So you get to do the fun stuff, but when it's just fill-in-the-rest at the end, it handles that for you :)

[11:23:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh.

[11:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I'd probably have it do that too.  When you end up with all-but-one on a row crossed out, it would automatically check that one and do all the other cross-outs.

[11:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The problem is that I want to spend today playing video games, not programming.

[11:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Spend the day programming video games

[11:26:01.0000] <webben>
Solved!

[11:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
^_^

[12:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, good luck at Google!

[12:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thanks!

[12:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, when were the localStorage problems actually figured out, and by who?  autobuffer was by authors after implementation, I know that.

[12:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd have to trawl my archives to find out.

[12:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
How did you wind up applying to Google?

[12:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, ^^

[12:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, sorry Aryeh.

[12:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was trawling for spec-writing jobs at TPAC, and Hixie asked for my resume after hearing me bug Anne about possibilities at Opera.

[12:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Neat.

[12:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: I think ALTERNATE-STYLESHEET is uppercase so that it can't ever conflict with an actual rel value

[12:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
i.e. you can't generate it with rel="ALTERNATE-STYLESHEET" (because values get lowercased)

[12:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
so it uniquely identifies the fact that there's both "alternate" and "stylesheet" tokens

[12:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i like the thread where people say html5 hasn't received enough review because it's changing (in response to review comments) too quickly

[12:48:00.0000] <cardona507>
Good luck at google TabAtkins

[12:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Every change they don't like is due to your caprice and inconsistency, Hixie.

[12:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thanks, cardona507.

[12:51:00.0000] <jcranmer>
are there any defacto standards for indicating syntax-highlighted code?

[12:51:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
For marking it up?  Or for indicating that some code happens to be syntax-highlighted?

[12:51:02.0000] <jcranmer>
<code class="???">int</code>, for example

[12:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You can look at any particular language that does html-based syntax highlighting.  PHP has a function for that, frex.

[12:55:00.0000] <jcranmer>
that does <font color="#....">

[12:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
True.  http://www.metalgeek.com/archives/2004/03/30/000018.php is a tool that changes that back into better HTML.

[12:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Using a small set of classes.

[12:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
.default, .html, .comment, .keyword, .string

[12:58:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I see about three different schemes:

[12:58:01.0000] <jcranmer>
.html, .comment, etc.

[12:58:02.0000] <jcranmer>
[ruby does it, and appears some other people use that]

[12:59:00.0000] <jcranmer>
media wiki has some .kw0 stuff, etc.

[13:00:00.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: oh, I missed the step where the tokens were lowercased (because I didn't actually implement that part)

[13:00:01.0000] <jcranmer>
I see some .c, .i, .d, .v in another output

[13:03:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I'll go with the .keyword-esque stuff

[13:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
jcranmer, MediaWiki typically uses GeSHi.

[14:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
does anyone here know if someone has volunteered to write a counter proposal for the longdesc issue yet?

[15:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does <meta> cause weird compatibility issues, with Microdata, or does it end up being safe?

[15:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
what sort of compatibility issues?

[15:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
Firefox without the HTML5 parser enabled inserts the meta element to the head, regardless of where it appears in the markup, so I guess you could consider that a minor compat issue

[15:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But I guess it has no effect anyway, so it makes no difference.

[15:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is considering whether to whitelist it for MW microdata.

[15:54:01.0000] <Lachy>
it would only affect scripts if they were looking for the meta element in the specific place

[15:54:02.0000] <foolip>
I sent feedback on <meta>/<link> in microdata a long while ago

[15:54:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
What was your feedback?

[15:54:04.0000] <foolip>
<meta> is a problem, it breaks script implementation in for example firefox

[15:54:05.0000] <foolip>
/me looks for link

[15:55:00.0000] <foolip>
http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-November/024116.html

[15:55:01.0000] <foolip>
I would suggest using <span hidden> intead of <meta>

[15:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
Same problem in WebKit too

[15:56:01.0000] <foolip>
<link> seems OK, but still I'd probably use <a hidden> instead

[15:56:02.0000] <foolip>
hidden metadata will be ugly, is the conclusion

[15:56:03.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, so that explains why your response to Toby's recent profile proposal used <span hidden> instead of meta. I was wondering about that.

[15:57:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: right, I have gotten into that habit

[15:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
<span hidden> has worse legacy fallback, surely.

[15:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
not with: [hidden] { display: none; }

[15:58:01.0000] <foolip>
are there browsers where what Lachy said doesn't work?

[15:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
IE < 8

[15:58:03.0000] <foolip>
ouch

[15:58:04.0000] <Lachy>
can't remember if IE7 supported attr selectors or not

[15:58:05.0000] <Lachy>
IE6 didn't

[15:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE7 did, I think, can't recall.

[15:59:01.0000] <foolip>
that's a big problem then, is @hidden going to be usable in the forseable future?


2010-01-18
[16:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
hidden metadata should generally be avoided anyway, so I wouldn't call it a show stopper

[16:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
the other alternative might be to use <meta ... itemref="x">

[16:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
that way, at least the association isn't lost by the DOM being incorrect

[16:01:02.0000] <foolip>
<meta id="x"> ... <div itemscope itemref="x"> rather, but yes

[16:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, yeah. that's what I meant

[16:02:01.0000] <foolip>
/me hasn't decided what to make of the "can't create cycles of blank nodes" limitation yet

[16:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me goes back to furiously scratching his broken arm. It's only been a day and a half, and this cast is already getting unbearable.

[16:05:00.0000] <foolip>
what happened to your arm anyway?

[16:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
broke it while playing Snakes and Ladders (or, as Americans apparently know it, Shoots and Ladders)

[16:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
er, that's probably Chutes and Laddres

[16:06:01.0000] <foolip>
I don't know what either is, but OK

[16:06:02.0000] <Lachy>
it's a board game

[16:06:03.0000] <foolip>
heh?

[16:06:04.0000] <foolip>
were you drunk?

[16:06:05.0000] <Lachy>
yes. A little. Considering that we had turned it into an awesome drinking game

[16:07:00.0000] <cardona507>
haha

[16:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
The rules were simple. If you climb a ladder, everyone else drinks. If you go down a snake, you drink. If you roll a 1, the the person to the left drinks. If a 6, then person to the right drinks.

[16:07:02.0000] <cardona507>
I hope it heals up Lachy 

[16:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
The dice rule was particularly nasty because the dice was very wonky, and landed on 1 or 6 most of the time

[16:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, since it's customary here to wear socks inside when you're a guest at someone's place (even though I hate wearing socks inside), I was wearing socks on a slippery wooden floor.

[16:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
I then slipped over as I was coming back with the bottle of wine

[16:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
wacked my left elbow on the floor quite hard

[16:10:02.0000] <foolip>
was any of this caught on camera?

[16:10:03.0000] <Lachy>
no, unfortunately

[16:10:04.0000] <foolip>
unfortunate indeed :)

[16:10:05.0000] <cardona507>
broken elbow?

[16:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
and the other 3 who were there also didn't see me fall. They looked up when I started screaming

[16:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[16:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
smaug, now what do I do to get this checked in?  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=535043

[16:12:00.0000] <cardona507>
right/left?

[16:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
But I didn't know it was broken till yesterday, even though it happened a week ago. I was sure I had just bruised it, but decided to get it checked after it didn't heal.

[16:12:02.0000] <Lachy>
I said Left

[16:12:03.0000] <cardona507>
ahhh - I see above now ^

[16:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
the only problem is that this kinda ruined my plans to go skiing this weekend :-(

[16:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Over here some people make you take off your shoes when you visit, but those people are jerks.

[16:27:00.0000] <foolip>
who wears shoes inside anyway?

[16:28:00.0000] <cardona507>
you know what I always say http://www.surfartposters.com/wp-content/images/surf-posters-SF50.jpg :)

[16:28:01.0000] <cardona507>
I lived on Kauai for 6 years and there is so much mud it really helps to kick off the shoes at the door

where is the API that javascript uses to access the canvas?

[19:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You mean: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#canvasrenderingcontext2d

[19:40:00.0000] <vices>
nice

[19:41:00.0000] <vices>
is that javascript or c++ ?

[19:42:00.0000] <vices>
okay forget that question, how can I write an API for another language besides javascript?

[19:42:01.0000] <vices>
^^

[20:02:00.0000] <vices>
or.. where can I see the javascript source that implements the canvas functions?

[20:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
vices: You can read the source for Firefox or Webkit to see the C (or C++?  I forget) that underlies the javascript implementation.

[20:16:00.0000] <vices>
nice!

[20:16:01.0000] <vices>
where is that?

[20:16:02.0000] <vices>
;)

[20:19:00.0000] <jcranmer>
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/canvas/ is for Firefox

[20:20:00.0000] <vices>
jcranmer: sweet, thank you sir

[22:20:00.0000] <jgornick>
Hey guys, quick question.  With the HTML5 spec, you can use both strict and non-strict tags right?  Much like <br /> or <br> ?

[22:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgornick: they're both strict tags now

[22:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
jgornick: they mean the same thing -- the "/" is ignored but allowed for people who prefer the XML style

[22:34:02.0000] <jgornick>
Hixie, Great, thanks!

[22:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
np

[23:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there any way in RDF, given a blank node with various triples having it as the subject, to add a triple that gives the blank node an identifier?

[23:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. is there a way, given (_a, X, 1), (_a, Y, 2), (_a, Z, 3), to add some triple(s) that says that _a === A?

[23:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
or is the only way to go ahead and change all the triples to just use A instead of refering to the blank node?

[23:23:00.0000] <deltab>
Hixie: _a = A, or  _a <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs> A

[23:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah, thanks

[23:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
so the predicate http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs is some sort of RDF internal magic predicate?

[23:26:00.0000] <deltab>
hmm, I don't know if you can call it 'internal' or 'magic', but it does have the  =  shortcut in Notation3: http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html

[23:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there any way in RDF to say "any blank node that is the subject of a triple with the predicate B and object C is also the subject of a triple with the predicate X and the object X"?

[23:27:01.0000] <deltab>
sure, it can be used to change how triples are processed; but so could knowing that x is transitive in  a x b; b x c

[23:29:00.0000] <deltab>
that'd be an implication, I guess

[23:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm trying to work out whether i can write http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#conversion-to-rdf by just giving some RDF that people can just load up and have it Just Work

[23:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
instead of (as now) requiring that they add extra magic to their code

[23:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 can use the #sameAs thing

[23:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
but 1 seems harder

[23:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me looks into the itemref="" loop issue

[00:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
you know you're making a mistake when you start writing "x is true if the following algorithm does not terminate:"

[00:05:01.0000] <Dashiva>
<div id="a" itemref="a"

[00:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
itemscope itemprop=x></div>

[00:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
<div id=a itemscope itemprop=x><div itemscope itemprop=y itemref=a></div></div>

[00:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
my favourite case is  <div itemscope itemref="a"></div> <div itemprop="p" itemscope id="a" itemref="b"></div> <div itemprop="q" itemscope id="b" itemref="a"></div>

[00:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
A Q graph

[00:19:00.0000] <foolip>
oh yay, itemref loops

[00:22:00.0000] <danbri>
itemref loops?

[00:23:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: I don't think Manu has been spreading more "misinformation" about microdata than "we" have about RDFa. all misunderstandings in good faith as far as I can see

[00:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I have trouble taking talk about microdata's being unstable in good faith when RDFa 1.1 is planning incompatible changes for an ecosystem that already ignores versioning

[00:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how i ended up having mark_a_morgan blocked on twitter

[00:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
is there some way to find out who you have blocked on twitter?

[00:27:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: owl:sameAs if for individuals, I think equivalent predicates should use owl:equivalentProperty (why OWL has several concepts of sameness I don't know)

[00:28:00.0000] <foolip>
where "individuals" is nodes in the graph I guess, as opposed to the relations between them

[00:33:00.0000] <danbri>
you use owl:sameAs when there really is just one thing you're talking about; ie. it's a strong claim

[00:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
so is there some way to recast http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#conversion-to-rdf into pure RDF (no prose), and have it mean the same thing?

[00:33:02.0000] <danbri>
it's a way of dealing with situations where there are multiple URIs that are really just names for same thing; or mentions of same thing that don't use URIs

[00:34:00.0000] <danbri>
/me reads

[00:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
paragraph 1 being the hard one

[00:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
2, 3, and 4 could just be straight-forward sameAs statements

[00:35:01.0000] <danbri>
i was about to say, ...

[00:35:02.0000] <danbri>
1st one is the hard one ;) not sure what you're doing there exactly

[00:35:03.0000] <danbri>
and the last three, I'd suggest owl:equivalentProperty rather than owl:sameAs

[00:37:00.0000] <danbri>
owl:sameAs would mean that everything true of the former is true of the latter; this makes it hard to keep admin metadata, eg. html5:author might have a different properties to ccrel:attributionName (eg. their textual labels, translations etc.)

[00:38:00.0000] <foolip>
as long as you can dump it into a triplestore and make queries using ccrel:attributionName all is well

[00:38:01.0000] <danbri>
why are the initial urls so odd (ie. embedding / escaping other urls?)

[00:39:00.0000] <danbri>
foolip, well you have to watch out for other queries that might give bogus results, eg. if you asked for all properties that had been made by the Creative Commons, you should only find the CC ones, not the whatwg/html5 ones...

[00:39:01.0000] <danbri>
owl:equivalentProperty will work there; owl:sameAs will muddle things up

[00:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
the first one is trying to take the pattern  "_ foo X" for a particular value of "foo" and make _ be X

[00:39:03.0000] <foolip>
owl:sameAs seems inappropriate from my reading of it, yes

[00:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i could say that "foo" is sameAs sameAs

[00:40:00.0000] <danbri>
the first one is sameAs, yeah

[00:40:01.0000] <danbri>
identity reasoning is a pain in the butt, but unavoidable without a URI God to compel everyone to use exactly same URIs for everything

[00:41:00.0000] <foolip>
but how to you capture the condition that if (bla) then x sameAs y ?

[00:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
(still responding to scrollback) i don't understand why sameAs is wrong for the other three. I want to make them exactly identical, so that it's like nobody ever used the one in the spec, and the other one is used everywhere

[00:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
the URLs are odd because they're the result of converting the short names used in microdata to the URL form used in RDF

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh, i understand the owl:equivalentProperty thing now

[00:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[00:42:02.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: is the appending of # and : inspired by some RDFy scheme?

[00:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
no

[00:42:04.0000] <foolip>
I'll just let you reply to that email so everyone can see the answer :)

[00:42:05.0000] <Hixie>
it's needed to make it impossible to end up with the URLs in another way

[00:42:06.0000] <Hixie>
(i forget the details)

[00:43:00.0000] <danbri>
hixie, if you make them exactly identical, then all properties of the latter become properties of the former; eg. re dc:title

[00:43:01.0000] <danbri>
<rdf:Property rdf:about="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title">

[00:43:02.0000] <danbri>
<rdfs:label xml:lang="en-US">Title</rdfs:label>

[00:43:03.0000] <danbri>
<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-US">A name given to the resource.</rdfs:comment>

[00:43:04.0000] <danbri>

[00:43:09.0000] <danbri>
<skos:note xml:lang="en-US">A second property with the same name as this property has been declared in the dcterms: namespace (http://purl.org/dc/terms/).  See the Introduction to the document "DCMI Metadata Terms" (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/) for an explanation.</skos:note>

[00:43:10.0000] <danbri>
</rdf:Property>

[00:44:00.0000] <danbri>
... all that from the dc namespace would also be asserted for http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/microdata#http%3A%2F%2Fn.whatwg.org%2Fwork%23%3Atitle

[00:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[00:44:02.0000] <danbri>
... and people running queries like 'find me property URIs from Dublin Core issued before 2000' would find your URIs; while we could find wiggleroom to justify this, it would cause general confusion I'm sure

[00:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
so presumably i also want equivalentProperty sameAs for the other one, not sameAs sameAs?

[00:44:04.0000] <foolip>
reading RDF/XML is such a thrill

[00:45:00.0000] <danbri>
yes please

[00:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[00:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'll dump this in when i'm done fixing the itemref issue

[00:45:03.0000] <danbri>
and yes, owl:sameAs is over-used a bit. The linked data crowd liked the name but sometimes assert it between similar things...

[00:45:04.0000] <danbri>
oh btw -

[00:46:00.0000] <danbri>
I started drafting towards an rdfa tutorial. it is far from done, idea was to try to explain basic processing / structuring model without mentioning markup too much

[00:46:01.0000] <danbri>
perhaps it would work for microdata too? I haven't studied detailed diffs between the two

[00:46:02.0000] <danbri>
-> http://wiki.foaf-project.org/w/RDFaTutorial

[00:47:00.0000] <danbri>
i'd like to cut it down to a page that gave the basic idea: that each point in the doc can be 'about' something (= itemscope in your terms?)

[00:47:01.0000] <danbri>
and that the attributes either change the focus/scope, or give properties and relationships ... 

[00:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think rdfa and microdata are different enough that readers would be better off not trying to learn both at once

[00:48:01.0000] <foolip>
we should add <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/microdata#http%3A%2F%2Fmicroformats.org%2Fprofile%2Fhcard%23%3Afn> owl:equivalentProperty foaf:name and a bunch of other triples to make hcard data more useable to RDF processors

[00:48:02.0000] <danbri>
Hixie, perhaps not learn both syntaxes at once, but learn what they have in common?

[00:49:00.0000] <danbri>
/me always reminded of http://s173.photobucket.com/albums/w57/spn_imgs/?action=view&current=blahblah.jpg&newest=1 - old larson cartoon 

[00:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: i'd rather just make it equivalent to an existing vCard RDF vocabulary, and let the RDF guys worry about how that matches FOAF

[00:49:02.0000] <danbri>
the existing vCard RDFs are in flux ... the 90s one is pretty broken and a new one is 'in the works'

[00:49:03.0000] <foolip>
oh, I didn't know there was a vCard RDF vocab, that sounds better though

[00:50:00.0000] <danbri>
you could add both harmlessly enough

[00:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: fundamentally RDFa and microdata present the same underlying triple idea in very different ways

[00:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: e.g. in microdata the presentation is more about groups of name-value pairs, where values can be further groups, or strings, or urls (or dates/times)

[00:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: whereas in RDFa the presentation is more about graphs

[00:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: of URLs

[00:52:00.0000] <foolip>
"It provides a simplified version of the basic factual claims that a page makes, stripped of flashy colours, pretty pictures or seductive language." <- surely one can express lies just as well in RDF as in natural language?

[00:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: in particular, with itemref="" in microdata you can even declare a bunch of name-value pairs without saying what group they're part of, and multiple groups (itemscope="" items) can import in those name-value pairs

[00:53:00.0000] <danbri>
interesting, do you have an example of where that's useful?

[00:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not really useful for multiple items to use the same properties per se, but the use case for it is the same as the use case in RDFa for having about="" listed in several places

[00:54:01.0000] <danbri>
sounds like a kind of inheritance mechanism (but scoped to a single document I guess?)

[00:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
with the same value

[00:54:03.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: that last part about sharing subtrees between several items seems dubious though, certainly it means the model isn't a tree any longer but a directed graph (I think)

[00:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. see http://damowmow.com/playground/microdata/004/review-annotated.html

[00:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: depends what you consider the nodes

[00:55:02.0000] <foolip>
if you can fix itemref loops without breaking that though, fine

[00:55:03.0000] <foolip>
I did break it in my solution

[00:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: (except, if you look at that solution, pretend that <itemref> is really an itemref="" attribute next to the itemscope="" attribute)

[00:57:00.0000] <danbri>
/me not quite seeing the difference

[00:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
as what?

[00:58:00.0000] <danbri>
ah maybe i misunderstood your 'can import in those name-value pairs'

[00:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
here's another way of showing the difference

[00:58:02.0000] <danbri>
they're linked by a named property/relationship, not copied directly in?

[00:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
in microdata, if you say <div itemscope itemtype=... itemid=X></div><div itemscope itemtype=... itemid=X></div>, there are two empty groups of name-value pairs with no properties

[00:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
in RDFa, if you say <div about="X"></div><div about="X"></div>, there is no data present.

[00:59:01.0000] <danbri>
(folip, yes, it's important to be able to lie ... I was trying to capture that these property/value language strip out a lot of the human richness from docs, to dumb them down to computer level)

[00:59:02.0000] <danbri>
/me nods

[01:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
now it happens that microdata has a (lossy) mapping to RDF, and RDF has a (lossy, implied) mapping to microdata, but it's not the point of the mechanism

[01:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
unlike RDFa where the conversion to RDF is lossless and is the point of the mechanism

[01:01:01.0000] <danbri>
what's lost when you go from microdata to rdf?

[01:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can't refer to something with no properties in a triple store

[01:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
there's no triple

[01:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
you also lose the untyped items

[01:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
and currently you lose some type information from <time> elements, though that could be fixed

[01:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
my three legged cat is climbing on top of my bike

[01:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
this could go very poorly

[01:04:02.0000] <danbri>
hmm, I could say that http://danbri.org/foaf.rdf#danbri is a foaf:Person ...

[01:04:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, he'll never reach the pedals

[01:04:04.0000] <Hixie>
she's now sitting on the seat

[01:04:05.0000] <danbri>
and that it has a http://example.com/fooprop of http://example.org/barvalue

[01:04:06.0000] <danbri>
and say nothing more about barvalue

[01:05:00.0000] <danbri>
is that what you mean by a thinkg with no properties? do you count "incoming" properties as its properties?

[01:05:01.0000] <danbri>
since often the naming/direction of a property is pretty arbitrary

[01:05:02.0000] <danbri>
'made' vs 'maker' etc

[01:06:00.0000] <danbri>
/me grins re cat

[01:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok, back. sorry, had to take a picture of the cat doing this or my girlfriend would never believe me.

[01:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: consider <div itemscope></div> -- it's an item, but it has no type, no properties, and no identifier.

[01:07:01.0000] <danbri>
/me looks for a numLegs property in http://hyperdata.org/xmlns/pets/hedwig.xml ... fails

[01:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: it can exist in microdata (the DOM API can reference it), but I can't see how it can exist in RDF.

[01:08:01.0000] <danbri>
ok, it's a placeholder piece of markup?

[01:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
could be, yeah

[01:08:03.0000] <danbri>
oh, got you

[01:09:00.0000] <danbri>
so i guess if we distinguish APIs to the markup, from APIs to 'what the markup tells us', we get both

[01:09:01.0000] <danbri>
RDF APIs won't tell you the grouping clusters that things came in, in their source graphs

[01:09:02.0000] <danbri>
they tend to take pride in protecting people from needing to care about that 

[01:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[01:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
i don't think this is a failure of either model

[01:09:05.0000] <danbri>
but markup APIs obviously need that too, eg. to make an editor

[01:09:06.0000] <danbri>
/me neither

[01:09:07.0000] <Hixie>
but it's a difference

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
in most practical applications, these differences would likely not come up much -- you don't exactly need to express an empty item often

[01:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, this is one of the examples of the reason i think it's best not to try to explain microdata and RDFa models together

[01:11:00.0000] <danbri>
so this is more a difference between the packet of deliverables the RDFa project and the Microformats project give you; former gives you markup, triples model, and maybe eventually an API to the triples; latter gives you markup, triples model, and an API to the markup 

[01:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think it might confuse people more than help, as they might try to apply one model to the other, and get confused

[01:12:00.0000] <danbri>
so, in both models, we are saying ... that any bit of markup can be scoped to be 'about' some specific thing of interest; and we might or might not identify that thing specifically. but regardless, it is a grouping construct for a collection of properties/links that describe it.

[01:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
do you mean "microformats" there or "microdata"?

[01:12:02.0000] <danbri>
yeah sorry

[01:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[01:13:01.0000] <danbri>
mini-info, tiny-factoids, etc :)

[01:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
i wouldn't really say microdata is a triples model

[01:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's more a nestable name-value pair list model

[01:13:04.0000] <danbri>
but it does (perhaps grudgingly) give you the triples

[01:13:05.0000] <Hixie>
it can be converted to triples, yeah

[01:13:06.0000] <danbri>
so is any rdf syntax

[01:13:07.0000] <Hixie>
like rdf can be converted to name-value lists

[01:13:08.0000] <Hixie>
but it's not a perfect translation

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. you can't express an empty list as triples sanely

[01:14:01.0000] <danbri>
people didn't make RDF 'cos they loved triples; they made it cos they wanted to get a big pile of name-value metadata systems talking to each other

[01:14:02.0000] <danbri>
yup, that's the syntax / model distinction again

[01:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
also, re your "in both models" statement above, it's possible to make name-value pairs in microdata without scoping it to a subject (item):

[01:15:01.0000] <danbri>
in RDF too, kinda

[01:15:02.0000] <danbri>
I can write:

[01:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. <div itemscope itemtype=... itemid=A itemref="q r"></div> <div id=q itemprop=Q>...</div> <div id=r itemprop=R>...</div> -- q and r could be referenced from other items also

[01:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
so they're not scoped to A

[01:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
(actually that's the case even if they _are_ scoped to A)

[01:16:03.0000] <danbri>
<rdf:Description><owner><Person><name>Ian Hixon</name></Person></owner><numLegs>3</numLegs></rdf:Description> ....

[01:16:04.0000] <danbri>
... ie. 'there is something, ... owned by hixie, ... with 3 legs'

[01:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
in the microdata example above, id=q doesn't say "there is something with Q=...", it only says "Q=..."

[01:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
if nothing references it, then nothing has Q=...

[01:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
(and there's a conformance error, but that's another problem)

[01:17:03.0000] <danbri>
and you're finding that construct useful?

[01:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
it proved to be a less confusing way of allowing properties of a single item to be scattered across a document than having each one be scoped to an item and for all those items to share the said itemid

[01:19:00.0000] <danbri>
but in that case they are properties of some item?

[01:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[01:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
the one(s) that referenced them

[01:19:03.0000] <danbri>
(or item means the grouping construct, not the thing described?)

[01:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
item means the thing with itemscope=""

[01:19:05.0000] <Hixie>
the list of name-value pairs

[01:20:00.0000] <danbri>
beginning to think we need a testcase repository

[01:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. you can do <div itemscope itemref="a b"></div> ...blabla... <meta itemprop=a content="1"> ...blabla... <link itemprop=b href="2">

[01:20:02.0000] <danbri>
irc is a bit cramped for this sort of detailed comparison

[01:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
with the RDFa-style you would do just ..blabla... <meta about=X rel=a content="1"> ...blabla... <link about=X rel=b href="2">

[01:21:01.0000] <danbri>
for rdf/xml we used http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/ ... basically a collection of rdf/xml documents plus normalised triples extracted, and some working-group metadata

[01:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
(but when we did the usability tests we found people got far more confused by that than the itemref thing)

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
(even though it seems simpler)

[01:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
(it is also harder to expose in the DOM, since there's no longer a single element that maps to an item)

[01:22:02.0000] <danbri>
i'm confused by both here! using real examples rather than 'a', 'q', 'foo' etc helps, esp as i don't know your syntax well

[01:23:00.0000] <danbri>
care to bash a full example into a wiki somewhere?

[01:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
both are intending to express the triples X,a,1 and X,b,2

[01:23:02.0000] <danbri>
...and the human prose wrapped around those two triples is in same bit of the doc, or different bits of the doc? 

[01:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
different

[01:24:01.0000] <danbri>
(how do i get an url to this conversation btw? there's a logger bot with #-offsets somehow?)

[01:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
see /topic

[01:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: were you aware of IE running <script defer> specified in innerHTML when you specced defer?

[01:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
!

[01:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
no

[01:26:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=539812#c1

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess that partilly explains sicking's findings of defer execution in IE being sensitive to whether innerHTML setter is also used

[01:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess so

[01:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have no intention of duplicating that

[01:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
far too much depends on innerHTML not running code

[01:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
i am very surprised to hear of this

[01:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I am, too

[01:31:00.0000] <smaug>

foolip: I think manu was overstating the Process status of RDFa and Aryeh was overstating the Process status of Microdata on the mediawiki list

[01:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: making children point to parent by id would fix the loop issue

[01:40:01.0000] <danbri>
/me waves from a shiny new limechat ... same /topic display problem

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: come again?

[01:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
Freenode seems really quite broken

[01:41:02.0000] <danbri>
hixie, can i click yet?

[01:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Worst case is O(n^2), I think, if you have particularly carefully-chosen input

[01:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: sure

[01:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: if instead of itemref pointing from parent to child you have an attribute for reparenting a child, the structure is guaranteed to be a tree

[01:42:03.0000] <Philip`>
because the error-correcting algorithm can generate that many nodes

[01:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: we tried that

[01:42:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it didn't fare well in usability testing

[01:42:06.0000] <Philip`>
though implementations could apply some limit to prevent that growing forever

[01:42:07.0000] <Hixie>
(that's what we had initially -- itemfor="")

[01:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Also implementations can have O(n^2) string concatenation cost unless they're very careful

[01:43:01.0000] <danbri>
ok http://damowmow.com/temp/a.txt makes a big diff with rdfa syntax clear

[01:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: there's an attack going on in #webkit

[01:43:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I guess usability doesn't need to be sensible when it comes to the coherence of the data structures

[01:43:04.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: (For typical input it should be O(n), I believe)

[01:44:00.0000] <danbri>
the licensing name/value pair gets attached to all the things mentioned in the earlier items ... that suprised me

[01:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Oh, right

[01:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me parts that channel

[01:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah taht was my solution too

[01:44:04.0000] <danbri>
not saying it's good-bad-wrong-right, ... just didn't realise microdata did that

[01:44:05.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: it's itemref="" doing that

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's a bit like a #include

[01:45:01.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Also, the PHP implementation is very different from the python one (I only really know about the python one)

[01:45:02.0000] <danbri>
ah sorry, didn't see that attribute

[01:45:03.0000] <danbri>
thought it was some defaulting mechanism

[01:46:00.0000] <danbri>
id="licenses" is a bit like what we call 'bnode identifiers' ... things that don't play a role in real URIs but just serve to group things together within some document context

[01:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
id="" is just a regular HTML id attribute

[01:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
not part of microdata per se, except as a way for itemref="" to identify another element

[01:59:00.0000] <danbri>
hixie, thanks for the microdata  chat. heading off now, but i think i learned a bit more about how you're thinking at least...

[01:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
cool

[01:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to come discuss it more :-)

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
your feedback is very welcome

[02:13:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: http://damowmow.com/temp/a.txt was the first example I've seen that shows clearly that shared properties may actually be useful. putting this in the spec would be most helpful

[02:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[02:16:00.0000] <foolip>
since allowing shared properties makes elminating itemref loops a bit more difficult, I suppose the only option is make the steps that find the subtrees to crawl very complex or to fix each algorithm modeled on top of "the properties of an item" detect recursion and fail (yuck)

[02:18:00.0000] <foolip>
...to detect...

[02:19:00.0000] <danbri>
maybe http://damowmow.com/temp/a.txt  and similar could go in html wg cvs somewhere? 

[02:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
something like it will go in the spec

[02:20:00.0000] <danbri>
since - for better or worse - rdfa and microdata seem in parallel development, having a set of examples with their expression in each system would be good

[02:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: AFAIK nobody has thought about complexity. There was talk about the AAA being O(n^2) though.

[02:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: As for PHP serializing, the DOM html methods just use the libxml stuff, so don't cope overly well with the new html5 stuff

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: yeah, that could be useful.

[02:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone wants to volunteer to do that, that'd be awesome

[02:25:00.0000] <danbri>
i joined the wg formally but haven't been v involved yet

[02:25:01.0000] <danbri>
maybe i'll collect a few examples and see if the wg wants 'em

[02:25:02.0000] <danbri>
a wiki would be natural except it's tough with markup cos you never know what'll get scrambled :(

[02:25:03.0000] <foolip>
danbri: you could put them on the WHATWG wiki

[02:25:04.0000] <foolip>
lunch

[02:25:05.0000] <Hixie>
i can guarantee that you'll pass the chair's "three interested people to publish" bar if you want to publish a NOTE with such examples

[02:26:00.0000] <danbri>
if i get around to it, will probably start in foaf svn and if i get 5 useful examples, start worriying about where it sohuld really live

[02:26:01.0000] <danbri>
/me has a big pile of other todos this month, but it's an interesting compare/contrast to do

[02:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'm swamped with stuff too

[02:27:01.0000] <danbri>
hixie , do you ever run into R.V.Guha around google?

[02:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
i fear that's a common affliction of standards wonks

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: yeah

[02:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
danbri: he as one of the people i worked with when we did the microdata usability study, in fact

[02:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
he was, even

[02:28:03.0000] <Hixie>
or is

[02:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
just not "as" :-)

[02:29:00.0000] <danbri>
:)

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: checked in the new way of doing itemref=""

[02:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, html4 doesn't even require href="" on <link>

[02:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
"<link>" appears to be valid

[05:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok nn all

[07:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  Joe Williams' latest email sort of trailed into incoherence there at the end.

[07:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's a strange, gradual breakdown of coherency.

[07:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
awesome. I just got confirmation that Selectors API 2 will be published as FPWD tomorrow

[07:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Cool.

[07:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
after FPWD, I think I'm going to seriously consider dropping queryScopedSelector.

[07:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
Though, I'm still waiting for some additional feedback from some people

[07:59:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: what does queryScopedSelector do?

[07:59:01.0000] <foolip>
doesn't calling querySelector on an arbitrary element also scope the results?

[08:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
it implies the presence of :scope at the beginning of the selector, where :scope will match the element it's called on.

[08:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
but that pre-processing only works for selectors that begin with a simple selector, so the common shortcut in JS libraries like "+div" can't be used

[08:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
in most cases, it's functionally the same as calling document.querySelector(":scope+div", elm); where elm is some element you want to select relative to.

[08:04:01.0000] <foolip>
oh, so elm.querySelector doesn't work?

[08:05:00.0000] <foolip>
I remeber trying that many times, but can't remember if it worked or not

[08:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
elm.querySelector only allows you to select descendants, not siblings

[08:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
so while it works for the " " and ">" combinators, it doesn't work for "+" or "~"

[08:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
queryScopedSelector was supposed to solve that, bug since modifying the selector syntax to allow them to being with combinators is out of the question, as far as the CSSWG is concerned, it doesn't really help much

[08:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, Lachy, quit saying that.  It's wrong.

[08:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
There was a specific thing that we didn't like, the ! at the beginning to indicate scoped-ness.

[08:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anne didn't like starting with a combinator, but the rest of us did.

[08:10:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I know Anne hates it. I'm sure there were others in the CSSWG who said I shouldn't be modifying the selector syntax to allow selectors to begin with combinators

[08:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Not in the thread, there weren't.  I reviewed it a week or two ago.

[08:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Parity with jQuery was an important point.

[08:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
there was some initially from fantasai, but looks like she might have somewhat changed her mind in her last mail in the thread

[08:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, TabAtkins, before I decide what to do about queryScopedSelector and whether or not to bring back support for selectors beginning with combinators, I want to get feedback from othermaciej and JS library devs like JohnResi1

[08:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[08:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It seems all the differences in expression ability between RDFa and microdata are either obscure edge cases, or things you shouldn't be doing in the first place

[08:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
isn't the only difference in the ability to specify the value's type in RDFa, whcih is something that should be defined by the vocabulary?

[08:34:01.0000] <Dashiva>
There's also stuff relating to unidentified items (only microdata), cyclical blank nodes (only RDFa) and some others

[09:42:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Goodmorning!

[09:43:00.0000] <cardona507>
,good morning! we really are on the same schedule - I just showed up like 2 minutes ago :)

[09:43:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
haha

[09:43:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Well, cardona, allow me to show you our new website :P i kid

[09:43:03.0000] <cardona507>
hehe

[09:44:00.0000] <cardona507>
HTML5 & CSS3 goodies?! sounds so cutting edge

[09:44:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
yes, oh yes, oooooh yes it's true.

[09:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
JonathanNeal: Congrats on your site launch!

[09:48:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
TabAtkins, thanks, and thank you for the help along the way.

[09:48:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I'm not done learning and following HTML5, though, gotta stay on top of it now that we're officially using it.

[09:52:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Since, you never know, you guys might decide to pull <header> or something on me, I gotta be quick.

[09:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Man, we might.

[09:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
We crazy.

[09:53:02.0000] <cardona507>
no doubt

[09:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Darn, Project Euler is down right now.  ;_

[09:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/;_/;_;/

[09:55:00.0000] <cardona507>
I wasn't aware of Project Euler - that looks pretty cool

[09:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wait, what?  You can see it?

[09:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
downforeveryoneorjustme.com told me that it was everyone!

[09:57:00.0000] <cardona507>
no - I googled it and read the snippet :)

[09:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, ok.

[09:59:00.0000] <cardona507>
did you see that downforeveryoneorjustme.com was recently sold? http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/12/down-for-new-owner/

[10:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, I hadn't seen that.

[10:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Looks like it shouldn't cause any alarm, though.

[10:02:00.0000] <cardona507>
I didn't realize that the site was big enough to warrant a purchase.

[10:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, I really wanna rewrite this stupid thing before I leave.

[10:07:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I hate things that use old apis, especially when they're old apis that I wrote.  >_<

[10:07:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And this is like v1 of the api.  I'm currently on v4, which is *stupidly* cleaner and easier to work with.

[11:03:00.0000] <cardona507>
tabatkins - you probably already knew - but projecteuler.net is live

[11:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, excellent.

[11:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I hadn't checked it again yet.

[11:09:00.0000] <cardona507>
TabAtkins - I am new to this site - can I use JS?

[11:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You can use whatever language you want.  Do them by hand, if you feel like it.

[11:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's nothing more than an opportunity to challenge yourself and increase both your math and programming skills.

[11:10:02.0000] <cardona507>
very interesting...

[11:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's also a great way to jump into a new language and learn the efficiency paradigms underneath it.

[11:17:00.0000] <cardona507>
This is what i've been looking 4

[11:17:01.0000] <cardona507>
and I doubt i'll do them by hand :)

[11:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
It won't load here

[11:18:00.0000] <cardona507>
yeah its actin spotty here too. Gsnedders - congrats on the opera job!

[11:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me feels bad, thinking he ought to know who cardona507 is, especially seeming he's being congratulated

[11:22:00.0000] <cardona507>
:) I don't think we met @ TPAC this year - i am kinda new to WHATWG - maybe 8 months. 

[11:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
He wasn't at TPAC.

[11:23:00.0000] <cardona507>
ahhh that explains it...

[11:59:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
can someone summarize what's happened on public-html the past two weeks?

[12:03:00.0000] <foolip>
do you ask that as a joke or do you really want to know?

[12:03:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
i want to know, i haven't been reading any of it for the past two weeks

[12:04:00.0000] <foolip>
the chairs decided on microdata

[12:04:01.0000] <foolip>
in a veeeery long decision it was decided to split it, as I'm sure you've noticed

[12:04:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
yeah

[12:05:00.0000] <foolip>
lots of new bugs/issues about removing various sections/elements

[12:05:01.0000] <foolip>
many of them filed by Shelley

[12:05:02.0000] <foolip>
oh, and some discussion about autobuffer

[12:05:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie decided to accept many of the split suggestions due to the microdata precedent

[12:06:00.0000] <foolip>
whether or not to change the name and add more states than "on" and "off"

[12:06:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
i think if webkit acted as firefox, no-one would complain about the spec about autobuffer

[12:06:02.0000] <foolip>
there hasn't been any conclusion yet, but I mostly support renaming it and keeping the same two states we have: "auto" and "bufferitallman"

[12:06:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Then there was backlash from all the splits, and discussion about how the decision policy allows people to skip the mailing list completely

[12:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Most of the splits were reverted, and Shelley filed issues for them instead

[12:07:01.0000] <foolip>
I think the 2d context stayed split though

[12:07:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah

[12:07:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
personally i'm against (non-editorial) changes to autobuffer: i think it's fine as is

[12:07:04.0000] <foolip>
as well as... cross-window messaging or something?

[12:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Messaging is being moved to webapps, assuming their charters can get changed to accomodate it

[12:08:01.0000] <Dashiva>
There's also been spillover from the mediawiki discussion about microdata vs rdfa

[12:08:02.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan__: it'll be impossible to implement anything like "stall before downloading anything" in the current state of affairs, which is why I somewhat support renaming it

[12:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Some talk about dumping RDFa completely now that there's no reason to pretend otherwise

[12:09:01.0000] <Dashiva>
*dumping microdata

[12:09:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Heh

[12:09:03.0000] <foolip>
hehe, I thought I'd missed something

[12:09:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Just my personal bias slipping through, I guess :P

[12:09:05.0000] <foolip>
well, there have been a few objections to publishing a FPWD on the basis that the W3C shouldn't compete with its own technologies

[12:10:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
foolip: would we want to do that on anything other than mobile/pay-per-byte anyway?

[12:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And then some people pointed out that w3c competes with itself basically every week

[12:10:02.0000] <foolip>
Dashiva: do you post to the lists? using another name than Dashiva ?

[12:10:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, there was some charter discussion about what is considered extension points and not

[12:11:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
foolip: maybe we can get the spec to require act-like-stall if poster is present?

[12:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
foolip: I do, but only a few times a year

[12:11:02.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan__: right, but we can't really do that with the current spec, because we couldn't go to HAVE_METADATA, which block the load event

[12:12:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
foolip: i thought the spec said not to block the load event if the UA chooses to stall

[12:12:01.0000] <foolip>
tying it to poster was of course the original idea, but poor <audio>

[12:12:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
oh audio

[12:12:03.0000] <foolip>
sure, but then we won't ever fire the load event on window, which is sure to make our browser impopular

[12:12:04.0000] <daedb>
Does <audio> not have poster images?

[12:12:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, and there's been a slow but steady stream of canvas accessibility posts

[12:13:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
foolip: not blockign the load event means the load event gets fired...

[12:13:01.0000] <foolip>
Dashiva: no, they just have controls which are approximate the height of a line of text

[12:13:02.0000] <foolip>
(so says the spec, they're actually bigger in shipped browsers)

[12:14:00.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan__: my concern is that people will write scripts that assume the availability of metadata when the load event fires, which will break if the browser stalls too early (and fires the load event)

[12:15:00.0000] <daedb>
It would be kinda nice to have a poster-like attribute on <audio> for album art.

[12:15:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
foolip: i understand the concern

[12:15:02.0000] <foolip>
daedb: you can always use <img> :)

[12:15:03.0000] <daedb>
But then I have to type more!

[12:16:00.0000] <daedb>
:-p

[12:16:01.0000] <Dashiva>
daedb: Use video?

[12:16:02.0000] <Dashiva>
With an empty video stream :)

[12:16:03.0000] <foolip>
right, that works too actually

[12:16:04.0000] <foolip>
right, <video src="music.oga" poster="coverart.jpg"></video>

[12:17:00.0000] <foolip>
I don't really know if there's a good solution to the ultra-conservative bandwidth approach

[12:18:00.0000] <foolip>
not doing it is also a very realistic alternative

[12:18:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
if *authors* want to be ultra-conservative, is it too much to ask to use a bit of scripting?

[12:18:02.0000] <foolip>
no, it isn't

[12:18:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
i agree

[12:19:00.0000] <foolip>
and arguably the amount of data needed to download the first frame and get duration is quite acceptable

[12:19:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
and if a browser wants to be ultra-conservative, then it'll ignore the attribute anyway

[12:19:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
yeah

[12:19:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
so i still think the spec is fine as is :)

[12:19:04.0000] <foolip>
they can't be too conservative without breaking sites, probably

[12:19:05.0000] <foolip>
yeah, I think I wont push this, I would probably regret it in 5 years

[12:20:00.0000] <foolip>
what else has happened in public-html ... ?

[12:20:01.0000] <ATAN>
Any HTML5 talk on somehow having telephone numbers in links? Kind of like how mailto: is for e-mail, but instead to open up the telephone app on your pc?

[12:21:00.0000] <foolip>
cssquirrel is upset as usual, but this time there was a spin-off podcast with among other brucel which was kind of good (but too long)

[12:21:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
ATAN: there's tel:

[12:21:02.0000] <ATAN>
Oh really? :D How does one use tel: ?

[12:21:03.0000] <ATAN>
*googles*

[12:21:04.0000] <zcorpan__>
<a href="tel:012345">

[12:22:00.0000] <ATAN>
Hmm the doc I see is dated 2004. Is this implemented now?

[12:23:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i think tel: is supported by opera, but not sure

[12:24:00.0000] <daedb>
yaay, <audio> crashed my browser :)

[12:24:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
daedb: which browser?

[12:25:00.0000] <daedb>
zcorpan__: Opera 10.5

[12:26:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
daedb: did it have controls=""?

[12:26:01.0000] <daedb>
yes

[12:26:02.0000] <foolip>
oh right, we know about this bug, all too well

[12:27:00.0000] <foolip>
fear not, it'll be fixed soon

[12:29:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
"working out all the details about how the last thing that they created is going to form a coherent standard, isn’t as much of interest to them." - http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2010/01/15/podcast-44-html5-is-a-beautiful-mess/

[12:29:01.0000] <foolip>
there's a transcript?

[12:29:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
yeah

[12:30:00.0000] <foolip>
oh, I should have skimmed that instead of listening for that whole... 40 minutes

[12:34:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
ok thanks for the summary

[12:34:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
i guess i can now mark all my email as read

[12:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It annoys me when someone splits a thread, I respond to the earlier thread because I see it first, and then I realize I really should have read the split thread first.

[12:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"And then finally we have this ideal of consensus whatever that means on any given day, whether it’s you get 75% of people in the working group voting the same way, you call that consensus and too bad if you’re in the other 25%."

[12:42:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Sounds like consensus isn't what it used to be

[12:44:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
w3c consensus is no objections, isn't it?

[12:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Something like that

[12:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think any definition of consensus lets you override 25%

[12:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikipedia consensus does.

[12:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or, I should say: Wikipedia "consensus" does.

[12:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
A lot of groups seem to have independently realized that consensus-based decision-making is a great idea, and so adopted that, except without the consensus part.

[12:46:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh, right. Forgot about that.

[12:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Wikipedia consensus seems more like benevolent dictator, where the dictator happens to be whatever arbcom member is on duty

[12:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, ArbCom is totally different.  That's just plain votes, but they usually only accept cases where people have been misbehaving and won't stop.

[12:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
AFAIK, the ArbCom always votes in full on any given case, barring recusals.

[12:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
ArbCom members definitely don't have much of any privileges beyond voting on ArbCom cases, last I checked.

[12:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
enwiki has Jimbo Wales as a benevolent dictator.  Everyone else only has Wikimedia employees, who have been known to randomly do whatever they think is appropriate regardless of what anyone thinks.

[12:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(although pretty rarely, and usually with good reason)

[12:49:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Hum, I thought arbcom handled first-line disputes

[12:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Like appeals of page deletion

[12:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, they typically only accept disputes that have been running for months with no resolution by other means, or sometimes one-off sysop misbehavior (since they're the only ones who can desysop).

[12:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
There are about ten ArbCom members.

[12:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You're probably thinking of the myriad other bureaucratic processes on Wikipedia, which are mostly managed by sysops, who number one or two thousand.  Yes, a request for page deletion/undeletion or such is decided by a single sysop arbitrarily.

[12:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And it can really depend on who closes the request.

[12:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Regardless of discussion.

[12:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Aha

[12:52:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There are other procedures that have accreted over time.  Like Raul654 runs the front page unilaterally last I checked, just because he's been running it for years and nobody dislikes him much.

[12:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And promotion to sysop is handled by bureaucrats, who usually do it by strict vote (75-80% support required) but have sometimes ignored the vote.

[12:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And of course anything that doesn't require privileges (like changes to policy pages) is decided by whoever has the most people to flood discussions and revert your edits without appearing tendentious.

[12:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(changes to articles, too)

[12:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
All very chaotic.

[12:55:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
http://cristianadam.blogspot.com/2010/01/ie-tag.html - wonder if this poisons <video> for ie when they want to implement it natively

[13:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Next steps would be: 

[13:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually display a video instead of a gray rectangle"

[13:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think it needs to get a bit further before poisoning anything.  :)

[13:02:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
of course

[13:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know why it would poison anything, though?

[13:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If they do anything differently than what the plugin expects, it'll break pages that use the plugin.

[13:04:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Since it can't tell them apart.

[13:07:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i guess when <video> becomes a known tag, it won't talk to the plugin anymore

[13:07:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
since xmlns is ignored on known html tags

[13:08:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
still, pages could probably somehow depend on the plugin to be used

[13:09:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
it seems safer to use javascript object detection before invoking the plugin

[13:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or just use the fallback mechanism built into <video>?

[13:10:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
AryehGregor: with <video><object ....>? yeah

[13:11:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
hmm, seems using xmlns is a way to make ie8+ recognize unknown tags

[13:11:01.0000] <foolip>
AryehGregor: hope my RDF quirks storytelling made sense

[13:12:00.0000] <foolip>
about the storage, there are other graph databases than triplestores which are very performant, and for microdata something like couchdb makes sense I think

[13:12:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
so <section xmlns=http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml> if you need new elements to work in ie without scripting

[13:12:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
was it in ie7 or ie8 they changed the namespace thing?

[13:13:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
ie8

[13:14:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
wonder if i should make a whatwg blog post about xmlns and ie8

[13:16:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i guess maybe not since it'll litter pages with useless attributes

[13:17:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
http://twitter.com/robin_reala/statuses/7899890739

[13:19:00.0000] <jgraham>
daedb: If you're using Opera 10.50 on Windows and didn't already notice there was a new snapshot build recently 

[13:20:00.0000] <jgraham>
daedb: Also, if you find problems (including site-compat issues), please, please file bugs

[13:20:01.0000] <daedb>
jgraham: Yeah, I know. Already have the latest one ;)

[13:20:02.0000] <jgraham>
Awesome :)

[13:37:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
http://rebuildingtheweb.com/en/invitation-html5-team/ has comments again, wonder if he fixed the bug or just removed Philip`'s comment

[13:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think he just stripped the bogus character from Philip`s comment

[13:39:00.0000] <foolip>
what does clicking "I've read the changes" in the diffs actually do?

[13:39:01.0000] <foolip>
make you feel good?

[13:40:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
it sets a cookie so that the from/to fields are prefilled next time you visit

[13:40:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
useless feature

[13:40:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
feel free to replace it with a next link

[13:40:03.0000] <foolip>
what with userjs?

[13:41:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
no, js

[13:41:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
oh

[13:42:00.0000] <foolip>
I don't have any priviledges on html5.org

[13:42:01.0000] <foolip>
not even a subdomain like you :'(

[13:42:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
i mean http://code.google.com/p/html5/source/browse/#svn/trunk/web-apps-tracker

[13:43:00.0000] <foolip>
oh

[13:43:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
the forms and workers trackers can probably be removed

[13:44:00.0000] <foolip>
/me is hacking on microdata

[13:45:00.0000] <foolip>
I hope the new algorithm is better

[13:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, floating-point error ruins me yet again!

[13:46:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
i'll see if i can get prev/next buttons for the tracker

[13:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm quite impressed with people who have the tenacity to argue with people like Vlad

[13:48:00.0000] <foolip>
who is Vlad, apart from the guy who wrote that blog post?

[13:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
I gave up discussing that error message issue with Vlad. Once he suggested only allowing new elements like <video> and <canvas> to only work in error free pages and not listening to what I was saying, I gave up

[13:51:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
wtf i can't checkout html5 google code

[13:51:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
it says untrusted certificate or somehting

[13:51:02.0000] <foolip>
yeah, it means Hixie can't be trusted

[13:52:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
command line allowed me to checkout anyway

[13:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan__: He changed the thing where I said 'U+FFFF ("�")' to just say "U+FFFF"

[13:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So his blog is still broken then?

[13:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
No

[13:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: He develops the XStandard editor

[13:57:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
only if someone posts a funny character again

[13:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
Uh

[13:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
s/Lachy/foolip/

[13:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
so he's one of the few authoring tools vendors who interacts with the HTML WG in any way

[13:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe I should teach myself how to break XML

[13:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
For fun and profit (tm)

[13:59:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
we should get more authoring tool vendors in the loop

[14:02:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
doesn't html5 have more forbidden character ranges than xml these days?

[14:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan__: But only ones whose opinions we agree with

[14:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: It's not hard

[14:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Just stick U+FFFF (%ef%bf%bf) and U+000B (%0b) in all form inputs you can find

[14:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
and U+0000 too

[14:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But that's so simple. Surely there are other ways

[14:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
Who needs other ways when you've got those ways? :-)

[14:04:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
and the address bar!

[14:04:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe someone fixes those 

[14:04:04.0000] <Philip`>
They probably won't fix all of them

[14:04:05.0000] <Dashiva>
And I want to one-up him

[14:04:06.0000] <zcorpan__>
make a trackback

[14:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Put invalid characters in an X-Forwarded-For header, and the server might blindly report that as your IP

[14:05:01.0000] <Dashiva>
That's more like it

[14:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Instiki didn't filter IPs at all so that was an XSS hole, not just a well-formedness hole)

[14:07:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I bet someone has already made an app for this

[14:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Invalidatr

[14:07:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
it's called "Philip`"

[14:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I can't download Philip`

[14:09:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
but you can interact with Philip` on irc

[14:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not 24/6

[14:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
or even 7

[14:10:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Anyhow, I'm going to interact with my bed

[14:10:03.0000] <Philip`>
Does it interact back?

[14:10:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Only in a third law manner

[14:10:05.0000] <Philip`>
How ordinary

[14:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Quite

[14:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Not even the third law of robotics

[14:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
Then again, talking mattresses are well documented as being irritatingly chirpy

[14:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
so perhaps it's best to stick with normal ones

[14:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
MediaWiki had a fun bug with X-Forwarded-For once.

[14:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It ignores XFF except from trusted IP addresses, of course, since anything else is totally broken.

[14:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikimedia routes everything through Squids, with the Apaches not on the public Internet, so the Squids' IP addresses are whitelisted.

[14:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And they always send an XFF header, of course.

[14:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The Squids also filter out evil X-Forwarded-For headers.

[14:21:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But someone figured out that if you send an X_Forwarded_For header, Squid will ignore it, but PHP will treat it the same as X-Forwarded-For.

[14:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So they tried to frame someone on Wikipedia for vandalism.  But Tim Starling investigated and fixed the bug, and the guy was unbanned.

[14:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's quite evil

[14:22:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
what about X-Forwarded_For?

[14:22:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
zcorpan__, I assume the fix covers that too.

[14:22:04.0000] <Philip`>
(The header naming, not the framing)

[14:22:05.0000] <Philip`>
What about X#Forwarded#For?

[14:22:06.0000] <zcorpan__>
x-forwarded-for?

[14:23:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
forwarded-for?

[14:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, I guess it's because CGI conventionally does s/-/_/g and prefixes HTTP_ to pass headers as environment variables

[14:23:02.0000] <Philip`>
so only _ would suffer from that problem

[14:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I assume PHP follows the same silly interface as CGI despite not having any of the constraints that force it to do so)

[14:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, and it also uppercases.

[14:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's the format of keys for $_SERVER.

[14:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems like an instance of the general problem of blacklisting

[14:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be securer for the Squids to only allow a specific set of headers through

[14:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least when used as reverse proxies, I guess, yeah.

[14:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know what the fix was.

[14:56:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
ok i've checked in prev/next links to web-apps-tracker

[14:57:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
but not tested it

[15:04:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
http://rebuildingtheweb.com/en/irresponsible-to-advocate-html5/

[15:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan__: i think that's what we call a "single-issue voter" (http://rebuildingtheweb.com/en/)

[15:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Bwuh?  Advocating HTML5 is irresponsible because HTMLTidy doesn't yet recognize it?

[15:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
he's an xhtml tool vendor

[15:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
his first mistake is using HTML Tidy. That has never been a good tool to encourage developers to use for general development.

[15:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
so pretty much anything we do in text/html is going to give him issues

[15:07:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
i guess those authoring tools also mangle general web content since clearly they're not parsing html in a way compatible with browsers

[15:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
not much we can do about that given the constraints we're working with

[15:07:05.0000] <daedb>
Hasn't that guy given up yet? He should just stick to XHTML and be done with it.

[15:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
HTML Tidy has limited utility in cleaning up markup from some other source, which is a complete mess when obtained. In that case, running through tidy as an initial clean up step us acceptable

[15:08:01.0000] <foolip>
oh, new blog post?

[15:09:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i wonder how the authoring tools handle perfectly valid xhtml

[15:09:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
i guess xstandard manages

[15:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikipedia uses Tidy.

[15:10:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
can't tidy be run with a set of parameters to make it aware of the new tags?

[15:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If html5lib becomes more mature and adds a "kill invalid stuff through any means necessary" feature, it would be nice to switch to that, but that doesn't seem likely in the immediate future.

[15:10:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
not that it'll fix the doctype or <a><div> problems though

[15:10:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
or other general compat problems tidy has

[15:11:00.0000] <foolip>
haha, he put a lot of effort into that blog post anyway

[15:11:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
i wonder why he doesn't put the effort into making an html5 aware editor

[15:13:00.0000] <foolip>
perhaps he doesn't like HTML

[15:13:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
i wonder why he doesn't put the effort into making an xhtml5 aware editor

[15:13:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: neither do i, but i recognise a lost cause when i see one :-)

[15:14:00.0000] <foolip>
hehe

[15:15:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
where's annevk?

[15:16:00.0000] <foolip>
I think he's on vacation with arjan or something

[15:16:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
ok

[15:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
if there are any plans to add an HTML-Tidy-like feature to html5lib, or to base such a tool on it, then there are some things in the parsing algorithm that should be avoided, or at least be careful about them

[15:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
in particular, the adoption agency algorithm, that can end up creating unwanted duplicate elements just by the accidental omission of an end tag

[15:17:01.0000] <foolip>
hmmm, what should be done instead then?

[15:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. given a case like this:

[15:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
<p>Some paragraph containing <b>an unclosed b element.</p><p>Another paragraph...</p>

[15:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
The parsing algorithm says to insert a new b element into the second paragraph. But it's more likely that the actual intention is to have the b element closed somewhere before the first paragraph

[15:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
I've seen the problem occur many times in forums that allow markup, but which don't sanitise it well. An unclosed link or b element, or something, can screw up the rest of the page

[15:20:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
inducing intention and moving away from the parsing algorithm seems like moving into Tidy land of incompatibility

[15:20:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
<p>foo<b>bar<b>baz</p> - there the second b tag is probably intended to be an end tag

[15:21:00.0000] <foolip>
perhaps sanitize comments/posts one-by-one rather than sanitizing as the last step before output?

[15:21:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
and in <p>foo/p> there's probably a < missing

[15:22:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
the second example is even valid html

[15:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan__, yeah, that's true too. That case might also be detectable, but I'm sure there are limits to what can reasonbly be done. But the goal of a tidy program should be to make a best effort at giving a reasonble result, and not give something that is wildly unexpected and/or require significant cleanup afterwards

[15:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
in the case of an unclosed inline element, choosing not to reopen it again is the least detrimental choice that won't require too much author intervention to clean up again. But inserting a bunch of new elements into subsequent paragraphs will take more time for the author to then go and strip them

[15:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, as long as the output is parsed by browsers the same as the input would have been, is it really the sanitizer's problem?

[15:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, if the sanitizer is supposed to help developers, then it should give a better result than what browsers are forced to do for compatibility reasons

[15:25:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, not if it's being automatically run on every page save or whatever.  If you're planning on editing the output manually, that's different.

[15:25:02.0000] <Lachy>
huh? I think you might be considering a different use case from what I am.

[15:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Possibly.

[15:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikipedia runs Tidy on the user-submitted content in every page before serving it.

[15:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's run as part of the wikitext parsing, toward the end.

[15:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Basically just for the sake of validating.

[15:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
my use case is an author writing some content in a CMS, and submits it. The CMS then checks the input and finds unclosed elements. It could either point out the error and return the markup unchanged for the user to continue editing, or ...

[15:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or just silently fix it and publish.

[15:27:03.0000] <Lachy>
it could offer to clean it up in a sensible way

[15:27:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Offer" is bad UI, most authors don't care, just do it.

[15:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, whatever

[15:28:01.0000] <Lachy>
whether it does it automatically or as a user pref or whatever is irrelevant here.

[15:28:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
use wysiwyg and hide the markup from the user

[15:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
If only wikitext were simple enough to do sane WYSIWYG.  :(

[15:29:00.0000] <Lachy>
not even HTML is simple enough in all cases to do sane wysiwig

[15:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least it's more likely to round-trip without massive changes throughout the source code.

[15:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, wikipedia gets the clean up wrong :-( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sandbox

[15:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow. It also leaves the source text unaltered, rather than fixing the error

[15:33:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
<p>Some paragraph containing <b>an unclosed b element.</b></p>

[15:33:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
<p><b>Another paragraph...</b></p>

[15:34:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
?

[15:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's the wrong way to clean it up. It should be nice to the author and not put the b in the second paragraph

[15:34:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
what if the author wanted the second paragraph to be bold?

[15:34:03.0000] <Lachy>
but I mean, click the edit link and see the source wiki text. I didn't mean in the generated page source

[15:35:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
it would be annoying to fix mistakes if the source was tampered with

[15:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
then they can put a b in the second paragraph manually. An accidentally unclosed element is more likeliy than an intentional mis-nested element

[15:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, users mostly use wikitext for bold, which behaves as you describe.

[15:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
'''Bold text\n\nNo longer bold

[15:36:02.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's the sensible approach

[15:36:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
becomes: <p><b>Bold text</b></p><p>No longer bold</p>

[15:36:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
We don't want to tamper with the source text.

[15:36:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
That way madness lies.

[15:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because we'd have to parse it reliably, and wikitext is so complicated that we can't really parse it, we just apply a bunch of magical transformations that turn it into HTML.

[15:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
sure, with wikitext being as haphazardly designed as it is, I'm sure trying to automate cleaning of it would be a total nightmare

[15:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anything related to wikitext is a total nightmare.

[15:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It sounded like a great idea, but it was one of the worst mistakes wikis made.

[15:38:02.0000] <Lachy>
I hate wikitext. I wish it was never invented.

[15:38:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
The idea was reasonable in the era before WYSIWYG editors were reliably available for the web.

[15:38:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's a lot easier to edit than raw HTML.

[15:38:05.0000] <Lachy>
surely, there would be a way to migrate away from it

[15:38:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
But now it's become counterproductive.

[15:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Do you have any idea how many times this has been discussed?  :)

[15:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
probably many times :-)

[15:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would require an enormous amount of work to migrate away.

[15:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
First of all, we'd need to invent some new language with all the same features, and be able to convert wikitext to that.

[15:39:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think very simple forms of wikitext, such as Markdown, are still a great idea.  Going beyond should just be normal HTML, though.

[15:39:05.0000] <Lachy>
but generating HTML markup from the wikitext is the easy part. That's already done. You would just need to have a system that spends a lot of time generating and storing the HTML markup

[15:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, because wikitext contains tons of info beyond the raw HTML.

[15:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like template calls, for instance.

[15:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The templates are substituted into the wikitext before parsing.

[15:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
We'd have to make up our own syntax one way or another, it can't be pure HTML.

[15:40:04.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, those have to be dealt with in a special way

[15:40:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also other features like that, categories and such.

[15:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which, by the way, can be added via template, so it's not enough to just edit them separately like most software does.

[15:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
but it could be based more on HTML markup, rather than crazy random wikitext syntax

[15:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, we'd probably have to do something HTML-ish.  Except that would probably mean using XML, which would be seriously painful to manually edit.

[15:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And not everyone would want to use WYSIWYG

[15:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
.

[15:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
editing HTML in a browser is only a pain because it lacks any kind of useful editing features, like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, etc.

[15:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I said XML, not HTML.  :)

[15:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
SYNTAX ERROR!

[15:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(on line 479)

[15:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But anyway, it does lack those features, so . . .

[15:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(well, syntax errors aren't so bad with syntax highlighting, I guess)

[15:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Man, more open-source projects need cute mascots: http://www.bugzilla.org/img/buggie.png

[15:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also: http://llvm.org/img/DragonMedium.png

[15:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
MediaWiki just has a stupid flower with square brackets around it.  :(

[15:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Argh, I've accomplished nothing today except arguing with people.

[15:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
you say that like that's a bad thing!

[15:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's my life you're dismissing like that there! :-P

[15:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You also edit specs from time to time, I've heard?

[15:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but that's just the output of arguments :-P


2010-01-19
[16:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wouldn't mind if I had *gotten* anywhere in the arguments.

[16:05:00.0000] <foolip>
AryehGregor: do you understand the RDFa validation points?

[16:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
foolip, what

[16:05:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
?

[16:05:03.0000] <foolip>
that Manu is making

[16:05:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Possibly not.

[16:05:05.0000] <foolip>
me neither, will ask for clarification so that we can steal any good ideas

[16:05:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm assuming that RDFa has some automatic validation mechanism like DTDs are to XML, except maybe more powerful.

[16:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you have some language where you can see "this attribute must have only these values" or whatnot.

[16:06:01.0000] <foolip>
perhaps it's just RDFS

[16:06:02.0000] <foolip>
that would make sense I guess

[16:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
On a random note: who decided that GNOME Mines should be classified under "Games > Logic"?  Someone who never played Minesweeper in their life?

[16:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
Makes sense to me, since it's almost entirely logic

[16:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
other than random guessing at the start

[16:08:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
it's not random guessing at the start really

[16:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Except for the fact that if you actually play it, you see the right spots by reflex and never have to apply logic?

[16:08:02.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
the first click should be guaranteed not to be a mine

[16:08:03.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
by reflex?

[16:08:04.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, Minesweeper is entirely logic based.

[16:08:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
More or less.

[16:08:06.0000] <Philip`>
The second click often has to be a random guess :-)

[16:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, not in the GNOME version.  The first click is always guaranteed to have no adjacent mines, so it reveals a whole area.

[16:09:01.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
AryehGregor: you just mean, you can work it out by using the visible information?

[16:09:02.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
AryehGregor: sounds logical to me

[16:09:03.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: That's just applying pattern-recognition to determine the logical solution without having to recompute the logic every time

[16:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
the windows version is not guaranteed to have no adjacent minds. Often, you'll click a square that just gives a 1, making the next click a random guess. Other times, you'll get a large area cleared

[16:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
a) On many/most large boards, you end up having to guess at some point late in the game.

[16:10:02.0000] <Lachy>
I normally hit the four corners first and then proceed

[16:10:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: With a sufficiently high density of mines, logic *is* requires at some points.

[16:10:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
And yes, at least one guess becomes required in many boards.

[16:10:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
b) It ends up being mostly pattern-recognition, with only a few small spots of logic required now and again.

[16:10:06.0000] <Philip`>
I normally just edit C:\WINDOWS\WINMINE.INI to get the top score

[16:10:07.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders if there's a Minesweeper for Mac

[16:10:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
True.

[16:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
(This was quite a while ago, though)

[16:11:01.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
pattern recognition isn't logical?

[16:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
c) Any decent player will win every board unless forced to guess.  The only challenge is getting the fastest time.

[16:11:03.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
it might be simple, but it's still logical

[16:11:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
GarethAdams|Home, by that interpretation, every game could be put into "Logic".

[16:11:05.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
AryehGregor: poker isn't

[16:11:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm not sure how (c) is a point against it being in the Logic category.

[16:11:07.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Pinball couldn't

[16:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, because the challenge in the game has nothing to do with logic.  It's a twitch-based game.

[16:12:01.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
snakes and ladders isn't

[16:12:02.0000] <foolip>
/me feels sorry for readers of Wikitech

[16:12:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
GarethAdams|Home, sure poker is, you have to logically evaluate your opponent's reaction to various possible options of facial expression.

[16:12:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Until you build your pattern recognition skills, logic is certainly required to deduce some locations.

[16:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
foolip: I'd assume people who live in proximity to wikis are quite used to loud arguments by now

[16:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, sure it is, you have to logically compute the physical trajectory of the pinball given your timing in hitting the flipper.

[16:13:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
And even then, there are some configurations that I know I've run into that aren't pattern-recognizable without an absurdly large (for a human) pattern database.

[16:13:03.0000] <foolip>
Philip`: hehe, possibly

[16:13:04.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: You appear to be using "logical" as a completely meaningless term

[16:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
GarethAdams|Home, snakes and ladders . . . you have to . . . logically . . . figure out how to rig the die appropriately.

[16:14:01.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
AryehGregor: there's no mapping of facial expression to poker hand

[16:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
or at least I can't work out a meaning that would apply in that situation

[16:14:03.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
AryehGregor: so it;s not something you can logically deduce

[16:14:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, well, yes, that's my point, practically anything is logical if "pattern recognition" counts as logical.

[16:14:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, the point is, the game is reflex-based, it's not a puzzle game.

[16:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's recognising logical patterns

[16:15:01.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
AryehGregor: getting a high score is reflex based. the game itself is logical

[16:15:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've had situations where I've had to sit down and say "Okay, that 3 implies that there are at least two mines in this area, which is covered by a 5, which already has a mine marked, and also partially overlaps the area of this 2…"

[16:15:03.0000] <Philip`>
and not e.g. recognising cats vs dogs

[16:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, yes, once in a while.  But it does not belong in the same category as, say, sudoku.

[16:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(not that I play sudoku)

[16:18:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, define "logical pattern".

[16:18:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Pfah.  Sudoku is nothing more than pattern-recognition.

[16:18:04.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: A pattern a compute can easily deduce

[16:18:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
There are a handful of very simple patterns to apply to the board to solve it.

[16:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Sudoku is reflex-based pattern recognition if you're good at it :-p

[16:19:01.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
sudoku is a reflex game

[16:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, so let's just agree that "Logic" is a stupid category and be done with it.

[16:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd rather agree that your use of "logic" is wrong and bad.  ^_^

[16:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Anyway, off to play video games!  Wee!

[16:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
I'll happily agree that Logic is a useful category that normal people would understand as being a sensible way to distinguish minesweeper and pinball

[16:20:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Feh.

[16:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notes that AryehGregor is continuing his theme of arguing with people and getting nowhere ;-)

[16:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
On a different note, I commend the GNOME developers for managing to make a Minesweeper implementation that's visibly slow and unresponsive.

[16:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, :(

[16:21:03.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
putting games into categories is just pattern recognition

[16:21:04.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Maybe you need a faster GPU

[16:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's quite a graphically intensive game, particularly with large grids

[16:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, GNOME Calculator takes about as long to start up as Chrome.

[16:22:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's with my tabs from last time remembered.

[16:22:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
srsly wtf.

[16:22:04.0000] <Philip`>
Are these all Mono applications?

[16:22:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I doubt it.

[16:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's impressive if they make it slow without pulling in a giant framework like that

[16:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I read in a Chromium developer discussion that it's because it checks tons of paths for icons or something.

[16:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
$ strace gcalctool 2>&1 | grep ENOENT | wc -l

[16:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
1260

[16:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's not it, though: $ strace /opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --disable-plugins 2>&1 | grep ENOENT | wc -l

[16:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
1791

[16:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well.

[16:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me goes to play Baldur's Gate 2

[16:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me saved a couple of seconds from his game's startup time by moving some code (FAM directory watches) into a separate thread

[16:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
Synchronous IO is really painful :-(

[16:36:02.0000] <cardona507>
/me digs into projecteuler.net

[16:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me is in a customer support "chat" with t-mobile when the support person just wrote "I can really appreciate the concern in needing to get this taken care of for you.  I would feel the same way if this were to happen to me,Customer Name."

[16:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Haha.

[16:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
haha

[16:46:00.0000] <cardona507>
no freakin way - haha

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
and apparently she can only add $35 to my account per day

[16:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
(!)

[16:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
so since the error they made was $67, it'll take two days

[16:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
(!)

[16:46:05.0000] <Hixie>
hate to know what happens if they lose a $3500 payment

[16:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's what you get when there are so few sellers and such high transaction costs to switching.

[16:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(switching providers, I mean)

[16:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
google voice ftw

[16:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
though to be fair the high transaction cost in switching appears to be because becoming a customer is SO DAMN HARD

[16:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
and not so much the phone number issue

[16:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Don't people usually buy a phone with a plan and automatically become a customer?

[16:51:01.0000] <mikekelly>
annevk's open ID page includes a stylesheet with the Link header - could javascript be included the same way?

[16:52:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
mikekelly: no

[16:52:01.0000] <mikekelly>
is that something that's been rejecteed?

[16:53:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
<link rel=script> has been proposed and rejected; i don't think anyone has proposed including script from http headers

[16:53:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
that seems like a security nightmare

[16:53:02.0000] <mikekelly>
why is that?

[16:54:00.0000] <mikekelly>
just curious

[16:54:01.0000] <mikekelly>
why does that seem like it woul dbe asecurity nightmare I mean :)

[16:54:02.0000] <Philip`>
(By "just curious" I assume you mean you'll spend the next two hours arguing for the feature? :-) )

[16:54:03.0000] <mikekelly>
ppppretty much.

[16:55:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
injecting http headers somehow (maybe using a linebreak in x-forwards-for)

[16:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: i bought a sim card with a plan and they told me it had an error, then tried to buy a sim card with a plan again and they didn't credit my account with the amount i paid

[16:56:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
nn

[16:56:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah.

[16:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[16:56:04.0000] <mikekelly>
if you're injecting headers could you not just modify the body?

[16:56:05.0000] <zcorpan__>
mikekelly: maybe

[16:57:00.0000] <mikekelly>
lol.

[16:57:01.0000] <mikekelly>
:D

[17:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, seriously, what is wrong with the telco's on the US?! They seem to have so many crazy ways of operating

[17:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah apparently being a bandwidth provider in the US requires you to be incompetent

[17:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's probably an FCC regulation or something

[17:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose I can't really laugh. I've had enough trouble with Apple support recently, and the guy on the phone today seemed totally uninformed about the issues.

[17:21:00.0000] <foolip>
Lachy: Manu says hi to your arm

[17:22:00.0000] <foolip>
not really, he says "PS: Tell Lachy that I hope his arm feels better soon. :)"

[17:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
my Time Capsule died, and the result of the conversation ended up being that I have a choice: 1. Get a new Time Capsule and lose all the data on it; or 2. Open it up, pull out the disk and put it into a new enclosure, but lose the warranty

[17:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, that's nice of him, I guess.

[17:22:03.0000] <Lachy>
was this in an e-mail discussion, or some private chat between you two?

[17:22:04.0000] <foolip>
in the Wikitech thread

[17:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll find it later as I read through it.

[17:25:01.0000] <foolip>
yep

[17:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: it's a backup, why does it matter what's on it?

[17:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
(also, dude, get a drobo. anything relying on a single disk is just silly at this point.)

[17:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Drobo?

[17:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's a hardware enclosure for 4 hard disks that uses a proprietary raid-like solution for redundancy, in which you can hot-swap drives and expand capacity by adding more drives or increasing the size of any of the drives.

[17:31:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, because I haven't been using it just for time machine backups

[17:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh.

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
well then you're not using it per apple's recommendations. :-P

[17:32:01.0000] <foolip>
then it truly is a time machine, it brings you back to the state of your last full backup!

[17:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
apple's stuff only has great tech support so long as you follow steve's vision

[17:32:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, well. it doesn't matter. I'll just get a cheap drive enclosure, and I still have a usable 1TB disk

[17:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
(if you deviate from the Path, things go poorly)

[17:32:05.0000] <Lachy>
so i didn't lose much, since I wasn't really using the Time Capsule for its airport functions

[17:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[17:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
also, I might be able to get the power supply fixed

[17:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, why not just use software RAID?

[17:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: well, it requires software support, and it doesn't let you mix-and-match drives or hot-swap them while the machine is running

[17:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, because the Drobo is so much better

[17:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
(indeed, while the disk is in use)

[17:34:03.0000] <Lachy>
I have one too

[17:34:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, software RAID lets you mix-and-match drives and hot-swap them while the machine is running.

[17:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least, good software RAID (by which I mean Linux).

[17:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, having a dedicated hardware raid handle it is useful since it doesn't waste CPU resources on managing the disks

[17:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I have one RAID10 partition on two 500G disks, and one RAID1 on an 80G SSD and a 160G normal hard drive, set to read only from the SSD and delay writes to the hard drive.

[17:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, CPU overhead for RAID is typically trivial, especially if it's not RAID5 or 6.

[17:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can hot-swap drives using regular old SATA hotplug.

[17:36:03.0000] <Lachy>
Raid 5 or 6 are the better alternatives though

[17:36:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Only if you really need the space.

[17:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
I do need the space

[17:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, only useful if you have three or more drives.

[17:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, for RAID5/6 the CPU usage is still typically not much at all.

[17:37:03.0000] <Lachy>
I have so many terrabytes of DVD rips and downloaded shows, I can't waste any of it

[17:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Can you put your root filesystem on this Drobo thing?  What interface does it use, eSATA or something?

[17:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
it also depends what you're using it for.  I have a RAID 1 and a RAID 0 setup on in PC, with 2 disks each, which. One for the system, one for other user data.

[17:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
s/on in/in my/

[17:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
RAID0 is lame.  I hate the thought of downtime just because some stupid disk failed.

[17:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(even for my desktop, yes)

[17:40:02.0000] <Lachy>
but I can't possibly have a RAID within my MacBook Pro or iMac, since their hardware just doesn't support it

[17:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What?  You can use software RAID on any hardware.

[17:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least, if you use a decent OS.

[17:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Er, unless you only have one disk, I guess.

[17:41:03.0000] <Lachy>
RAID0 is good if you just care about the performance, rather than worrying about drive failure

[17:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikipedia uses/used RAID0 for all its database servers!

[17:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But they're all replicas, so . . . worst that happens is the site goes read-only for a while until a sysadmin promotes a slave to master, if the master fails.

[17:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: i guess you do the software raid with some sort of external disk enclosure?

[17:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: or...?

[17:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, no, I just open up my computer and replace the drives.

[17:43:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
SATA hotplug works fine for internal drives.

[17:43:05.0000] <Lachy>
I'd still need some external enclosure to hold all the disks, so I may as well pick an external enclosure that handles all the raid stuff transparently for me, regardless of which machine I'm accessing it from

[17:43:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just don't brush against the fans, they can sting.

[17:43:07.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: my two drobos are connected to a mac mini. The mac mini is about the size of one of the 7 disks.

[17:43:08.0000] <Hixie>
so they ain't gonna fit

[17:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Mac Minis are laptops, the size of a disk?

[17:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me only uses a desktop, currently.  Would probably not put anything on a laptop that he cared about.

[17:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
no, Mac Mini's about about 20cm, about the size of an Airport Extreme square Macs

[17:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
ah, I messed that sentence up

[17:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
no, Mac Mini's about about 20cm square Macs, about the size of an Airport Extreme 

[17:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
20 cm is 8 in, so that's . . . small.  But more than twice as wide as a disk.

[17:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: i was exaggerating a bit :-)

[17:45:04.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.apple.com/macmini/

[17:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, just checking.

good evening

[17:46:10.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me doesn't know anything about Mac, except they're shiny and have bash and OpenSSH preinstalled these days.

[17:46:11.0000] <othermaciej>
very shiny!

[17:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Give me an Internet-connected computer with SSH, and it'll do, at worst I can SSH into my desktop to do any real work.

[17:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or one of my servers.

[17:47:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me hates using Windows on public computers somewhat more than Mac for this reason: no real command line.

[17:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
windows machines have DOS and telnet. What more would you need?

[17:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me ducks

[17:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They don't have DOS.  Do you mean cmd.exe?

[17:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: that's what i always do. The only apps I have running on this mac right now are Terminal with SSH sessions, Chrome for the Web, and a VNC client.

[17:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
(i use vnc to control itunes running on the aforementioned mac mini which acts as my tv)

[17:52:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, hah.  So you do all your work on servers, or you have a desktop somewhere you're SSHd to?

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
most of my work is done in emacs and pine on hixie.ch (aka whatwg.org)

[17:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
When I'm at school I generally do assignments with vim and pdflatex remotely.

[17:52:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(so actually on my desktop)

[17:52:04.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, yes, of course. It's still supports the same old DOS commands

[17:52:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, DOS is the name of an OS, not a command line.

[17:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, I was using the term loosely

[17:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's like calling an elephant a hippopotamus because they're both big and gray.

[17:55:00.0000] <foolip>
what is the name of the shell used in DOS?

[17:55:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
That's like calling a hippopotamus a Dorian.

[17:55:02.0000] <Lachy>
geez. No need to make such a big deal out of the terminology.

[17:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
cmd.exe.

[17:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think.

[17:56:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Assuming it had a name, back in the day.

[17:56:03.0000] <Lachy>
foolip, I don't think it has a separate name. It's easiest to just call it the dos shell. AryehGregor, that's just the name of the executable

[17:56:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
"DOS shell" is probably right, yeah.

[17:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, c'mon, this is a software standards channel, you expect to get away with conflating a shell with an OS?

[17:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes, I do

[17:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rats.  Foiled.

[17:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think I still have a copy of DOS 5 lying around, though probably back in Aus. I wonder if it still works, or if the floppy has given up.

[18:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I would hate Windows so much less if it had bash and all the standard GNU utilities installed by default.

[18:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And if it had some equivalent to apt-get.

[18:07:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . and if it were Linux, I guess.

[18:08:00.0000] <NickYoung>
the windows equivalent to apt-get would require a credit card number as a cmd line argument ;)

[18:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
:/

[18:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I read the FAQ for Intel's SSD cleaner program thing recently.

[18:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Last question: "Q: Will there be a Linux version available?  A: No, we're just going to get this functionality built into the stock kernel."

[18:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's so totally representative of Windows vs. Linux.  Windows: install some dubious third-party program to do anything, probably containing malware or at least nagware, unless it costs money.  Linux: works out of the box (if at all, admittedly).

[18:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
My father was impressed when he plugged in his iPod to a Linux laptop and it popped up an iTunes imitation, preinstalled.

[18:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
apt-get has such an aweful UI

[18:16:01.0000] <Lachy>
*awful

[18:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
In what way?

[18:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
well, it's a command line, for starters. And the GUIs I've seen for it have not been designed for user friendliness

[18:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think the iTunes AppStore model should be adopted for computer software, except without the DRM

[18:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The Ubuntu Software Center is fairly user-friendly.

[18:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So was their old one, Add/Remove Applications.

[18:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course you can't add/remove arbitrary packages with those, you have to use Synaptic for that, which is pretty awful.

[18:19:03.0000] <Lachy>
maybe they've improved it since I last tried ubuntu a couple of years ago

[18:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I still hate ubuntu, since it's so ugly and gets even the most basic UI things wrong

[18:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The Software Center is new in 9.10.  They plan to improve and expand it in the future to be a single central well-designed package management GUI.

[18:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You mean compared to other Linux distros, or compared to Mac/Windows?

[18:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, compared to other linux distros, it's not so bad. But compared with Mac and Windows, it's horrible to use

[18:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't use Mac much, but it seems only slightly worse than Windows if you stick to very common tasks.  If you stray off the beaten path, though, you very quickly end up at a command line.

[18:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm curious to know what particular things you had in mind, though.

[18:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
it's equivaelent to Windows Explorer or Finder (whatever it's called in Linux) was really bad, since it had no simple tree view pane (I even have this complaint about Mac, but at least column view is acceptable)

[18:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is where I start saying "Oh, I dunno, I always use the command line for that."

[18:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
right. Being forced to use the command line for even simple file system navigation is a pain

[18:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not even sure what a tree view is.  I can't recall ever using that on Explorer.

[18:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
In Explorer.  Windows.  You know.

[18:24:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(BTW, the GNOME file manager is Nautilus, KDE's is Konqueror, Xfce's is Thunar, . . .)

[18:24:04.0000] <Lachy>
Tree View is the left column http://www.enriva.com/images/screenshots/windows_explorer.gif

[18:24:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, that.

[18:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm not sure I ever used that in my life on Windows.

[18:25:01.0000] <Lachy>
that's the most efficient way to navigate around in Windows Explorer.

[18:25:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Konqueror has a column-view thingie that seems to look vaguely like I remember Finder looking like.

[18:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although I don't know, since I rarely use Mac.

[18:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Aha, thunar has what you want.

[18:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
another thing I hated was the mouse drivers sucked. No matter how I adjusted the speed, it was never right. It was always either too slow or too fast. It seemed to lack the intelligence that the Windows drivers have

[18:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
GNOME usually avoids giving you options like tree view vs. normal view.

[18:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Really?  Odd.  Never noticed that.

[18:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://thunar.xfce.org/images/filewindow-6.png

[18:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps your used to the inferior mouse driving. Most people don't adjust their mice speed anyway and put up with the RSI-inducing defaults.

[18:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems the same as Windows, anyway.

[18:28:02.0000] <Lachy>
well, that's an improvent. But still ugly as hell

[18:28:03.0000] <Lachy>
*improvement

[18:29:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me using keyboard to navigate most of the time in Mac OS X finder.

[18:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
the font is terribly large and the letter spacing is too much.

[18:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh, I guess everyone has different preferences.  I don't care much about aesthetics, and am happy with command lines.

[18:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't mind command lines to do some things. But i can't possibly handle doing everything in command lines

[18:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I use GUIs for IRC and web browsing, that's it.  I do basically everything else by command line.

[18:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, a few other random things I also use GUIs for, like FTP.

[18:32:00.0000] <karlcow>
a lot about the UI prefs depends on habits.

[18:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
I used to use a GUI for FTP stuff. But since there are no good FTP clients for Mac, I mostly just use scp and ssh

[18:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I do that too, except when I have to deal with web hosts where I only have FTP access.

[18:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't deal with web hosts that don't offer shell access any more

[18:34:00.0000] <karlcow>
Lachy: did you try the finder for ftp?

[18:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't except for my synagogue's website, which I manage.

[18:34:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I tried Nautilus for FTP, but it didn't work well, can't remember the details.

[18:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I could probably just find a command that syncs files over FTP, like scp for FTP, with some kind of login caching.  Then I wouldn't have a use for Filezilla.

[18:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if any of my old code is still in Nautilus

[18:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably, if you submitted any noticeable amount.  It's amazing how old code sticks around forever.

[18:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Until you want to burn it with fire.

[18:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me just ran across a JS file in MediaWiki that had UA checks for IE4 and NN4, srsly

[18:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I was one of the main developers of Nautilus in the early days

[18:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I have no idea how much it's been rewritten since then

[18:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Neat.

[20:37:00.0000] <eli__>
hello

[20:37:01.0000] <eli__>
html5 can play streaming?

[20:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
video?

[20:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
in theory

[20:38:02.0000] <eli__>
Hixie, thank you

[20:38:03.0000] <eli__>
well...

[20:38:04.0000] <eli__>
I want look to html5 streaming sample site

[20:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.youtube.com/html5

[20:40:00.0000] <eli__>
thanks, but it is not streaming

[20:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
what do you mean by "streaming"_?

[20:40:02.0000] <eli__>
on demand video play

[20:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
how is that not on-demand video playback?

[20:41:01.0000] <eli__>
example, use Flash media server or windows media server

[20:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh

[20:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's purely a server-side issue

[20:41:04.0000] <eli__>
:)

[20:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
html5 doesn't define the server-side aspect of video playback

[22:24:00.0000] <erlehmann>
eli__, what exactly do you want ?

[22:26:00.0000] <eli__>
I want streaming boardcasting by use html5's video tag.

[22:28:00.0000] <NickYoung>
eli__: as Hixie says, that's already theoretically possible. You set the video source to a network resource and there's a chance the backend will attempt to stream it.

[22:29:00.0000] <eli__>
thank you everybody.

[22:29:01.0000] <eli__>
I don't know about video tag.

[22:30:00.0000] <eli__>
for example in youtube/html5

[22:30:01.0000] <eli__>
it use <video src="http <- http protocol

[22:30:02.0000] <eli__>
I knew that streaming protocol is not http

[22:30:03.0000] <Hixie>
you can use whatever protocol you want (assuming the browser supports it) -- the spec doesn't require any particular protocol

[22:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
HTTP can be used for streaming, actually

[22:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
though it's not especially pretty

[22:31:02.0000] <eli__>
really?

[22:32:00.0000] <eli__>
oh, thank you very much

[22:32:01.0000] <NickYoung>
eli__: It is up to the browser (or more specifically, the multimedia backend) to determine if it can start playback before it has downloaded the entire media file

[22:34:00.0000] <eli__>
http://www.youtube.com/html5

[22:35:00.0000] <eli__>
is this site streaming? or just download and play?

[22:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
streaming

[22:36:00.0000] <eli__>
and use http protocol?

[22:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[22:37:00.0000] <eli__>
be not progressive downloading, it is on demand streaming, right?

[22:39:00.0000] <NickYoung>
eli__: This depends on the browser

[22:39:01.0000] <eli__>
:)

[22:39:02.0000] <eli__>
everybody so kind

[22:39:03.0000] <eli__>
thank you

[22:39:04.0000] <NickYoung>
eli__: But for example, I have an experimental webkit build which supports RTP streamed media

[22:40:00.0000] <NickYoung>
(well, theoretically anyway, I haven't tested it)

[22:41:00.0000] <NickYoung>
but you could have <video src="rtp://...">

[22:51:00.0000] <eli__>
sorry to little question, nickyoung

[22:52:00.0000] <eli__>
I check youtube.com/html5 web page

[22:52:01.0000] <eli__>
it has "<video width="640" height="360" src="/demo/google_main.mp4?2" autobuffer> " in source

[22:52:02.0000] <NickYoung>
yep

[22:53:00.0000] <eli__>
and the link can download movie

[22:53:01.0000] <NickYoung>
this is probably a progressive download, not on demand

[22:54:00.0000] <NickYoung>
you would need to use something like a rtsp:// uri for on demon

[22:54:01.0000] <NickYoung>
on demand*

[22:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: what do you think of making the spec explicitly drop hidden="" subtrees from the microdata processing?

[22:55:00.0000] <eli__>
rtsp is window media server's protocol, right?

[22:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
RTSP is a standard protocol: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2326

[22:56:01.0000] <NickYoung>
eli__: I don't think window's media server uses it by default

[22:56:02.0000] <NickYoung>
eli__: but I am no expert on window's media server :)

[22:58:00.0000] <eli__>
oh, I had remember miss information. thank you hixie

[23:00:00.0000] <eli__>
nickyoung : :)

[23:02:00.0000] <NickYoung>
eli__: Some googling suggests Window Media Services uses MMS - a proprietary streaming protocol

[23:03:00.0000] <eli__>
:) thank you

[23:04:00.0000] <NickYoung>
I am curious now to try rtsp streaming on my webkit build

[23:08:00.0000] <eli__>
why do you want rtsp protocol?

[23:09:00.0000] <eli__>
another protocol? for example, rtmp?

[23:10:00.0000] <eli__>
is html5's base?

[23:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Oh boy, more poetry

[23:11:00.0000] <NickYoung>
rtsp is an open protocol, plus, it's the only one which supports proper on demand streaming, I think

[23:11:01.0000] <eli__>
:)

[23:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: as I understand it, the Mac OS X kernel participates in managing the file system on a Drobo

[23:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see how it could

[23:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I got a ReadyNAS instead in order to have a distinct kernel for the filesystem

[23:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
the only thing you need software for with the drobo is reformatting it to greater than the 2TB default partition size

[23:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: how does Mac OS X access it?

[23:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I thought it showed up as a local volume

[23:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
USB storage or firewire storage

[23:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: but USB and Firewire give you a block device and the OS manages the filesystem, right?

[23:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
no idea

[23:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
but my drobos worked fine before i installed the software

[23:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
my assumption was that the OS default file system implementation was used

[23:21:03.0000] <hsivonen>
hence no installation required

[23:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
my point is that Mac OS X *will* crash

[23:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and HFS+ *will* get mangled

[23:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so I prefer to have ext3 under a distinct kernel on the ReadyNAS and have the Mac talk to it over the network

[23:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
a pure block device wouldn't know how much space is free, surely

[23:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
the OS thinks it's a 16TB external disk, with about 14TB free

[23:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
yet the drobo has LEDs showing how much is really free

[23:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know how the Drobo works

[23:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
so i don't know how they did it, but it doesn't seem like the kernel has that much say on what is going on

[23:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but if it shows up as a USB/Firewire disk, it seems to me that the kernel of the host computer has to be participating in file system access

[23:24:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
is full text search going to be in the database spec?

[23:24:03.0000] <tiglionabbit>
it's in gears, and it's helpful

[23:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: database spec is pretty much stalled since microsoft and mozilla refuse to implement it (assuming you mean the sql one)

[23:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
they could have the device know about a few file systems to read the device for free space (and to re-RAID it when needed)

[23:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: dunno

[23:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: so far i've had plenty of hard disk issues, but none relating to Mac OS X screwing over the disk

[23:25:04.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: only hardware issues

[23:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
though one of my damaged disks is in a state where if i plug it into a mac computer the mac hangs because the kernel goes mad trying to do something with the journal

[23:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
(which it can't since the disk is dead)

[23:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
and i can't get a mac to reformat the disk

[23:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
since it immediately tries to fix the disk, thus hanging until i unplug the disk...

[23:29:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
Hixie: sure, but it's in webkit already -- does it have any full text search extensions though?

[23:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
dunno what the status of implementations is

[23:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's nice to see that the new formal process is being properly taken advatnage of

[23:51:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
are there any plans to make tablet pressure and sub-pixel positioning a javascript event property?

[23:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
not concrete plans

[23:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
every few months someone says we should, but they never actually stick around long enough to write a spec :-)

[23:51:03.0000] <tiglionabbit>
heh

[23:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
part of the problem is we don't actually have a spec for 'click' and 'mousemove' currently

[23:51:05.0000] <tiglionabbit>
well what do you need in the spec?

[23:52:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
oh really

[23:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
or 'keydown' and 'keypress'

[23:52:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
that's all non-standard?

[23:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
non-standard or very vaguely specified

[23:52:04.0000] <tiglionabbit>
worst part is the mouse button numbers

[23:52:05.0000] <tiglionabbit>
which are different between browsers

[23:53:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
guess that should be pinned down first

[23:54:00.0000] <pesla>
Hixie: Would you recommend people to start using the html5 doctype and the current spec?

[23:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
the doctype certainly

[23:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
and the spec, for features that were in html4, also certainly -- the html5 spec is far better at describing those features than html4 was, even in its current draft form

[23:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
i would be careful with the new features though

[23:55:03.0000] <pesla>
Yea, exactly my opinion.

[23:55:04.0000] <pesla>
Thanks :)

[23:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. i wouldn't use <article> yet (though many people are doing so, so what do i know)

[23:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
if IE supports a feature (e.g. onhashchange), it's pretty stable

[23:56:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
I'm curious -- is there anything stopping web browsers from implementing <script type="text/python"> ?

[23:57:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
I guess a spec for how the dom should work in other languages perhaps

[23:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
a spec, a reason, time, and money :-)

[00:01:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
is there any reason why <article> or <arbitrary-tag> wouldn't work already?  They have been style-able in gecko and webkit for some time now, and I think there's some way to get IE to do it too

[00:02:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
does html5 have instructions for what should happen when unknown tags are encountered?

[00:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
you have to use hacks and styles and stuff to use things like <article>

[00:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
html5 defines everything like that, yes

[00:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
should make it easier to introduce new elements later

[00:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: do you have a preliminary guess of where the about:blank stuff might be going?

[00:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
no, but i have scheduled friday to fix it

[00:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
great

[01:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so I notice that a year or so ago George submitted a jing patch that improves reporting for missing-attribute and missing-element cases

[01:03:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/issues/detail?id=35

[01:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: yeah. I had hoped to see the patch on trunk by now

[01:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: James seemed to not want to land it until some revisions to PatternValidator get made

[01:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/issues/detail?id=35#c1

[01:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
(James' comment)

[01:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: but there are a couple of problems with that patch as implemented

[01:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
one is the format of the error messages it emits

[01:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ideally, the expection objects would carry enough data for formatting the message on the application side

[01:07:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
for example, for <link> it will give you: "[href, rel] required attributes missing from element link"

[01:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah

[01:09:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so the other problem is that it does not provide enough information for at least one case I can think of

[01:09:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
which is the case of <object>

[01:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
where the requirement is basically an OR case

[01:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
a data attribute OR a type attribute

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what does it provide in that case?

[01:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
same as for the link case -- it just emits, "[data, type] required attributes missing from element object"

[01:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
his implementation just adds the attributes to a Set

[01:12:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
on then it calls toString to dump that

[01:13:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: it wouldn't really add to complexity since we're already cutting subtrees based on the precense of itemscope

[01:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ah. I wonder how hard it would be to distinguish "all of these" and "one of these"

[01:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
HTML5 doesn't have "one of these groups", IIRC

[01:13:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: maybe not so hard. I'll take a look at it a bit more and see

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: i have no idea what you're responding to :-)

[01:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: or I guess maybe I should ping George about it first

[01:14:02.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: 'what do you think of making the spec explicitly drop hidden="" subtrees from the microdata processing?'

[01:14:03.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: or maybe ping James and George both in the bug report

[01:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: OK

[01:16:01.0000] <foolip>
however, I'm not quite sure what good it would do, it would most certainly cause surprise to some people

[01:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[01:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
brb

[01:19:00.0000] <foolip>
since CSS selectors, getElementById, etc won't ignore that which is hidden="", my vote would be no

[01:20:00.0000] <foolip>
but I admit to not entirely understanding the purpose of hidden="" to begin with

[01:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but your response here about nested vocabularies seems confusing http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/0905.html

[01:27:00.0000] <Lachy>
You wrote: "I think it's better to just use itemtype="" everywhere you want to start a new vocabulary" - but in the vCard example foolip gave, the nested adr stuff isn't a new vocabulary. I thought foolip's idea was that it should default to inhereting the itemtype

[01:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
But in the somewhat contrived example you gave, where they are different, it does make sense to require an explicit itemtype

[01:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: adr is a "new vocabulary" for the purposes of that sentence

[01:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
sorry for being ambiguous

[01:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
i really meant a new set of name-value pair names

[01:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, it shouldn't be. That seems very unintuitive to require the author to repeat the same itemtype again, and I don't expect most authors using the vCard vocabulary will remember that

[01:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: no what i'm saying is that md-vcard, if it wants to work with rdf, should require that the adr types have their own types

[01:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
different than the vcard type

[01:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
since they're not vcards but addresses

[01:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
but they're part of the same vcard vocabulary

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
only to the same extent that the "reload()" method on the Location object is part of the Window object

[01:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
so, if an author doesn't care about the RDF conversion, can they get away without using an explicit itemtype, and still express the semantics they want?

[01:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure, that's what md-vcard does

[01:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. It still seems weird that the semantics that are expressable through md-vcard, can't be mapped to RDF in a sane way by default

[01:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
they could, just not using the vocabulary-agnostic rdf conversion algorithm

[01:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
even the work vocabulary can't really be converted naively -- you have to apply extra rules to get it into its "proper" RDF form

[01:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
(those rules are actually provided, though)

[01:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
a lot of this is a result of RDF's complexity

[01:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. using URLs everywhere

[01:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose we _could_ automatically map the adr properties to URLs by concatenating the "path" to the property

[01:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, no, that wouldn't work

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
there'd be no way to guarantee uniqueness

[01:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
(if the above doesn't make much sense to people reading archives, it's because i wasn't very eloquent.)

[02:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
"a proprietary raid-like solution for redundancy" - can you still get read access to your data without relying on a proprietary solution, e.g. if your Drobo hardware dies and nobody manufactures them any more?

[02:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: no

[02:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: but i have two, so if one dies i'm ok

[02:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
if both die i'm screwed

[02:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
(if both die after drobo stop making them, that is)

[02:28:00.0000] <danbri>
WHATWG: HTML5: Mention that you shouldn't dereference an item type URL. http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=4613&to=4614

[02:29:00.0000] <danbri>
are those microdata item times, or more general?

[02:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
it refers to the value of the microdata itemtype="" property

[02:31:00.0000] <danbri>
is that an attribute where i might put things like foaf:Person, if my item was describing a person?

[02:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
more or less, yes

[02:31:02.0000] <danbri>
i think it's fine to say the design doesn't *require* derferencing, ... but to forbid it seems rather strong

[02:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
the exact text doesn't forbid it

[02:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
it is more subtle than the checkin comment

[02:32:02.0000] <danbri>
/me was reading the link

[02:32:03.0000] <danbri>
it has an '...in order to determine how to process'

[02:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
right

[02:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's just an opaque string, unless you know it isn't

[02:33:01.0000] <danbri>
but one way of knowing more about it is to read a document from the Web

[02:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure, a human is allowed to do whatever

[02:33:03.0000] <Hixie>
humans aren't one of the spec's conformance classes

[02:33:04.0000] <danbri>
and software that human has installed? 

[02:34:00.0000] <danbri>
can it not have a mode that includes lookups?

[02:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
can you give a more concrete example?

[02:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not sure what you mean by "includes lookups"

[02:34:03.0000] <danbri>
again, it should be optional rather than mandatory ... not requiring schema downloads was one of the original rdf requirements

[02:35:00.0000] <danbri>
ok, you load the class definition, and realise it's a subclass of one you have some built-in UI widget to display ... so the user gets a slightly prettier ui

[02:35:01.0000] <danbri>
eg. doap:Project says it is subclass of foaf:Project, and you had a layout hardcoded for projects, keyed off the foaf:Project uri

[02:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
class definition?

[02:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
microdata doesn't have class definitions

[02:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
microdata isn't really intended for the use cases than need RDF and all the schemas and reasoning and all that, to be honest

[02:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
for that people should just use RDF

[02:39:00.0000] <danbri>
it's not fancypants reasoning

[02:39:01.0000] <danbri>
just matching some triples from a different doc

[02:39:02.0000] <danbri>
but microdata is the syntax; what user apps do with it isn't your concern

[02:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
sounds pretty fancy to me if it's applying UIs to subclassed vocabularies through some sort of automated definition mechanism :-)

[02:39:04.0000] <Hixie>
what user apps do with it is my only concern, the syntax is just a means to that end

[02:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
actually i'd go even further

[02:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
what _users_ do with it is my only concern

[02:40:02.0000] <danbri>
well, i'm not too worried about that rule in the spec; folk will just ignore it if they want to

[02:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
the user apps and syntax are _both_ just a means to that end

[02:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
they can ignore anything they like if they don't want to follow the spec :-)

[02:40:05.0000] <Hixie>
not much i can do about people who don't want to follow the spec

[02:40:06.0000] <danbri>
wouldn't be the first time!

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, time for bed

[02:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[02:41:02.0000] <danbri>
gnite!

[02:41:03.0000] <danbri>
/me time for elevensies

[05:56:00.0000] <cyberix>
Could html5 help this guy?

[05:56:01.0000] <cyberix>
http://benfirshman.com/projects/jsnes/

[05:56:02.0000] <cyberix>
he did some programming in js

[05:57:00.0000] <cyberix>
and figured out he needed a small flash application to read the sound from his js and forward it to the speakers

[05:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
It ought to be possible with <audio> and data: URLs

[05:57:02.0000] <cyberix>
he mentions that at the bottom of the screen

[05:59:00.0000] <cyberix>
so he should generate 1 second of sound and add it to the site with an audio tag

[05:59:01.0000] <cyberix>
then generate another 1 second of sound and then add that exactly when the first one stops playing

[06:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's not very elegant or good but it might roughly work

[06:01:00.0000] <cyberix>
You do realize that if there is even a tiny gap, you will then hear it once a second

[06:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[06:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
which is why it's not very good

[06:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
soo... what happened to &lang; and &rang;?

[06:02:03.0000] <Philip`>
There have been discussions about making some kind of audio equivalent to <canvas>, but they haven't got very far yet

[06:02:04.0000] <hsivonen>
did both MathML and HTML5 change what those mean?

[06:05:00.0000] <cyberix>
Would it be possible to add a <audio generator="soundgen"> to the spec, where soundgen would be a js function returning a tiny chunk of sound, and would be called in a loop by the browser?

[06:06:00.0000] <cyberix>
also, what is the best way of contacting the folks who discus the audio element?

[06:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
cyberix: hi

[06:07:01.0000] <cyberix>
hsivonen: hello

[06:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: are we sure this rang/lang stuff is solving Real Problems?

[06:09:00.0000] <Lachy>
cyberix, that doesn't seem like a very optimal design

[06:09:01.0000] <cyberix>
Lachy: Why?

[06:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, for starters, it's not clear what exactly the file pointed to by soundgen would actually do to make the sound.

[06:10:01.0000] <cyberix>
no file

[06:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
cyberix: so the sound needs to be continuous to an arbitrary length?

[06:11:00.0000] <cyberix>
yes

[06:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/file/function/

[06:11:02.0000] <hsivonen>
cyberix: can't do that with HTML5

[06:11:03.0000] <hsivonen>
cyberix: we don't have an audio canvas or "WebAL" yet :-(

[06:11:04.0000] <cyberix>
bugger

[06:11:05.0000] <hsivonen>
cyberix: you aren't the first one to ask for it

[06:11:06.0000] <Philip`>
We don't even have a way of storing binary data

[06:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
(in JS)

[06:12:01.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: I understood you could use a latin-1 string, list of integers, or data url

[06:12:02.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: Any of those seems ok to me

[06:13:00.0000] <cyberix>
Lachy: the function should be able to do anything to produce the sound. That is the point of it

[06:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
cyberix, you haven't given any indication about what the API itself would look like

[06:14:01.0000] <Lachy>
or would it just create the sound from the function's return value or something?

[06:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
Iif so, that seems very limiting)

[06:15:01.0000] <cyberix>
Lachy: the functions return value would be sound

[06:15:02.0000] <cyberix>
Lachy: it is the opposite of limiting

[06:15:03.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't know if push or pull APIs would be better

[06:15:04.0000] <Philip`>
Pull seems harder for browsers to handle nicely, since they don't know how long the function is going to take or how much sound it's going to return, so they don't know how early to call it

[06:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
so then it would have to generate the entire sound all at once, and return it as a single value in some undefined format?

[06:16:01.0000] <cyberix>
Lachy: no, it would return a chunk of sound

[06:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
whereas the script running in the page should have a better idea of those things, and of how much latency is acceptable

[06:16:03.0000] <Lachy>
push seems like a much more reasonable approach, and is more in line with how canvas works

[06:16:04.0000] <hsivonen>
argh. the rang/lang stuff is in http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/#diff-xhtml1

[06:16:05.0000] <cyberix>
Lachy: and the browser would call it again to retrieve more

[06:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
changing rang/lang sucks for roundtripping

[06:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, but what format would it be requried to return? Would script authors be required to generate binary PCM data or something?

[06:17:02.0000] <cyberix>
Lachy: PCM would probably be good

[06:17:03.0000] <hsivonen>
if you serialize to &LeftAngleBracket; &RightAngleBracket;, the result is round-trip-incompatible with old HTML parsers

[06:17:04.0000] <Lachy>
that would be very complicated. I wouldn't expect most authors to be able to write a script that can generate sound and output PCM data.

[06:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
If they can't write a script to generate sound then they're just not going to use this scripted-sound-generating feature

[06:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
if you serialize the new characters to &rang; and &lang;, you are incompatible with old MathML stuff

[06:18:02.0000] <cyberix>
Lachy: Currently the authors create PCM, store it in some variable, set flash to read that variable and play the sound

[06:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
If they can, I don't know what alternatives to PCM data would be better

[06:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
cyberix, the pull approach you're suggesting also seems to be unable to handle cases where sonds are generated in response to user interaction. It would be much simpler if, say, a click handler could invoke some sound generating methods when they want the sound

[06:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Serialise to &#x27e8; then?

[06:19:03.0000] <Lachy>
and then the browser can then asynchrounosly produce that sound

[06:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dammit, Philip`, beat me to it.

[06:21:00.0000] <cyberix>
Lachy: you would have a click handler mix the sound of click to the buffer that gets returned on next call to the sound generator

[06:22:00.0000] <cyberix>
But push might be easier, I agree

[06:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
cyberix, so would the browser be constantly polling the function to check for new sound?

[06:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
That seems very inefficient

[06:22:03.0000] <cyberix>
yes

[06:22:04.0000] <cyberix>
it is not inefficent

[06:22:05.0000] <cyberix>
because

[06:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
the browser is wasting many cycles checking for new sound, running that function over and over again. How is that not inefficient?

[06:23:01.0000] <cyberix>
it makes sure you are only polling one sound at all times

[06:23:02.0000] <cyberix>
with push you might end up pushing multiple sounds at the same time

[06:24:00.0000] <cyberix>
ofcourse you don't do polling when the function has not been defined

[06:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
If you're dynamically generating sound, you're probably making a game and it's doing setInterval(updateFrame, 0) so you're already using up as many CPU cycles as you can, and it doesn't matter if a few more are spent on sound

[06:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: well, this &rang;/&lang; stuff is going to take way more of my time than I'd like

[06:24:03.0000] <cyberix>
I guess Lachy is worried about generating silence eating up lots of resources

[06:25:00.0000] <cyberix>
however most of the time you would not be using this callback to generate silence

[06:25:01.0000] <cyberix>
you'd rather not use sound output at all

[06:25:02.0000] <Lachy>
why does it matter if multiple sounds are pushed to it? Depending on how the API is defined to work, they can either play sequentially, or be multiplexed and output together.

[06:26:00.0000] <cyberix>
anyway

[06:26:01.0000] <cyberix>
We have been looking at different APIs on desktop side

[06:27:00.0000] <cyberix>
it seems everyone uses push

[06:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
all I'm saying is that it makes much more sense for the API to be something like audio.synthesizeSound(...); and have it play immediately, rather than having the polling method just waiting for something to be returned

[06:27:02.0000] <cyberix>
except for JACK

[06:27:03.0000] <cyberix>
whose developers say push is not a good idea because at the bottom you always have the sound device that is pull

[06:28:00.0000] <cyberix>
and you can implement push on top of pull easier than the other way around

[06:28:01.0000] <cyberix>
however JACK is really realtime critical

[06:28:02.0000] <cyberix>
if some process doesn't return the sound to it in time, it will kick the process out

[06:28:03.0000] <cyberix>
"no more sound for you"

[06:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
JACK seems to have different requirements to most normal audio systems, where it doesn't matter so much if there's a glitch and you lose a few milliseconds

[06:29:01.0000] <hsivonen>
aaargh. the difference in length between lang and LeftAngleBracket changes line wrapping, too

[06:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
Doing anything real-time based on JavaScript seems like a futile idea :-)

[06:30:00.0000] <cyberix>
so push is probably the way to go then

[06:30:01.0000] <cyberix>
and there should probably be just one channel out

[06:30:02.0000] <cyberix>
stereo

[06:30:03.0000] <cyberix>
if you want mixing, do it yourself

[06:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
but stereo is 2 channels

[06:31:01.0000] <cyberix>
one stereo channel

[06:31:02.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose it'd be nice to be extensible so we can do surround-sound output in the far future

[06:31:03.0000] <cyberix>
We also looked at this

[06:31:04.0000] <cyberix>
the conclusion was

[06:31:05.0000] <Philip`>
(rather than hard-coding the stereo assumption)

[06:31:06.0000] <cyberix>
there is no way to extend stereo into being surround

[06:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
and we'd probably want to design the API to be flexible enough to handle multiple channels, even if the first version of the API only supports L and R

[06:32:01.0000] <cyberix>
surround is something completely different

[06:32:02.0000] <cyberix>
it doesn't need to be part of the same API

[06:32:03.0000] <cyberix>
if you do that in future, you may as well define a new API

[06:32:04.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose it'd be nice to support mono for e.g. iPhone applications where you don't care much about audio quality and do care about processing time

[06:32:05.0000] <cyberix>
We also thought about that

[06:33:00.0000] <cyberix>
a function returning sound returns a pair of channels

[06:33:01.0000] <cyberix>
so ([3,5,3,7],[3,7,3,1])

[06:33:02.0000] <cyberix>
(left,right)

[06:33:03.0000] <cyberix>
if you want to save cpu and do mono

[06:33:04.0000] <cyberix>
just have the same reference on both sides

[06:34:00.0000] <cyberix>
the API can still be stereo

[06:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
do the numbers in those arrays just represent frequencies or something?

[06:34:02.0000] <Philip`>
That sounds quite sensible

[06:34:03.0000] <cyberix>
Lachy: yes, in no particular format

[06:34:04.0000] <cyberix>
so that would be four frames of stereo sound

[06:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
though I expect it'd be hard for browsers to optimise that case, so they'd still treat it as two independent channels and decode each number twice

[06:35:01.0000] <cyberix>
the reason why we want to have only one stereo channel going out is

[06:35:02.0000] <cyberix>
that otherwise people will expect us to implement ways of synchronising mixing

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Perhaps you'd want something similar to the canvas ImageData / WebGL typed arrays so it's much faster to transfer lists of numbers from JS to native code

[06:37:00.0000] <cyberix>
what does native code mean?

[06:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
C++

[06:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
(or C or whatever)

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
where the browser converts the JS data into a format suitable for the platform's audio API

[06:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
/me is reminded of the sound function in Logo, which, IIRC, accepted a frequency in Hz and outputt the tone.

[06:38:02.0000] <cyberix>
I'm not sure I understand, but I think this is implementation specific

[06:39:00.0000] <cyberix>
I've been working with a sound generator library called libkunquat

[06:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's not just implementation specific - if I can write playAudioData([1,2,1,-1]) then I could also make an array object with a getter function for the '3' property that does something crazy, and implementations will have to be slow to cope with that situation

[06:39:02.0000] <cyberix>
the api for reading sound is

[06:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
whereas it's easier if they take a more restricted type of array object than the plain JS Array

mix(int frames,int resolution) -> ([float],[float])

[06:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What are the use-cases for <datalist> being an actual element rather than just a JS API?  The only use-case I can think of for it is auto-suggest features, and a JS-only API would be much more convenient for that.

[06:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://24ways.org/2009/real-fonts-and-rendering 

[06:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is the idea that you might want to have some fixed list of auto-suggestions decided at page serve time?  Why?

[06:41:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Apparently using the OS font renderer now counts as doing its own thing

[06:41:04.0000] <cyberix>
so what I would do is while(True){var buffer=mix(5,44100); jsplay(buffer);}

[06:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: That page scrolls really very slowly in Opera :-(

[06:42:01.0000] <adactio>
AryehGregor: the way I see it, datalist is an example of a common scripted solution that is moving to being declarative ...just like most of the new input types.

[06:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: probably thanks to the translucent border along the view port edges

[06:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
adactio, but what's it a solution *to*?  Usually you want to provide autosuggest dynamically based on what the user has typed so far.

[06:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why would you want non-scripted autosuggest?

[06:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: for the same reason the combobox widget exists on desktop

[06:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's a combobox widget?

[06:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(Wow, loading http://about.validator.nu/ in WebKit is a pretty good argument against using web fonts right now.)

[06:45:00.0000] <zcorpan>
AryehGregor: or a good argument against using webkit :P

[06:46:00.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: So what you mean with soundcanvas is a special datatype for storing wavs, and editing them?

[06:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
zcorpan, authors don't get to make those arguments very effectively.  :)

[06:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: yeah, I'm failing so far at convincing the WebKit team to fix this

[06:48:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, Opera has some support for datalist now?

[06:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Have had for ages

[06:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting, I'll have to try it.

[06:48:03.0000] <Philip`>
cyberix: I mean something kind of like https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/doc/spec/WebGL-spec.html#5.14.3.10 as just a more efficient alternative to Arrays (since I assume efficiency is important here)

[06:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: I think the support is limited to the parser though, I don't think we support any more.

[06:49:01.0000] <Philip`>
cyberix: (Ideally those types wouldn't be WebGL-specific - I think the current vague plan is to make them more universal)

[06:49:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, oh, so it's not supported practically speaking?

[06:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, it seems to work.

[06:50:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Neat.

[06:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't know

[06:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm still not sure why you'd want it static.

[06:51:02.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: Does the API for 2d-picture canvas take only WebGL structures, or does it take simple inefficient js as well?

[06:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Ah, it doesn't exist in 10.50

[06:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Apart from in the parser.

[06:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, works for me in 10.10 . . .

[06:52:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, removed in 2.4

[06:52:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
data:text/html,<!doctype html><form><input list="mylist"></form><datalist id="mylist"><option value="foo"><option value="bar"></datalist>

[06:52:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why removed?

[06:52:06.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: also, there is no such thing as sound accelerator cards.

[06:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Dropped from spec

[06:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . .

[06:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-button-element.html#the-datalist-element

[06:53:03.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: And operating with the regular java-script should be efficient

[06:53:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/common-input-element-attributes.html#attr-input-list

[06:53:05.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: If it is not, we should improve that instead of making a special data type

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
cyberix: The 2D canvas API has the same kind of thing, for putImageData - you can't pass in arbitrary JS objects, you have to construct one with createImageData and fill in the array (which is defined to clamp values that you insert, so it can be implemented as an 8-bit buffer)

[06:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Oh, I'm thionking of datagrid

[06:56:01.0000] <cyberix>
that might make sense for the time being

[06:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: And if I actually read the bug, we removed support for external @data providers on datalist, form, and select.

[06:57:01.0000] <cyberix>
however I do not consider it important

[06:57:02.0000] <cyberix>
it would be more important to get an API in first place

[06:57:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, does the data URL I gave above work in 10.50 or not?

[06:57:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It works in 10.10.

[06:57:05.0000] <cyberix>
so people could thell us what is wrong with thwm

[06:57:06.0000] <cyberix>
them

[06:57:07.0000] <Philip`>
cyberix: Yeah, it's probably not the biggest concern

[06:57:08.0000] <cyberix>
instead of writing hacks in flash

[06:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: yes

[06:58:01.0000] <cyberix>
However

[06:58:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, okay, great.

[06:58:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe I'll implement that for MW search suggest.

[06:58:04.0000] <cyberix>
if it is going to be push

[06:58:05.0000] <cyberix>
it requires no support from the html document

[06:58:06.0000] <cyberix>
does html5 specify such things at all?

[06:59:00.0000] <cyberix>
global js functions that you can call from anywhere

[07:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure, any function in the global namespace.

[07:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<script>function foo(){}</script>

[07:00:02.0000] <cyberix>
Give me an example, so I can look it up in the spec

[07:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
cyberix: I assume you mean functions that the spec defines, which can be called from anywhere?

[07:01:01.0000] <Philip`>
See e.g. http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/browsers.html#the-window-object for lots

[07:04:00.0000] <cyberix>
I just realized we should probably have one player for each frame

[07:05:00.0000] <cyberix>
which means that, eventually one guy is going to code a drum machine, and another guy is going to code a synth

[07:05:01.0000] <cyberix>
and they will come to us asking how they can synchronize them

[07:05:02.0000] <cyberix>
even though they run in different frames

[07:08:00.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: Should probably think this trough

[07:09:00.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: However now I'm off to write my thesis

[07:09:01.0000] <cyberix>
have fun

[07:09:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me should probably do the same, eventually

[07:09:03.0000] <cyberix>
:-)

[07:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  I'm wondering if it's worth it to figure out how to use Strawberry Perl on my desktop, or if I should just throw the perl up on my server and run it there instead.

[07:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's Strawberry Perl?

[07:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
apparently a good windows distribution of perl?

[07:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.  How about you just use a non-broken OS for your desktop?  :)

[07:16:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Company policy.

[07:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
However, I also can't get this running on my linux server.

[07:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: How I run teh codez? (for font-optimizer)

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: First, you download it

[07:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Then, you run it

[07:20:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
These instructions are useless lies.

[07:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
Couldn't be simpler :-)

[07:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Do you have a specific problem with it?

[07:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.  It keeps claiming that it can't find Font/TTF/Font.pm

[07:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which would probably be because there is no Font/TTF in the archive i downloaded.

[07:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
It should be in the ext directory

[07:25:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed, I have found it buried deep within.

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
ext/Font-TTF/lib

[07:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
and subset.pl says: use lib 'ext/Font-TTF/lib';

[07:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
so it should find that file

[07:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It did not.  I was able to drop TTF into the Font folder in one of the spots in my @INC path, though, and it worked.

[07:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
You shouldn't have to do that

[07:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
and you shouldn't do that because you'll forget to update it if the code's ever updated

[07:30:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Shrug.  I dunno what to tell you.  I r noobz at perl.

[07:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
How do I delete an element from a document using DOM methods?

[07:37:00.0000] <peol>
elem.removeChild(child)

[07:37:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So elem.parentNode.removeChild( elem )?

[07:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That seems roundabout.

[07:38:00.0000] <peol>
https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Node.removeChild

[07:38:01.0000] <peol>
also, ##javascript

[07:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: Yeah, somewhat. Although having elem.removeFromParent seems somewhat unnecessary

[07:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why not just elem.remove()?

[07:40:02.0000] <jgraham>
I would expect that to remove a child

[07:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Weird.

[07:40:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Not if it had zero arguments

[07:41:00.0000] <jgraham>
(in the absence of other clues, like a removeChild method)

[07:41:01.0000] <Dashiva>
How about document.removeNode(node) then?

[07:41:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Hum, no, wouldn't work outside documents

[07:41:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Only works on children of that node

[07:41:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me realizes that was dumb, and that he should pasy attention

[07:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
A dumb comment to a dumb suggestions seems par for the course :)

[07:42:01.0000] <jgraham>
Yes you do look pasty

[07:42:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me looks blankly at jgraham over his monitor

[07:42:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me assumes that was a freudian slip

[07:42:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me slouches back below his monitor

[07:42:05.0000] <jgraham>
For some loose definiton of "freudian"

[07:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
That doesn't necessarially imply horses, penis envy, or wanting to sleep with your mother

[07:43:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The "white male with strong opinions" definition? :)

[07:43:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me shakes head at James...

[07:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
You would just mention _those_ bits of Freud's work.

[07:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
What, the famous bits?

[07:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, yes.

[07:44:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I wasn't aware of the horses

[07:45:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me gets his education from pop songs

[07:45:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me gets his education from Wikipedia

[07:45:02.0000] <jgraham>
(in this case "Judy and the Dream of Horses")

[07:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder ponies have horse envy

[07:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me gets his education from IRC

[07:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: How did you learn about IRC?

[07:48:01.0000] <workmad3>
ah, freud, probably the most prolific and influential case of experimental bias ever :)

[07:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: I don't remember

[07:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
That experience is lost in the mists of time

[07:51:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe you were born here

[07:51:03.0000] <Philip`>
For all I know, I could have learnt it from IRC

[07:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe his future self will learn about time travel from IRC and teach his past self about IRC

[08:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa! Since when has Apple been shipping a DejaVu derivative font called Menlo?

[08:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
new in Snow Leopard?

[08:11:00.0000] <daedb>
hsivonen: http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/06/font-changes-coming-to-mac-os-x-snow-leopard.ars

[08:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
daedb: thanks

[08:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
daedb: thanks

[08:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the new characters for &lang; and &rang; have a much worse real-world font situation than the old ones

[12:44:00.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: I don't think we need binary buffers for sound

[12:45:00.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: I just ate lunch with the main Kunquat developer, and we discussed the matter

[12:45:01.0000] <cyberix>
Even while coding C it is just typical to use float arrays to represent sound

[12:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
cyberix: I think the problem is that in JS (in some (all?) implementations), a float is a garbage-collected heap-allocated object

[12:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
which is a lot of overhead, when you have a hundred thousand of them per second

[12:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
(compared to a specialised array with a 4-byte-per-element backing store)

[12:56:00.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: It'd the be job for the js engine writers to improve it

[12:57:00.0000] <cyberix>
then

[12:57:01.0000] <cyberix>
I don't think it is going to block anything

[12:57:02.0000] <cyberix>
it is just going to consume lots of resources

[12:57:03.0000] <cyberix>
that is ok

[12:57:04.0000] <cyberix>
there is always two options for that kind of problem

[12:57:05.0000] <cyberix>
one is to buy a more expensive computer

[12:58:00.0000] <cyberix>
and the other is to improve js

[12:58:01.0000] <cyberix>
:-)

[12:58:02.0000] <cyberix>
I think canvas uses this funny type because it can then access graphics acceleration

[12:58:03.0000] <cyberix>
standards like opengl define operations on graphics

[12:59:00.0000] <cyberix>
it is then easy to take that set of operations and reveal it to the use

[12:59:01.0000] <cyberix>
user

[12:59:02.0000] <cyberix>
in sound such a standard set of operations has not been defined

[13:00:00.0000] <cyberix>
and trying to do it on demand would probably not lead to very good results

[13:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
cyberix: Yeah, this probably isn't an important point

[13:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
The best approach is likely to be to list and describe use cases, and come up with an initial design, and get interest from implementors, and then iterate on the design

[13:08:00.0000] <cyberix>
If a page has frames

[13:08:01.0000] <cyberix>
do those frames have a Windows object?

[13:08:02.0000] <cyberix>
-s

[13:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Every browsing context has its own Window object, and every page and frame and <iframe> and <object> etc has its own browsing context, if I remember correctly

[13:09:01.0000] <cyberix>
ok

[13:11:00.0000] <cyberix>
in that case we are talking about a function  Window.outputSound([[float],[float]])

[13:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it'd be better to add new API onto a new object, rather than cluttering up the existing ones, like how HTML5 originally had no <audio> element (I think) and you did "new Audio()" then called methods on it

[13:11:02.0000] <Philip`>
since it's likely to end up with lots of methods and properties

[13:12:00.0000] <cyberix>
I couldn't come up with any other method, but I'm still a wee bit unsure about, if the amplitude should be fixed to 48KHz

[13:12:01.0000] <karlushi>
hmm funny bug, a javascript program with a line like "//@boo = foo;" is interpreted in IE6, 7, and 8. wonder what's happening

[13:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
karlushi: Conditional comments, probably

[13:13:00.0000] <cyberix>
in any case there is probably not going to be an html element for this thing

[13:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
karlushi: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_comment#Conditional_Comment_in_JScript etc

[13:14:01.0000] <cyberix>
unless someone thinks this belongs to the audio element

[13:14:02.0000] <karlushi>
Philip`, thanks !!!

[13:18:00.0000] <cyberix>
Philip`: Do you have any ideas regarding internal buffer size

[13:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
cyberix: I'd imagine different pages might want to make their own tradeoffs of latency vs skip-prevention

[13:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
so they'd prefer widely varying buffer sizes

[13:19:02.0000] <cyberix>
Well do you have any idea on maximum hen

[13:19:03.0000] <cyberix>
then

[13:19:04.0000] <cyberix>
should probably not allow 1GB buffers

[13:19:05.0000] <Philip`>
but it largely depends on the use cases and I don't really know what they are

[13:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't know enough about audio to have any specific suggestions for things like buffer sizes :-)

[13:21:00.0000] <cyberix>
it is ofcourse always better for the software to have a bigger buffer

[13:21:01.0000] <cyberix>
but it might not be good for users to have 1GB web pages

[13:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
cyberix: Using js arrays seems problematic; what happens  if I do a = new Array(100); a[0]= 1.7; a[1]=2.0; a.__defineGetter__(3, function() {return  1}); a[4] = {"valueOf":function() {return 1.3}}; a[99] = "A"

[13:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Possibly it is possible to make the common case performant

[13:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but something like a bytearray might be much simpler)

[13:49:00.0000] <cyberix>
jgraham: I don't get your example. You are accessing a uninitialized value 99?

[14:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
cyberix: Arrays in javascript are just normal objects, more or less

[14:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
In particular they can be sparse; not every index need be defined

[14:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
So in the example I create an arry with length 100, populate the first few index properties with things-that-might-evaluate-to-floats

[14:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
Then leave a bunch of undefined properties ("holes") and populate the last index with a string

[14:09:00.0000] <cyberix>
okay

[14:09:01.0000] <cyberix>
I see now

[14:10:00.0000] <cyberix>
jgraham: So an evil user could try attacking the browser by giving perverted parameters to outputSound()

[14:10:01.0000] <cyberix>
and we need something that is much more restrictive than an array

[14:10:02.0000] <cyberix>
because there is no type signatures

[14:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's not about security, it's about the possibility of users doing crazy things meaning that it's hard for browser to optimise the non-crazy cases

[14:13:01.0000] <cyberix>
oh

[14:13:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/browser/browsers/

[14:13:03.0000] <cyberix>
well users doing crazy things know they are doing crazy things

[14:13:04.0000] <cyberix>
and if the kill the performance by doing so

[14:13:05.0000] <cyberix>
well

[14:13:06.0000] <cyberix>
then they do

[14:13:07.0000] <Philip`>
Browsers don't know users are doing crazy things, so in some cases they have to assume the worst

[14:14:00.0000] <cyberix>
sure

[14:14:01.0000] <cyberix>
Should probably measure this in some way

[14:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
(which means worse performance than if the API is restricted so users can't do crazy things)

[14:14:03.0000] <cyberix>
generating some random floats and mixing them

[14:14:04.0000] <cyberix>
and throwing the result away

[14:14:05.0000] <cyberix>
as fast as possible

[14:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
cyberix: (a good example of a more restricted datatype in javascript is a string; you simply can't do most weird stuff on a string object and have it affect the actual (immutable) character values)

[14:56:00.0000] <aho>
localStorage, what's the limit there? 3mb?

[14:57:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I don't think the spec mandates a limit

[14:57:01.0000] <aho>
hmhm

[14:57:02.0000] <aho>
found this: "The current default on iPhone is 5.0 MB. If your database grows beyond this limit, the user will automatically be asked to allow or deny the size increase. If he allows the increase, the database size limit will be upped to 10.MB"

[14:57:03.0000] <aho>
if it's like this everywhere it would be pretty nice indeed

[14:58:00.0000] <aho>
"User agents may prompt the user when quotas are reached," <- awww... spec says "may" :/

[14:58:01.0000] <aho>
http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-webstorage-20091029/#disk-space

[15:00:00.0000] <virtuelv>
aho: my point is that you can't really rely on being able to store what you want to store

[15:00:01.0000] <aho>
of course

[15:00:02.0000] <aho>
but there should be an option to store more than 3 or 5mb if necessary

[15:01:00.0000] <virtuelv>
there are devices and scenarios where you are going to have less than that, I'm afraid

[15:02:00.0000] <aho>
should be a "should (if possible)" then instead of a weak "may"

[15:02:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I'm really wary of user agent requirements

[15:03:00.0000] <virtuelv>
for user interface, that is

[15:03:01.0000] <virtuelv>
because, mostly users, myself included are:

[15:03:02.0000] <virtuelv>
a) uninterested in being interrupted by housekeeping tasks

[15:03:03.0000] <aho>
if you don't ask (and then don't increase the alotted space)... what then? fail? truncate? both sounds sorta bad if the data is somewhat important to you... even more so if asking/increasing would have been possible

[15:04:00.0000] <virtuelv>
b) Not qualified to answer in such dialogs

[15:06:00.0000] <aho>
flash for example asks... seems to work fine for them

[15:07:00.0000] <virtuelv>
aho: I'm saying that asking the user is never fine

[15:07:01.0000] <virtuelv>
I haven't yet seen flash ask me that

[15:08:00.0000] <aho>
it does if it needs to

[15:08:01.0000] <virtuelv>
and if it did, I'd quickly abandon a web site that required that of me

[15:08:02.0000] <aho>
some games need it

[15:08:03.0000] <aho>
and maybe some bigger flash apps

[15:08:04.0000] <aho>
and you'd abandon something because it takes another whopping 5mb?

[15:08:05.0000] <virtuelv>
if you need that much _data_, webstorage is not it

[15:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
rather better caching

[15:09:01.0000] <aho>
from your... like... 1.5tb hdd? :>

[15:09:02.0000] <virtuelv>
ehm

[15:09:03.0000] <virtuelv>
you are assuming people have 1.5TB

[15:09:04.0000] <aho>
say 100gb

[15:09:05.0000] <aho>
5mb is nothing

[15:10:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the reality is that on other devices than desktop, you're not likely to have 150 MB

[15:10:01.0000] <aho>
now

[15:10:02.0000] <aho>
things change, remember?

[15:10:03.0000] <virtuelv>
no, they don't

[15:10:04.0000] <virtuelv>
feature phones now have 40-80MB of built-in storage

[15:10:05.0000] <aho>
so, back in the 80ies every kiddy ran around with a super computer in their pocket?

[15:10:06.0000] <aho>
<:

[15:10:07.0000] <virtuelv>
and small memory cards

[15:11:00.0000] <virtuelv>
I have a phone that, nominally, has 32GB

[15:11:01.0000] <aho>
ipods started with what? 1gb? and now there are models with 64 or 128gb

[15:12:00.0000] <virtuelv>
when I have filled that with what I actually care about having, such as my GPS turn-by-turn application and my music, I have so little space that I'd be pissed if a browser wasted it

[15:12:01.0000] <aho>
an usb stick with 32mb used to be expensive

[15:12:02.0000] <aho>
now you get 8bg for like 1/10 of the price

[15:13:00.0000] <aho>
stuff like that changes pretty quickly

[15:13:01.0000] <virtuelv>
aho: the cookie size limit hasn't really moved in 15 years

[15:14:00.0000] <aho>
eh... yea... of course

[15:14:01.0000] <virtuelv>
it's either 2, 4 or possibly 5KB

[15:14:02.0000] <aho>
you send em over the wire all the time

[15:14:03.0000] <virtuelv>
and my tubes are 182 times wider than back then

[15:15:00.0000] <aho>
all the time = any f-ing request

[15:15:01.0000] <aho>
e.g. 50 times for one f5

[15:15:02.0000] <virtuelv>
aho: you're missing my point:

[15:15:03.0000] <virtuelv>
5 MB is an ocean of storage

[15:16:00.0000] <aho>
that doesn't mean you will never fill it up

[15:17:00.0000] <aho>
now, imagine you're using some web app which uses that storage to store the things you entered... you enter many things... over many many months... and then it's finally full... what then?

[15:18:00.0000] <aho>
do you really think not asking the user would be nice in this kind of scenario would be a good idea?

[15:18:01.0000] <aho>
- would be a good idea

[15:18:02.0000] <aho>
:>

[15:19:00.0000] <aho>
of course you could store all of that on the server side... but without that you can have a really cheap infrastructure

[15:19:01.0000] <aho>
which is a very nice thing imo

[15:20:00.0000] <aho>
also, offline mode


2010-01-20
[17:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone have any input on the name of the doc="" attribute?

[17:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
body="" was suggested

[17:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems about as reasonable

[17:36:00.0000] <nessy>
I quite like using body - it raises the right expectations IMHO

[17:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[17:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
was considering something like srcbody="" too

[17:45:00.0000] <nessy>
although … if it contains a full html file with header and all, body may be a bit too restrictive

[17:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
srcmarkup=""?

[17:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
srcdata=""?

[17:46:02.0000] <daedb>
contents="" ?

[17:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[17:47:00.0000] <nessy>
it's either html or xhtml, right?

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's likely to be whatever the document is

[17:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
so xml in xhtml, html in text/html

[17:48:00.0000] <nessy>
@webdoc ? @webpage ?

[17:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
question is, in xml, do we want to require the <html xmlns="..."><head><title/></head><body> ... </body></html> boilerplate?

[17:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
if we do, then it's going to be far less useful in xml

[17:48:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's already less useful because XML escaping rules are ridiculous

[17:48:04.0000] <Hixie>
(e.g. you must escape < in attribute values, iirc)

[17:49:00.0000] <daedb>
Could you theoretically put for instance SVG in there?

[17:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
(not to mention that a stray U+FFFF would kill the whole page, etc)

[17:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess

[17:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
what would the use case be?

[17:49:04.0000] <daedb>
I don't know, I haven't really followed the discussion :)

[17:49:05.0000] <Hixie>
the main use case is for blog comments

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
which would mostly expect text/html, possibly with embedded svg or mathml

[17:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
for text/html blogs anyway

[17:50:02.0000] <nessy>
so, if we allow the contents of a body element, only, would that be helpful in avoiding the xml/html choice?

[17:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
xml/html choice?

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
it would affect what we call the attribute

[17:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
don't think it would affect any xml/html issue

[17:53:00.0000] <nessy>
I mean: if we can avoid the need to put the boilerplate in and thus deal with xhtml or html the same way - is that possible?

[17:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
xhtml and html are totally different

[17:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can't treat them the same way

[17:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
(however hard people insist on trying)

[17:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i don't think the boilerplate issue affects that per se

[17:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
what it affects is whether the attribute is really giving the contents of a document's <html:body>, or whether it's giving a full document

[17:55:01.0000] <nessy>
I see

[17:55:02.0000] <nessy>
so you would have a content-type attribute, too?

[17:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
no, it would just be html in text/html docs, and xml in xml docs

[17:56:01.0000] <nessy>
oh! now I get it.

[17:57:00.0000] <nessy>
in that case I would not expect to have to repeat the boilerplate

[17:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
(we don't want to require that non-web xhtml UAs have to include HTML parsers to be XHTML compliant)

[17:57:02.0000] <nessy>
just use @body , I'd say - it's an additional piece of body text to be displayed

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, body and srcbody are the main candidates i think

[17:58:01.0000] <nessy>
in fact, ppl might get the boilerplate wrong if they are required to repeat it - so that would avoid an additional source of errors IMO

[17:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
(having "src" at the front is useful from a language usability point of view)

[17:58:03.0000] <nessy>
yeah, makes sense

[17:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
makes it long, though, and people might think it's a URL

[17:58:05.0000] <Hixie>
language design is hard :-P

[17:59:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah, I was just wondering about that

[17:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
so much easier to reverse engineer mistakes other people have already made :-P

[17:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
instead of having to make one's own

[17:59:03.0000] <nessy>
I know! Tell me about it! I've experimented with so many names for the time-aligned text stuff!

[17:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
yeah! exactly

[18:00:00.0000] <nessy>
why not put an email out with your current state of mind and proposing @body and @srcbody and see what ppl say?

[18:00:01.0000] <nessy>
at the same time propose to avoid the header boilerplate repetition

[18:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
e-mail threads about names are rarely if ever useful

[18:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
they just become big bikeshedding threads

[18:01:02.0000] <nessy>
they will happen anyway, I fear

[18:01:03.0000] <nessy>
better to direct it than to come back as a flame war ;)

[18:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but the more feedback you get on a name, the more people's opinions you eventually have to reject

[18:01:05.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[18:02:00.0000] <nessy>
let others make the arguments on why to reject them ;)

[18:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway we already had that thread last week

[18:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's where body="" came from

[18:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
i think i might just go with body=""

[18:03:00.0000] <nessy>
yeah, though a summary of the reasons and state of thinking is probably good to get everyone on board

[18:03:01.0000] <nessy>
but I agree: if you choose @body and propose that, it has the same effect

[18:19:00.0000] <karlcow>
/me is checking the code source of Nokia Forum http://www.forum.nokia.com/ xml namespaces and rdf in CDATA but text/html http://redbot.org/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forum.nokia.com

[18:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
man describing the conformance criteria for <iframe body=""> is going to be interesting

[23:42:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hsivonen: so I've ported over George's jing issue-35 patch to the validator-nu branch, with some tweaks

[23:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmithX: awesome

[23:43:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I think I will have something ready to send you for review later today

[23:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[23:44:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
what I added was a way for it to distinguish between the case where a there is a choice among the missing attributes/elements, and the case where there's not

[23:44:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
for the case where there's not, it emits a separate error message for each missing attribute/element

[23:45:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
for the case where there's a choice, it emits, e.g., "Element object is missing one or more of the following attributes: data type."

[23:46:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
I realize that for the case where there's only two attributes/elements in the choice, that doesn't make so much sense.

[23:47:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
but I think there are other markup vocabs (DocBook, maybe) that have more complex choice cases than HTML does

[23:48:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
as-is, what George's patch does is that it dumps out a text representation of the required content model

[23:48:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
basically RNC syntax

[23:48:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
but I think for most users that's probably not all that helpful

[23:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
indeed

[23:50:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
so I think the ambiguity of "missing one or more of" is an acceptable tradeoff vs. exposing end users to raw, potentially complex RNC content models

[23:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah

[23:50:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
OK, anyway, I will try to get the patch wrapped up shortly

[23:51:00.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hsivonen: one thing I am not clear on is what the difference is in jing between the "required elements missing" case and what it calls the "unfinished element" case

[23:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
IIRC, unfinished element is a special case of the former

[23:52:01.0000] <MikeSmithX>
but in the v.nu message-emitter, I can see that both cases basically cause the same message to be emitted

[23:52:02.0000] <MikeSmithX>
hsivonen: OK

[23:52:03.0000] <MikeSmithX>
for our purposes, it seems like the can be handled the same

[23:52:04.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmithX: I don't really know why Jing makes the distinction

[23:52:05.0000] <MikeSmithX>
OK

[23:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aaargh. Gecko's HTML serializer can wrap lines inside tags

[00:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i blogged the next chapter of my saga with t-mobile

[00:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
in case anyone cares

[00:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, clearly, you're not supposed to read or try to understand the bills from T-Mobile. You're just supposed to pay them whatever random amount they decide to charge you.

[00:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
should doc="" be parsed as xml in xhtml5?

[00:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I hope not

[00:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
HTMLness bit-dependent behavior for the lose

[00:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
if not, then doc makes html parsing support required

[00:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: theoretical purity or Real Problem? :-)

[00:47:01.0000] <zcorpan>
former

[00:47:02.0000] <zcorpan>
maybe the spec should require both html and xml support

[00:47:03.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: fixable by making doc not required for XHTML5-only UAs

[00:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, why is the HTMLness bit-dependent behaviour bad for this?

[00:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
how does innerHTML work in XHTML5 documents? (does it?)

[00:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: depends on HTMLness bit

[00:48:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: per spec and per Gecko and IIRC WebKit

[00:48:04.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: Opera has nicer behavior but is in minority

[00:48:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I hate varying DOM APIs or markup meaning based on the HTMLness bit, but whether to use the text/html or XML syntax seems one of the cases where it is most justified

[00:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what I hate even more is varying APIs based on quirks mode :-/

[00:49:01.0000] <zcorpan>
opera serializes innerHTML differently in xhtml

[00:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: the problem is that changing one layer of the software stack changes behavior elsewhere

[00:49:03.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: oh. 

[00:49:04.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: but still parses as HTML on setter?

[00:49:05.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: yes

[00:49:06.0000] <hsivonen>
not so nice, then

[00:49:07.0000] <zcorpan>
no, it's completely bogus

[00:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: varying doc is essentially varying a DOM API upon setAttribute()

[00:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose if we do make doc HTMLness bit-dependant, then it would mean that scripts interacting with the attribute may have to vary their behaviour based on whether the document is HTML or XHTML.

[00:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
my thinking is that text/html vs. application/xhtml+xml choice should affect the hop from server to DOM

[00:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but making various other things change behavior, too, doesn't maintain clean layering in theory and in practice makes it harder to change the hop from server to DOM

[00:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: that is a plausible view - but there are DOM APIs that differ which we aren't really free to change, so it seems more valuable to me to keep markup syntax consistency within each serialization

[00:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I wish there were separate APIs for interacting via HTML and XML serializations, so you could pick one explicitly instead of it being based on your MIME type

[00:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: IIRC, this was argued differently when I suggested cloning WebKit's HTMLness bit dependency in XMLSerializer into Gecko

[00:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533897%28VS.85%29.aspx 

[00:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Documentation mention defer in the context of innerHTML

[01:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I think it would be rather confusing if parsing wasn't internally cnsistent within one document

[01:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I think we should have html="..." and xml='...' and the author should use the one that matches the page in order to avoid self-confusion

[01:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: it sucks to change JS library behavior when changing how the DOM gets built

[01:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so JS libs could still use setAttribute("html", "...") on XHTML pages

[01:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Apart from that being really ugly, I would expect people to cargo-cult @xml into html documents and get a world of pain out

[01:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It also seems to crash with being able to only support one of HTML and XHTML

[01:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
In general I don't think that XHTML is a significant enough use case that we should be designing more markup to make it work slightly better

[01:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: in that case, doc='' should parse as HTML also in XHTML docs

[01:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: if the party line is that XHTML isn't significant enough

[01:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
XHTML should be done with proper serialization and stuff, so it seems very simple to use src="data:..." for that

[01:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I believe I said at the time that I would prefer to have separate APIs for getting XML and HTML serializations, instead of yet another switchy one

[01:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: but I don't 100% recall

[01:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: right. so wouldn't it be consistent to want explicitly flagged HTML vs. XML here, too, instead of making doc='...' depend on the HTMLness bit?

[01:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think you wanted to add an explicit way to pick one serialization or the other that struck me as awkard to use and thus I suggested the alternative

[01:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: the direct analogy would be to have both xmlDoc and htmlDoc

[01:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: so that DOM properties would act differently from setAttribute?

[01:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I didn't imply any such difference

[01:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: ah. xmlDoc and htmlDoc look like DOM properties. Did you imply there'd be xml-doc and html-doc content attributes?

[01:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh sure, they could be spelled like that

[01:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(hard for me to remember what is the predominant convention in HTML)

[01:10:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I also don't think it makes any sense to change the defacto behaviour of innerHTML for this rather similar case

[01:10:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not saying it's necessarily the best solution

[01:10:04.0000] <othermaciej>
just that it's the most aligned with my past idea that you referenced

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: why would we dig the hole deeper in this case if we didn't keep digging the hole deeper with XMLSerializer?

[01:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I don't really know what happened with XMLSerializer so I can't defend that

[01:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
But I am more concerned with parsing being consisntent than serializing

[01:15:01.0000] <jgraham>
*consistent

[01:15:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think there was a discussion of making it auto-switch serializations instead of always outputting XML, and hsivonen suggested a possible way to explicitly pick one or the other

[01:15:03.0000] <othermaciej>
for doc, it's definitely parsing that matters

[01:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
For serialiazing with a dedicated serializer API having a switch makes a lot of sense

[01:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't see how serializing is different from setAttribute("html", "...") when it comes to decoupling behavior from how the DOM tree got built

[01:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
doh. setAttribute("doc", "...")

[01:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
decoupling is not the sole relevant consideration here

[01:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that particular decoupling rather

[01:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it just seems odd that embedded inline markup in an XML document would be HTML

[01:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
I think we need to focus on author expectations for this issue, rather than ease of implementation.

[01:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if there were a way to choose explicitly, it might seem less weird that making the choice works in both serializations

[01:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: depends on what your mental model is for the layering of things

[01:18:04.0000] <othermaciej>
thus, the fact that data: URIs don't switch doesn't seem weird

[01:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
because they explicitly use a mime type

[01:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: in my mental model, parsing attribute contents is on a different layer on top of parsing the document proper

[01:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
thus, html-doc="" / xml-doc="" (or just html="" / xml="") would not strike me as even slightly odd

[01:19:03.0000] <Lachy>
maybe we could have a mode attribute to go along with doc, so authors could do <iframe doc="..." docmode="xml">

[01:19:04.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: yeah, but you actually know how the internals work

[01:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: or a type="" attribute...

[01:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: though I am not sure an open-ended set of types is needed

[01:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
Since lots of authors think they're writing XHTML even when they're actually writing text/html, they'd probably pick xml-doc, which would be bad because it's not really what they expect and it will be confusing

[01:20:03.0000] <Lachy>
though, maybe the default such an attribute would have to depend on the serialisation

[01:20:04.0000] <jgraham>
/me is not sure support for xml-inside-html is needed at all

[01:20:05.0000] <othermaciej>
I actually think html="..." might be more clear than doc="..." and doc="..." mode="html" seems unhelpfully more verbose

[01:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: Anne's blog is a potential use case :-)

[01:21:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: In what way?

[01:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
it might be needed if you wanted to embed SVG as XML within HTML in order to make use of XML-only features, like namespaces

[01:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: If people are doing that we should fix the problem that their use cases cannot be met in the HTML serialization

[01:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, I don't think a significant number of people should be doing that

[01:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Lachy: OK so it's probably not a use case worth worrying about

[01:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: Anne's comment processing is XML.

[01:23:02.0000] <zcorpan>
anne's blog is a big hack

[01:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: so if he wanted to sandbox comments, he could emit the comments as XML even though Anne's own content is HTML

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: many parts of the Web are

[01:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Why? I don't understand why one would choose to open oneself up to the pain of using XML just for user generated content

[01:24:02.0000] <Philip`>
People who want to do anything fancy with XML can use src="data:application/xhtml+xml,..." and serialise it properly (as Dashiva said) - the whole point of doc="..." is to make the common case more convenient for authors, and the common case is HTML-in-HTML, and it shouldn't be complexified to cope with edge cases that can already be handled with data:

[01:24:03.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: works as a bozo filter for Anne :-)

[01:24:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`++

[01:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I'm OK with that if doc in XHTML parses as HTML, too

[01:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: I'm OK with XHTML in XHTML people having to use data:

[01:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
what I'm not OK with is doc depending on the HTMLness bit of the host DOM

[01:25:03.0000] <zcorpan>
i'm ok with doc always being parsed as html

[01:25:04.0000] <zcorpan>
i don't like having two attributes

[01:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me doesn't care what happens to it in XHTML because that's not the common case

[01:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I don't really see how your objection is more than theoretical purity given that the htmlness bit already bleeds into innerHTML and it seems more likely to align with author expectations if all markup on a page is parsed in the same way

[01:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
(as long as what happens to it in XHTML doesn't cause the feature to become any more complex in text/html)

[01:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
if you adoptNode an iframe, would doc change interpretation?

[01:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: is the author expectation that if they use XHTML, innerHTML setter in the bowels of a minified JS lib breaks?

[01:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I suppose it has a practical consequence for HTML-to-XHTML/XHTML-to-HTML conversion tools that don't support scripts

[01:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: because it would (I think?) be the first non-scripted leaking of HTMLness

[01:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: In that you would have to parse and reserialize the attribute?

[01:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I guess library authors have to be careful to deal with that or just not support XHTML

[01:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Yes

[01:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
biab

[01:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems like case sensitivity is likely to bite them before innerHTML

[01:31:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: .localName FTW!

[01:31:04.0000] <zcorpan>
no-one uses localName

[01:31:05.0000] <zcorpan>
and localName doesn't work in ie :)

[01:31:06.0000] <hsivonen>
well, once Opera makes their localName compliant, too

[01:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it's on our to-do list but not at the top

[01:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it might have been smarter in retrospect to add innerXML

[01:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or outerXML

[01:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if IE9 has DOM Level 2 as part of the rumored SVG work

[01:32:04.0000] <othermaciej>
whichever makes sense, if any

[01:32:05.0000] <othermaciej>
instead of overloading innerHTML

[01:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: maybe they'll get really excited and implement the SVG uDOM

[01:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
complete with Traits!

[01:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me doesn't know what Traits in uDOM is

[01:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
don't forget SMIL :)

[01:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
wow i now don't have any unread html-related emails

[01:38:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. What's the point of Traits compared to the old HTML way of having real IDL properties for typed reflection of content attributes

[01:38:02.0000] <hsivonen>
NIH?

[01:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: Yes, mark-all-as-read makes that quite easy.

[01:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i'd almost be happy with just paying them whatever random amount they charge me, the problem is they simultaneously charge me different amounts!

[01:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: the HTML way was too simple and convenient

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is T-Mobile the only operator with a network that actually works?

[01:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: also, does the U.S. have virtual operators operating on top of concrete networks?

[01:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
no, but it's the only operator i know of with a no-contract unlimited data plan compatible with the nexus one currently

[01:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
i do not believe there are virtual operators

[01:43:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: that is, can you get on T-Mobile's network by dealing with someone else for billing

[01:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[01:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
dsl has some

[01:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i never understood the idea of virtual operators

[01:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
but anyway

[01:44:04.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like the U.S. has lots of telco regulation to add in order to catch up

[01:44:05.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, the uncertainty principle seems to be applying here. The more you know about the details of the charges, the less you know about what the charges are.

[01:45:00.0000] <workmad3>
ah, the banking uncertainty principle :)

[01:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: seems that way

[01:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: having virtual operators decouples competition on customer service from owning the cell towers

[01:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: doesn't seem to help much with the dsl operators as i understand it

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
you just get more options to choose your crappy service from

[01:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and you get more points of failure

[01:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[01:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I used to have DSL from an operator that didn't own the copper

[01:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
when problems showed up, my realistic recourse was switching to a cable modem

[01:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me is pretty sure his t-mobile account is now correctly set up to have the proper "android data" plan, but the phone can still only get a walled garden TCP/IP network, not the Real Web

[01:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
fortunately, a cable modem works instantly after signing the contract

[01:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
hahahahaha

[01:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
you clearly aren't familiar with US cable modems!

[01:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
cable modems here can even stop working randomly AFTER they were working!

[01:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
for no reason other than the cable operator's billing software randomly decides to cut you off without terminating the billing cycle!

[01:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. what's up with the validator.nu DNS

[01:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I can't believe we're talking about poetry again

[01:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
We have many virtual operators in Australia. There have been problems with this model too, though, since for a long time, Telstra's wholesale division had a monopoly on much of the infrastructure.

[01:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
at least, that was the case with copper phone lines and the Cable and ADSL network points in the exchanges. Not so much with mobile towers.

[01:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oooh now we have next week in html

[01:54:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://blog.whatwg.org/whats-next-in-html-episode-1

[01:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
From HTML+RDFa: "This mechanism should be double-checked against all of the RDFa Javascript implementations to ensure correctness."

[01:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Tail wagging the dog?

[01:57:01.0000] <zcorpan>
seems like a good idea to check against implementations

[01:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: cool to see that RDFa is adopting the HTML5 way of implementations wagging the spec instead of the XHTML2 way of the dog and the tail being separate

[01:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, except there's no real legacy to be concerned with here

[02:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And the implementations aren't exactly time-tested either

[02:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: both good points

[02:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: the whatwg spec should be called "HTML (director's cut)"

[02:02:01.0000] <zcorpan>
or maybe "HTML (editor's split)"

[02:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Editor's split seems more accurate, since the Director might cut it differently

[02:03:01.0000] <zcorpan>
the whatwg doesn't have a Director, does it?

[02:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
good point

[02:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
zcorpan: It is the editor's draft already :P

[02:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can't work out a good way to make <iframe body=""> work for the xml mode. All the options suck. Making it use text/html is bad because it means authors who want to use XML can't get away from text/html. Making it imply the boilerplate, effectively giving it a <body> context, is bad because it means you can't give style sheets, etc, in case you are trying to sandbox something more complicated than a blog comment. making it be just a straight xml doc is bad becaus

[02:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you got cut off at "straight xml doc is bad becaus"

[02:05:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: your comment was cut off at " straight xml doc is bad becaus"

[02:05:01.0000] <zcorpan>
damn

[02:05:02.0000] <Dashiva>
What is the use case for @body? In HTML you can leave out all the boilerplate except doctype and title, and in XHTML you get the boilerplate for free from your serialization setup anyhow

[02:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
...because it means the common case has oodles of boilerplate

[02:08:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The common case is HTML

[02:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
the common case supposing XHTML is being used

[02:08:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Authors who want XML can get away from text/html by not using <iframe doc>

[02:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
just like they'd not use <iframe src=data:text/html,...>

[02:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
if it's a feature text/html authors will want, why won't xml authors want it?

[02:09:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Because they have infrastructure to do it automatically?

[02:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
Dashiva: the use case is mainly CMSes including user-provided comments safely without filtering

[02:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
why would xml authors have the infrastructure but not html authors?

[02:09:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: because there are approximately 2 blogs that have comments and are served as XML

[02:09:06.0000] <Dashiva>
Because XML requires well-formedness

[02:09:07.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: sure, today

[02:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'll turn it around: We shouldn't encourage people making XHTML without proper infrastructure

[02:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
that seems a bit arrogant

[02:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why is "oodles of boilerplate" a problem?

[02:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's only like <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><title/></head><body>...</body></html> a single time in one of your template files

[02:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
and you'll already have that a zillion times in all your other template files

[02:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
and people using XHTML will want to put lots of extra namespace declarations on the <html> and will be unhappy and confused if they can't

[02:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and will want lang and xml:lang on <html> too)

[02:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
(They could wrap the content in a <div> and put attributes there but nobody ever does that)

[02:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
(so it'd be weird and confusing to expect them to do so)

[02:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me goes away

[02:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems kinda stupid to require that they write <iframe doc='&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title/&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;

[02:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
just to get to the point where in text/html you would just write <iframe doc="

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's generated by The Tooling!

[02:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
XML is all about The Toolchain

[02:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The namespaces and other magic attributes are also a good point

[02:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, you guys are really against helping out xml authors

[02:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How is it help?

[02:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not against helping them, but not giving them the stuff they usually like to hang NS decls on doesn't look like helping to me

[02:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
not all people who will one day use xml are TAG members

[02:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
some are realy web authors

[02:23:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Helping them generate non-wellformed content?

[02:23:05.0000] <Hixie>
s/y//

[02:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Well some are TAG members, some are HTMLWG chairs and some are high energy physicists

[02:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is anyone all three?

[02:29:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think any of the chairs are physicists

[02:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(So we don't have to check the TAG)

[02:30:01.0000] <othermaciej>
then 2 would be the maximal overlap

[02:30:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but wait, should we count past and/or future chairs?

[02:31:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Future is a bit iffy

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why the "applicable specifications" stuff is so hard for people to understand

[02:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's just a description of what has always been the case

[02:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
did people just not realise that's what was going on?

[02:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
People seem to think it is magic for some reason

[02:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
most specs do not explicitly allow that other specs can modify them

[02:47:00.0000] <jgraham>
But all specs can effectively be modified by other specs

[02:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the people who are finicky about such things made Modularization

[02:47:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the people who are not just went ahead and defined ad-hoc extension specs without permission from the spec being extended

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
HTTP isn't "modular" but people extended that and nobody seems to have a problem with the concept

[02:48:01.0000] <Dashiva>
They have a problem with the concept if you tell them about it

[02:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's like half the standards community is living in an orwellian "doublethink" world

[02:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it's explicitly acknowledging the potential for add-on extensions without formally defining an extension point as such that bothers people

[02:49:02.0000] <othermaciej>
though I'm not even sure it's fair to say that

[02:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think there is this idea that either there needs to be a central authority declaring which specs are applicable, or an open-ended extension mechanism where some sort of distributed namespacing allows people to invent extensions with no coordination at all

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
so why are things like WebDAV ok?

[02:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
does the HTTP RFC say anything about other specs defining additional methods?

[02:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
not as far as i know

[02:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(I don't remember)

[02:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know that it "bothers" anyone, I think some people are just confused

[02:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if a number of people are confused it might be a sign that the spec could be more clear

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
wooo, my phone works finally

[02:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i had to get it to rejoin the network to get t-mobile to consider what plans i had set up, i guess

[02:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think what might be confusing is that "applicable specification" sounds like a standardese term of art for getting some sort of official blessing or jumping through some hoop, even though HTML5 itself says no such thing

[02:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
not much i can do if people aren't going to read the spec before getting confused

[03:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
was my explanation about applicable specifications good, or do you think it's just going to cause more confusion?

[03:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
seemed fine to me, but then i don't understand what the confusion is

[03:03:01.0000] <Lachy>
As I understood it, the confusion seemed to be about who or what gave any particular spec the blessing to be an applicable specification.

[03:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
nothing

[03:04:01.0000] <Lachy>
I know that.

[03:04:02.0000] <Lachy>
But there seemed to be an assumption that there would have to be.

[03:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
why?

[03:04:04.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know

[03:04:05.0000] <Lachy>
I'm not the one confused by it. I just tried to explain the situation to those who are.

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't get why it's not obvious, as it apparently has been with specs before

[03:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think with previous specs, if you wanted to validate against HTML + something else, you were obligated to make a DTD or similar that included some or all of HTML

[03:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
at least, that was the expected model

[03:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but now someone could make an HTML5 + MathML 3.0 + SVG 1.1 + Microdata + ARIA validator without making a single schema or DTD including them all

[03:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
It seems pretty weird to tie the abstract notion of conformance to a particuar technology for assessing conformance

[03:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
didn't stop <canvas> from being added

[03:08:03.0000] <othermaciej>
they can just do it

[03:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
or ARIA

[03:08:05.0000] <othermaciej>
sure, and <canvas> didn't validate and no one cared

[03:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
or WF2

[03:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
for ARIA there was the whole detour of pretending to use XML and namespaces and such

[03:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway

[03:09:03.0000] <othermaciej>
you're preaching to the choir

[03:09:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm trying to explain why people might not fully grok the idea

[03:09:05.0000] <othermaciej>
or at least my best guess

[03:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
telling me why they are wrong helps neither me nor them

[03:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
though if you are merely rejecting my guesses as ill-founded, then I will concede your guess is as good as mine

[03:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just confused

[03:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
not trying to say anyone is wrong or anything

[03:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Maybe the difference is that you think conformance is an abstract notion, whereas other people think conformance is what a conformance checker tells you by applying the mechanistic conformance rules that the specification specifies

[03:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ITYM s/specification/DTD/

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
and they don't accept a notion of conformance where you can't even tell whether a document conforms to HTML5 by looking at its bytes, never mind telling whether it conforms to a more complex set of specification documents

[03:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: I'm imagining those hypothetical people would accept any kind of schema language, not just DTD

[03:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
as long as it's one you can feed into a schema checker tool and get a boolean output

[03:32:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And these people are the ones who decided how an XML document is defined?

[03:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
They're not the same people who decided to hard-code DTDs into XML (or they're the same people but in the future, where they've realised other schema languages might be better)

[04:08:00.0000] <jre>
othermaciej, hixie: yes, RFC 2616 does allow wextension methods (http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.5.1.1)

[04:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
how about response codes?

[04:15:00.0000] <jre>
Hixie, same thing (http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.6.1.1)

[04:16:00.0000] <jre>
I mean, it's easy to check so I was confused about the confusion over here

[04:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
extension-code doesn't seem to have any semantic meaning defined anywhere

[04:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
or are you saying I could return HTTP/1.1 999 OK and it would be conforming?

[04:18:00.0000] <jre>
according to the ABNF yes

[04:18:01.0000] <jre>
according to the prose in 6.1.1 no

[04:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
so is it conforming or not?

[04:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i can't see anything saying it isn't

[04:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
which seems suboptimal

[04:20:00.0000] <jre_>
"The first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit:"

[04:21:00.0000] <jre_>
...

[04:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
so HTTP/1.1 199 OK is conforming?

[04:21:02.0000] <jre_>
yes

[04:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
that seems... bad?

[04:21:04.0000] <jre_>
why?

[04:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
what does it mean?

[04:21:06.0000] <jre_>
ask the status code registry

[04:22:00.0000] <jre_>
if the recipient doesn't understand it, treat it as 100

[04:22:01.0000] <jre_>
"However, applications MUST understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached."

[04:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
ah, ok, so http uses a registry-based centralised extensibility mechanism

[04:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[04:23:00.0000] <jre>
The question was: does HTTP allow extension methods or status codes, and the answer is "yes". How they are registered is orthogonal.

[04:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Does it allow new classes? E.g. 7xx codes

[04:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just trying to learn about the various extension mechanisms

[04:23:03.0000] <jre>
Dashiva, no

[04:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
maybe what html5 says is rarer than i thought

[04:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
(does anything actually require that extension-codes be registered before they are used?)

[04:24:01.0000] <jre>
not in RFC 2616, the status code registry was introduced later

[04:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
so what does 199 mean if it's not in the registry?

[04:25:00.0000] <jre>
http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2817.html#rfc.section.7.1

[04:25:01.0000] <jre>
it means the same thing as 100 for recipients that don't understand it

[04:25:02.0000] <jre>
so a definition of 199 would need to be consistent with the generic status code 100

[04:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
but no definition need exist before i start using it?

[04:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
per http?

[04:26:02.0000] <Lachy>
Leif's response seems confusing. She seems to be suggesting that putting extensions through the W3C process is good, while at the same time advocating methods for arbitrary extensions that bypass that.

[04:26:03.0000] <jre>
RFC 2817 updates RFC 2616 and requires you to register the code

[04:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh so the lack of requiring a registry was a bug?

[04:27:01.0000] <jre>
if you don't register you are on your own with respect to collisions, nothing new here

[04:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
(where does 2817 actually require that the codes be registered? i can't see that anywhere)

[04:28:00.0000] <jre>
there are extension points that don't even have a registry today, simply because nobody has asked for it yet 

[04:28:01.0000] <jre>
I think range extensions fall into the category

[04:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
seems weird to have extension points that allow arbitrary values without needing them to be defined

[04:28:03.0000] <jre>
you can always write a standards track RFC which updates RFC 2616, and then you're safe (as long as the IESG pays attention)

[04:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
damn, these constant splits are annoying

[04:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
according to discussion in #freenode, it still seems to be a DDoS against the network

[04:49:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't it always?

[04:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it's sometimes a CDoS instead

[04:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but this one is particularly bad against the freenode network cause their system hasn't been updated to prevent it yet. It's caused by some javascript in a web page that sends a POST to the irc.freenode.net:6667 network with dozens IRC commands designed to flood it

[04:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
so whenever anyone inadvertently visits the page, usually linked to by spam comments on slashdot or whatever, their browser basically becomes an IRC spam bot

[04:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why does an IRC server react to HTTP requests?

[04:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
it's what most likely caused Opera's Oslo office to be banned from the freenode network yesterday

[04:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Opera employees spend all their time reading spam comments on Slashdot instead of working?

[04:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: what mechanism allows automated POST to port 6667 for a different origin?

[04:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: form.submit()?

[04:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Tyhat should work

[04:55:01.0000] <jgraham>
*that

[04:55:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yes. The script I was shown yesterday has now disappeared and I don't know where any other copies are being hosted.

[04:55:03.0000] <hsivonen>
does the Web depend on it working for ports other than the http and https defaults?

[04:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
it was basically <form action="http://irc.freenode.net:6667" method="POST"> with a script that filled up a textarea with about a hundred IRC PRVMSG commands commands and submitted it

[04:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
er, I think that's PRIVMSG

[05:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: Yes

[05:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://samsung-sgh-i400-software.epocware.com/es/SlovoEd/Hebrew.html - <form name="login" action="http://g500.penreader.com:8080/paragon_mcd/ecare/index.jsp?submit" method="post">

[05:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
etc, assuming that's what you mean

[05:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: :-(

[05:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems it'd be quite a violation of layering if HTML refused to accept URLs with certain TCP port numbers

[06:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is it intentional that the discussion about "drawfocus()" seems to be talking about something quite different to the spec's drawFocusRing()?

[06:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
since the latter is meant to be something you call for every element that you draw, regardless of whether it's focused or not, and it will only draw if the element is focused

[06:38:01.0000] <Philip`>
but people seem to be talking about some kind of method that you only call on focused elements, or on elements that you want to become focused

[06:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: point worth making on the list!

[06:40:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me didn't even realise the spec had a drawFocusRing method, until half an hour ago

[06:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me didn't realize that a method named drawfoo wouldn't draw

[06:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
if braille and tactile are distinct and speech and audio are distinct, should (fontified) text and image be distinct media?

[11:33:00.0000] <Pure>
Hmm, do we have a generic web design channel?#

[11:37:00.0000] <FireFly>
I think there's a #web

[11:45:00.0000] <Pure>
OOI, is html5 more of an upgrade to js, than to core html?

[11:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
It does both - there's lots of new/fixed stuff in the markup, and lots of new script APIs too

[11:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It doesn't change the JS language, though - that's for the ES5 people to do)

[12:30:00.0000] <rittyan>
hello, who can I ask about documentation of python module html5lib? it is not available on google code hosting

[12:41:00.0000] <rittyan>
specifically, why it returns <None> all the time, whatever html I feed into it

[12:50:00.0000] <rittyan>
ah, its repr is <None> for some reason

[12:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
rittyan: What treebuilder are you using?

[12:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
If it's something like lxml, I guess it's implemented as a native object and can't be repred

[12:54:02.0000] <rittyan>
simpletree, now switched to beatifulsoup, works fine

[12:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
BeautifulSoup is a bit broken and unrecommended

[12:55:01.0000] <rittyan>
what is recommended then? i have no legacy code yet

[12:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
lxml works best, as far as I'm aware

[12:56:01.0000] <rittyan>
hm, okay

[13:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
rittyan: Oh the <None> thing doesn't mean anything went wrong, it's just a relly bad representation for the document root node

[13:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
(but in general I would recommend not using simpletree for anything important)

[13:13:01.0000] <rittyan>
yes, weird repr

[13:13:02.0000] <rittyan>
jgraham: so, lxml?

[13:13:03.0000] <jgraham>
rittyan: That is what I typically use

[13:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
(so it is the bet tested, but also the most complex for various technical reasons)

[13:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
*best

[14:14:00.0000] <dimich>
The dataTransfer being 'Empty' on dragenter and dragover is a security feature. It doesn't even expose the set of mime types of dragged files. How can a page decide whether or not it can accept the drop? Is exposing of mime type a risk?

[14:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, focus rings are not always ugly.

[14:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
Maybe on Linux and Windows they are. But on OS X, normal focus rings are actually quite well designed and look quite nice

[14:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: OS-provided stylings are unlikely to fit well with all the random stylings people will use in their canvases, and the inconsistency will make it ugly (even if it'd look nice with the standard OS widget set and theme)

[14:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
if it's so bad, then authors can draw custom focus rings.

[14:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, re: using HTTP URLs for Microdata itemtype, does it have to be a URL at all? http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-January/024770.html

[14:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
The problem I have with using URLs for this, and for namespaces in general, is that formats will most likely out-last the organisation that created them and assigned the namespace or itemtype URL

[15:06:00.0000] <virtuelv>
WTF is a focus ring in a web context

[15:06:01.0000] <virtuelv>
to me a focus ring is something on a camera lens

[15:06:02.0000] <gavin>
it's the dotted border thing that lets you know what you've tabbed to

[15:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's a ring around something that's focused, as far as I'm aware

[15:07:01.0000] <gavin>
(blue glow on mac)

[15:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me imagines it looking more like the thick blue border in Opera when you shift+arrow onto things, or the thick yellow one in Flash when you tab

[15:07:03.0000] <virtuelv>
focus outline

[15:08:00.0000] <virtuelv>
or focus highlight

[15:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
somewhere we use the term spatnav highlight in Opera

[15:09:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(that's for shift-arrow)

[15:09:02.0000] <virtuelv>
either way, focus ring seems wrong

[15:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Projects/Focus_Ring_Cleanup says focus ring so it doesn't seem an entirely novel term

[15:12:01.0000] <jgraham>
virtuelv: I think it is pretty normal

[15:12:02.0000] <jgraham>
I wish you could twist them to bring other parts of the screen into and out of focus though

[15:12:03.0000] <jgraham>
That would be cool :)

[15:12:04.0000] <Philip`>
/me kind of prefers it when his whole screen is in focus

[15:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's no point reproducing physical bugs like blurring into computers

[15:14:00.0000] <jgraham>
Well it would be more useful than half the effects that actually come with compiz

[15:14:01.0000] <jgraham>
You could use it to make non-focused areas less distracting

[15:14:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me only has one of those effects enabled

[15:15:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me should probably give up trying to justify such a clearly useless idea

[15:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
(the zooming one)

[15:15:02.0000] <Philip`>
and I almost never use it, and most of the time I can't use it anyway because OpenGL breaks after I suspend and resume

[15:15:03.0000] <jgraham>
You only have one of the effects enabled or you only have one thing enabled, total?

[15:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
(I mean presumably you must have other parts of compiz enabled for window management, right?)

[15:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's actually the KDE desktop effects thingy rather than Compiz

[15:16:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me likes the expose-like thing which is confusingly not the one with the expose-like name

[15:16:03.0000] <Philip`>
and I'm not sure how they relate, though they seem kind of similar

[15:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Oh

[15:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me has no idea about KDE :)

[15:18:00.0000] <jgraham>
(although gnome's default compiz UI is rather useless so I have to install the hideously complicated UI instead, which makes me sad)

[15:19:00.0000] <virtuelv>
on that note, I just read an open letter to leica

[15:19:01.0000] <virtuelv>
it was long

[15:19:02.0000] <virtuelv>
and basically told leica to stop sucking and join this millenium


2010-01-21
[16:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
Does anyone understand the problem that might be solved by poetry markup, as being discussed on public-html?

[16:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just can't figure out what user agents could do with the markup that would make it more useful than just using the existing, more general purpose elements.

[17:02:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: I get the impression from LML that Hoffman is concerned with poetry being read aloud differently.

[17:03:00.0000] <webben>
"Prose is in general text with no specific requirements for the presentation of rhythmic or rhymed content. On the contrary the presentation should not pronounce accidental rhythmic or rhymed fragments."

[17:16:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: Not significant, but I think you just missed http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20100121#l-83

[17:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
fwiw, in case anyone was wondering, macbooks aren't waterproof.

[17:18:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: see also http://markmail.org/message/6pxz74sm3zcs4gn3

[17:18:01.0000] <webben>
Hixie: This sounds like wisdom gleaned from bitter experience :(

[17:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah.

[17:20:00.0000] <webben>
Lachy: So: 1) read stuff aloud differently and 2) expose the structure of the poetry itself as visible data.

[17:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Are they water-resistant?

[17:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
what's the threshold?

[17:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
i.e. how much water would they have to resist for the answer to be yes?

[17:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know, but I assume the terms have some conventional meanings.

[17:21:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think "water-resistant" means it will be okay if you take it out in the rain, "waterproof" means it will be okay if you drop it in the bathtub.

[17:21:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Roughly.

[17:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[17:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
well

[17:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
where do you think half a glass of water straight into the keyboard fits in this spectrum?

[17:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
maybe laptops should have depth ratings on them, like watches do

[17:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
"rated up to -1cm below water level"

[17:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
where such depth ratings do not correspond with the actual water depth they are capable of handling.

[17:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
like, e.g. a watch rated at "30m" corresponds to roughly splash resistant from, e.g. a tap while washing hands.

[17:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[17:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, so I think you're supposed to take out the battery and let it dry out?

[17:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Apparently it will often be okay if you give it a few days to fully dry.

[17:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, you have a terminal. Can't you just use the date command for that?

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
the clock in my irssi window gives me CET time :-)

[17:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
but yes, i could have used terminal too

[17:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
i just happened to already have google open

[17:32:03.0000] <Lachy>
is CET the time zone I'm in?

[17:32:04.0000] <Hixie>
is it 02:39 where you are?

[17:32:05.0000] <Lachy>
I'm guessing Central European Time

[17:32:06.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[17:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
then yes

[17:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, maybe you missed this earlier...

[17:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
<Lachy> Hixie, re: using HTTP URLs for Microdata itemtype, does it have to be a URL at all? http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2010-January/024770.html

[17:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
<Lachy> The problem I have with using URLs for this, and for namespaces in general, is that formats will most likely out-last the organisation that created them and assigned the namespace or itemtype URL 

[17:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
what should we use instead? people didn't like the reverse-dns identifiers

[17:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
and urls are what rdf uses already

[17:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
users didn't have any problems dealing with urls in the studies, fwiw

[17:38:03.0000] <Lachy>
I know that, and realise we're stuck with URLs, at least for RDF conversion.

[17:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just don't like the idea of tying widely used metadata formats to one particular organisation.

[17:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
*shrug*

[17:39:02.0000] <Lachy>
and one of the problems that has occured with namespaces is that there's no widely used convention for how the URLs should be structured, so we've ended up with a wide range of confusing, non-memorable URLs

[17:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
which often contain effectively meaningless stuff like the years in the older W3C namespaces

[17:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
e.g. compare http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml, http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom (note the unexpected capital A), http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace

[17:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
so I would prefer that we could come up with a simpler, predictable format for itemtype, which identify the format, without identifying the organisation that happened to define it

[17:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
this is not a battle i want to engage in, but if you can find a solution that i can adopt without having to spend effort defending, i'll happily do so

[17:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I also assume that using a centralised registry won't go down well either, since one of the claimed benefits I've heard for using URLs, is that it piggy backs on top of the existing DNS registry

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
long term i think we need to support URLs anyway, given the volume of vocabularies already using them, and if we have to support _two_ mechanisms, that may be worse than URLs, however good the alternative mechanism

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
which may be an argument for not bothering

[17:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
(it was the argument against reverse-dns -- it just wasn't enough of a gain to be worth it)

[17:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
hmm, ok. That does suck that we have to continue to suffer from the mistakes of RDF and namespaces :-(

[17:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
just like we have to suffer from SVG's design mistakes

[17:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
btw, is there any plan to switch the itemtypes from using n.whatwg.org URLs to W3C URLs, or is the intention just to keep those permanently, regardless of whatever eventually happens with microdata?

[17:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
and just like people in the future will have to deal with ours

[17:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. the storage mutex

[17:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't intend to change anything

[17:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[17:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
of course if the w3c can provide a better URL (-> shorter, memorable) before that one gains usage, then i don't see why we wouldn't use it

[17:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's going to be nice when spammers inevitably take over whatwg.org and start serving ads or even malicious content from those URLs

[17:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish i could renew domains for more than 1 year at a time

[17:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd just renew it for 100 years if i could

[17:53:02.0000] <Lachy>
that depends which provider you register it through

[17:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
dreamhost

[17:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
I thought the maximum permitted by the .com registry was about 10 years

[17:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's already pretty miserly

[17:54:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe DNS won't exist in 100 years, then you wasted your money.

[17:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
but I once saw one registrar use a loophole to allow 100 year registrations, where they would register it for 10 and promise to keep renewing it automatically

[17:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
AryehGregor: it's ok, by then the money would have been worthless anyway :-P

"Already XHTML2 was considered to be too progressive"

[18:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
i really don't think that's the criticism i would level at XHTML2

[18:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe "too progressive" means "trying to make too much progress".

[18:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
XHTML2 was one of the slowest moving specs the W3C has ever worked on, so that doesn't seem like a valid criticism either

[18:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I said trying, not succeeding.

[18:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
As in, it tried to improve HTML as much as possible, even regardless of backward compatibility.

wow - so google is putting HTML5 now into youtube http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/01/introducing-youtube-html5-supported.html

[20:17:01.0000] <cardona507>
very sweet

[20:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder when you can actually enable it (instead of just seeing it on the demo page)

[20:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I would love to be done with using Flash for YouTube...

[20:20:00.0000] <jcranmer>
everyone keeps saying that "oh, theora quality sucks", but people have pointed out that theora outperforms youtube at current quality levels

[20:23:00.0000] <cardona507>
jcranmer - I read Chris DiBona from Google say “If [YouTube] were to switch to Theora and maintain even a semblance of the current YouTube quality it would take up most available bandwidth across the Internet.”

[20:25:00.0000] <cardona507>
othermaciej - I wonder the same - as I am sure you know Youtube has had the sample page up for quite a while - but the announcement from today makes it seem like soon if you are running a modern webkit browser it will just load <video> - I too am waaay over flash for youtube

[20:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
cardona507: it sounded like you could now enable HTML5 mode on all pages, but it looks like all there is for now is a demo page

[20:26:01.0000] <cardona507>
Here is another article from techcrunch that explains it a bit more http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/20/youtube-html5/

[20:27:00.0000] <cardona507>
It sends you to this page to "activate" the feature http://www.youtube.com/testtube

[20:28:00.0000] <cardona507>
but yeah - it only sends me to the original html5 video example page -

[20:28:01.0000] <jcranmer>

oh - nice

[20:29:02.0000] <jcranmer>
theora has comparable quality and comparable bitrates under "standard" arguments

[20:30:00.0000] <cardona507>
What is the main argument against using it then? that it "might" have silent patents?

[20:30:01.0000] <jcranmer>
no hardware decoders was a major reason listed

[20:31:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I suspect that's probably the primary reason Apple and Nokia dug in their heels

[20:32:00.0000] <cardona507>
I am really hoping hoping that google gets a codec from it's potential On2 acquisition and makes it open source - that would be great

[20:36:00.0000] <cardona507>
On an entirely unrelated and unlikely wish- I sure wish that microsoft would scrap Trident and go with Webkit for IE 9 - Hey we can dream can't we?

[20:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think the odds of that are pretty much nil

[20:38:01.0000] <cardona507>
:D 

[20:39:00.0000] <cardona507>
webkit is turning into a defacto standard for modern browsers - especially mobile

[20:39:01.0000] <cardona507>
(as you all know)

[20:40:00.0000] <cardona507>
What are the chances of firefox going with webkit? also nil?

[20:41:00.0000] <jcranmer>
yep

[20:43:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I would be remiss if everyone went to one layout engine

[20:43:01.0000] <cardona507>
I guess an entirely homogenous environment (all modern broswers using webkit) could potentially be a security hazard

[20:43:02.0000] <jcranmer>
it would essentially become an innovation graveyard as ewll

[20:53:00.0000] <Necrathex>
presto 2.5 seems pretty awesome though

[21:00:00.0000] <cardona507>
Necrathex - yeah - I agree - 

[21:01:00.0000] <cardona507>
pretty interesting that opera bought an ad network today

Are there any examples of a basic rails app which syncs offline/online data using HTML5?

[23:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[23:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: ayt?

[23:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I guess you are since you just said something

[23:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
hey

[23:59:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I have a hopefully brief question relating to a WebKit bug

[00:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
someone submitted a patch that would cache the actual NodeList objects returned by getElementsByTagName, getElementsByTagNameNS, getElementsByName, and getElementsByClassName

[00:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so if called on the same node with the same parameter twice, they would return the same value

[00:00:02.0000] <othermaciej>
DOM Level 3 Core seems to explicitly forbid this for gEBTN and gEBTNNS

[00:00:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but for the two specified in HTML5, it does not say one way or the other

[00:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
here is the bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33696

[00:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
my comment links the relevant spec sections: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33696#c17

[00:01:02.0000] <othermaciej>
my question to you is whether HTML5's silence on whether these methods return a new object is meant to intentionally diverge from DOM Core and allow caching, or if it's just an oversight and is actually supposed to match DOM Core

[00:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
the latter

[00:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ok

[00:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
can you file a bug for that?

[00:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I will

[00:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[00:04:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it would be better if DOM 3 Core and HTML5 both allowed caching, but it certainly seems bad for them to differ

[00:04:05.0000] <othermaciej>
so probably the right thing to do is fix it in DOM Core first

[00:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i would rather scripts always get reliably a new object

[00:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
so that they don't start getting non-interoperable behaviour if they're messing with properties on these objects

[00:05:02.0000] <Hixie>
either it should always return the same object or never, imho

[00:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that is indeed somewhat safer to always return a new object

[00:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
it seems like it'd be relatively easy to implement wrappers that make it seem like they're new objects while being mostly the same object internally

[00:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the only reason I was enthused about the caching is that I think setting custom properties on NodeLists is kinda rare, and the performance win seems really big

[00:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that is in fact what we do currently

[00:06:04.0000] <Hixie>
what's most of the win from?

[00:06:05.0000] <Hixie>
is creating JS objects that expensive?

[00:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I believe most of the win is from not allocating the JS-level wrapper, but it's not my patch and I did not do profiling so I can't say for sure

[00:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[00:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
maybe you can do copy-on-write magic or something

[00:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's not really practical to do with JS objects

[00:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
they can easily share all their innards but be different wrappers, and we do that already (essentially)

[00:08:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but you can't have two pointers to the same JS-level wrapper turn different later

[00:08:03.0000] <othermaciej>
so there's no way to avoid doing an allocation on every call with the current requirements

[00:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems like you should be able to add one level of indirection -- one pointer and one bit, in fact -- but i guess the code complexity would be disproportionate

[00:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
and i guess the cost could be prohibitive

[00:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
relative to the win

[00:10:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it's really the fixed overhead of allocating the JS wrapper that I believe is the expensive part, so adding a level of indirection would not help, since the indirect part would have to be allocated as a JS value itself

[00:10:03.0000] <othermaciej>
to work with the GC

[00:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah, yeah

[00:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
surely your JS wrappers are all fixed-size and can be arena allocated really cheaply

[00:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems odd that that would be the expensive bit

[00:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
allocating the actual NodeList, sure

[00:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
GC allocation ain't cheap

[00:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
allocating the C++-level NodeList might be a big part of the cost too, and in theory we can have distinct wrappers for the same C++-level NodeList

[00:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think our caching right now is of an object that's shared by multiple C++ NodeLists

[00:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I can suggest trying that to the contributor and see if returning the same actual JS-level NodeLists still looks like a big win after

[00:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
filed http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8792

[00:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
with the caveat that i am talking out of my nether regions, it seems like getting GC structures to allocate fast would be a good win in general

[00:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i expect you have experts who are better positioned to work out this kind of thing :0)

[00:17:03.0000] <Hixie>

/me poured water on his macbook pro yesterday and has been relegated to an X41

[00:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
what a life

[00:18:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I am sure JSC and V8 have both put a good bit of work into tuning our respective GC allocators

[00:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
there are some fundamental limits

[00:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[00:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
in the case of this test it's not just the allocation, but the fact that you are creating lots of garbage

[00:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
and every garbage JSNodeList needs to have a finalizer

[00:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
makes sense

[00:19:05.0000] <othermaciej>
that will strain any GC algorithm I know of

[00:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway I r-'d the patch for now

[00:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am finding that a lot more WebKit contributors are submitting stuff lately that I have to r- because it directly violates a spec, without apparent compatibility need (or similarly good reason)

[00:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure what to do about this

[00:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
also I am far from the only reviewer so I wonder how much of that sorta thing is slipping through

[00:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not that it's your problem

[00:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i dunno what the solution is

[00:22:03.0000] <Hixie>
what other kind of stuff has there been?

[00:24:00.0000] <othermaciej>
one that I specifically recall is someone submitting a patch to implement HTML5 footer that tried to enforce the content model in the parser

[00:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
i.e. it would actually reparent on an attempt to nest <footer> elements

[00:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh yeah, i saw that one

[00:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
that seems like a pretty fundamental failure to read the spec

[00:24:04.0000] <Hixie>
some of the feedback on the mailing lists has been like that too

[00:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
standards are complex

[00:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
and it can take a while to get up to speed on some of the basic concepts

[00:46:00.0000] <Hixie>

Dashiva: what hsivonen said

[00:55:01.0000] <Dashiva>
But would we have that problem at all if XML hadn't decided against being text/*?

[00:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
ain't just a problem for XML mime types

[00:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>

I even checked that there's really a <video> element in the DOM

[01:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It's a shame they don't support unencumbered formats

[01:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am just amazed that it actually works

[01:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
with the load thermometer and everything

[01:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
now my only reason to use Flash is Flash games

[01:07:00.0000] <erlehmann>
othermaciej, there is a html5 youtube? not only that demo?

[01:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
erlehmann: now you can enable "HTML5 beta" which gives it to you on all their videos

[01:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/01/introducing-youtube-html5-supported.html

[01:07:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(earlier it was only the demo page)

[01:08:00.0000] <Rik`>
othermaciej: you could already use youtube with html5 with clicktoflash in Safari

[01:08:01.0000] <Rik`>
btw, the activation page is pretty bad

[01:08:02.0000] <erlehmann>
i'm shocked and appalled ! thanks

[01:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik`: what's clicktoflash?

[01:09:00.0000] <Rik`>
hsivonen: a Safari plugin similar to flashblock 

[01:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah but I'm not willing to run haxies

[01:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik`: YouTube was also available as HTML5 in Chromium+encumbered ffmpeg and Chrome using some kind of user script

[01:09:03.0000] <Rik`>
hsivonen: http://rentzsch.github.com/clicktoflash/

[01:09:04.0000] <Rik`>
   <p>Right now we support browsers that support both the <video> tag in HTML5 and the h.264 video codec. These include:</p>

[01:10:00.0000] <Rik`>
the <video> tag should be &gt;video&lt;

[01:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik`: whoa. that goes into ~/Library/Internet Plug-ins/

[01:10:02.0000] <erlehmann>
sadly, no theora ;_;

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik`: so it's not an input manager? surely NPAPI doesn't offer enough surface for this

[01:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik`: or does it override Flash's mime registrations or something?

[01:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and hosts Flash inside the other plug-in?

[01:12:01.0000] <Rik`>
I think it overrides the mime registration

[01:13:00.0000] <Rik`>
that's what I understand in http://github.com/rentzsch/clicktoflash/blob/master/Plugin/Info-Plugin.plist

[01:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it steals Flash's MIME registration

[01:13:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it only works because WebKit plugins take priority over NPAPI plugins

[01:13:03.0000] <hsivonen>
people go to great lengths to avoid Flash

[01:14:00.0000] <Rik`>
clicktoflash blocks flash and add a few nice stuffs like html5 on youtube and special treatment for sifr titles

[01:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
we had some people over and one person (a physicist, not a software developer) was praising the virtues of not having Flash but having enough Chromium trickery for watching YouTube videos nonetheless

[01:14:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I wish YouTube would stop telling me to download Chrome on every single page though

[01:15:00.0000] <Rik`>
oh, that doesn't work for embedded videos :(

[01:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
intersting. YouTube shows the Chrome ad in Safari on Mac but not in Minefield on Mac

[01:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ad also shown in Opera

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
leveraging leadership in one service to promote another product, I guess

[01:27:00.0000] <Rik`>
and so I miss a "Go fullscreen" button in Safari

[01:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, from what I can tell, it seems that Minefield does return the same object from subsequent getElementsByTagName calls. (Opera and WebKit don't)

[01:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Cp%3Etest%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cscript%3E%0Avar%20a%20%3D%20document.getElementsByTagName%28%22p%22%29%3B%0Aa.foo%20%3D%20%22FAIL%22%0Avar%20b%20%3D%20document.getElementsByTagName%28%22p%22%29%3B%0Aw%28%22Same%20object%3A%20%22%20%2B%20%28a%20%3D%3D%3D%20b%29%29%3B%0Aw%28%22foo%20property%3A%20%22%20%2B%20b.foo%29%3B%0A%3C%2Fscript%3E%0A

[01:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: ORLY

[01:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: that's a direct violation of DOM Level 3 Core if true

[01:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if it is intentional

[01:36:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: Minefield only, or also release Firefox?

[01:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: doesn't happen in Firefox 3.5.2 for me

[01:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: cannot reproduce

[01:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: in latest Mnefield on Mac

[01:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
oh, I gess the w function is not doing anything

[01:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: seems to be true in Firefox 3.5.2 as well

[01:42:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: not sure whether to file a Firefox bug or r+ the WebKit patch to do the same now...

[01:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure how to find out if this kind of thing is intentional

[01:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
wish there were someone here to ask

[01:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Boris would most likely know

[01:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I did some hg mining but I didn't find anything obviously intentional in the post-3.5 time frame

[01:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: the change already exists in 3.5.2, my initial testing was mitsaken

[01:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/base/src/nsContentList.cpp#221

[01:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: there's a cache whose existence predates the migration to mercurial

[01:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=140758

[01:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if Mozilla is already doing this for a long time and doesn't have resulting problems, then it's likely not a compat problem to allow it

[01:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know about the absence or presence of problems

[01:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: so it seems intentional and longstanding to return the same NodeList, but there doesn't seem to mention of intentionally violating the DOM spec

[02:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, the w() function just outputs the value to the log below. It says "Same object: true" for me in Minefield, but false in Opera and WebKit

[02:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I see the same (after changing to document.write) and Firefox 3.5.2 also has the Minefield behavior

[02:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen also found that this Firefox behavior dates back to 2002

[02:13:02.0000] <Lachy>
wasn't the w() function working for you?

[02:13:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I might not have looked in the right place

[02:13:04.0000] <Lachy>
it's in the log at the very bottom of the page, below the rendered view of the page

[02:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
indeed I did not - since the log was scrolled off the bottom of my window

[02:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
othermaciej, why are we going to do a new CfC for publishing Microdata?

[02:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: the new CfC will be for HTML5, Microdata, 2D Context, and HTML+RDFa to all get first or new Working Drafts

[02:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: reasons for a new CfC are threefold:

[02:18:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(a) some of the objections from the first one will be addressed by Hixie's changes

[02:18:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(b) the HTML5 proposed for publication originally will be materially changed by the further splitting of 2D Context

[02:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(c) may as well just have one CfC for everything we want to publish

[02:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
you know, it strikes me that i have no way to describe a string as having to match the HTML or XML syntax

[02:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
this seems like a substantial oversight

[02:20:02.0000] <Lachy>
really? How do you state that requirement for innerHTML?

[02:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are no conformance criteria for what hte value passed to innerHTML should be

[02:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[02:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess for this body="" or whatever we end up calling it, i can add a new subsection to the syntax section that describes a document with the doctype made optional

[02:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
and then i can make the <title> section say that it can be omitted for these types of documents

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm leaning towards calling the attribute doc="" or srcdoc="" again, btw, since body="" doesn't really work if it's a full doc (especially in xml)

[02:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
you could call it content=""

[02:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's confusingly similar to <meta content>, especially with microdata

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
it would also screw over RDFa

[02:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
which I'd rather not do

[02:26:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[02:26:03.0000] <Lachy>
how would it screw over RDFa? Do they use a content attribute?

[02:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, iirc

[02:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't mind if you screw over RDFa. I'm ignoring their spec entirely

[02:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
inlinesrc="..."

[02:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does pagehide fire if the document being navigated away from hasn't fired its onload yet?

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. doesn't matter in the case I'm looking at

[02:38:00.0000] <Creap>
Is there a place with an easy list of all legal attributes in HTML5? for a syntax checker

[02:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
Creap, there's the index of attributes in the spec http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#attributes-0

[03:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML5 YouTube, awesome.  Now all it needs is fullscreen support.

[03:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe I'll still have to switch from Chrome to Firefox to view YouTube, for the fullscreen support instead of Flash.  :P

[03:13:00.0000] <Necrathex>
isn't it possible for youtube to support both h264 and theora, so everyone is happy?

[03:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, it also doesn't work on lots of videos.

[03:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Necrathex, if they transcode their ridiculously large existing body of content, yes, in theory.

[03:14:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, right, I can't use Firefox to view YouTube, no H.264 support.  Rats.

[03:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I guess I still will sometimes, just using Flash.

[03:14:03.0000] <Necrathex>
well, they did that before with the transition to HQ and HD vids

[03:16:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
AryehGregor: you could use opera on linux if your gstreamer can play h264

[03:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
zcorpan__, interesting thought.  Does it support full-screen?

[03:17:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
AryehGregor: no, not yet

[03:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, YouTube doesn't say it's supported.

[03:17:03.0000] <hsivonen>
a new public draft of XHTML2 is out: http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2010/ED-xhtml2-20100113/

[03:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, then I may as well keep using Chrome.  :)

[03:17:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait, I thought the XHTMLWG had been discontinued?

[03:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: the charter of the XHTML2 WG expired at the end of last year, but apparently the WG didn't turn into a pumpkin immediately

[03:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can publish new working drafts without a charter?

[03:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: I've heard you can.

[03:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Obviously so.

[03:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then what's the point of a charter, though . . . ?

[03:20:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Could they decide they'd publish a new version of PNG too?  That's not outside their charter right now.  :)

[03:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I guess we can now go back to telling people who don't like HTML5 to join the XHTMLWG. 

[03:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the XHTML2 WG

[03:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
zombie wg!

[03:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually to be fair they published that note (which they were required to publish) within only a few weeks of the charter running out

[03:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
in w3c terms that's positively timely

[03:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
contrast with us (the htmlwg), we're at this point something like a year or two behind schedule

[03:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
did they already publish it as a Note. I thought it was still an ED for a Note.

[03:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I guess this is basically because everything published as a FPWD must become a REC or a NOTE

[03:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: oh i thought that was the note

[03:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so pagehide is supposed to fire in all iframes of a pages that is being navigated away from, right?

[03:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
are there some exceptions to this?

[03:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
how come if i publish an ED that claims to be a WD or NOTE i get told off but they can do it and it's fine?

[03:25:03.0000] <Philip`>
It does say "W3C Note" on the left, and "This document is a Working Group Note. The XHTML2 Working Group's charter expired before it could finish work on this specification.", so I'd assume it's meant to be a Note

[03:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't seem to have made the TR/ page yet

[03:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
but the 13th was a long time ago

[03:26:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
maybe they just forgot to change the boilerplate

[03:26:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Maybe because HTML5 is important enough for people to care about, whereas fewer people worry about what happens with XHTML2

[03:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Or maybe because everybody hates you and wants to make trouble for you

[03:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
your first hypothesis was better

[03:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't like the other one

[03:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
it makes me sad

[03:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hopefully evidence supports the first one :-)

[03:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
shouldn't a scientist test both hypotheses?

[03:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
i gave up science after university

[03:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, sure.  Shall we go find one?

[03:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: go ahead :-)

[03:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Bah, Analytics still uses Flash all over the place.

[03:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me glares at it

[03:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so, pagehide is supposed to be targeted at the document but be dispatched on the window, right?

[03:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and then there's another piece of magic that handles the onpagehide attribute on the body element, right?

[03:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so the event handler magically goes on window and not on body, right?

[03:48:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
hsivonen: yes, onpagehide on HTMLBodyElement and HTMLFrameSetElement register a listener on window

[03:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok.

[03:48:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
hsivonen: and yes to the first question

[03:48:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and pagehide and unload are sync, and pageshow and load are always async, right?

[03:49:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i don't know about syncness

[03:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ok. thanks

[04:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, which videos on YouTube now support HTML5? Have they started rolling out support for that already?

[04:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, yes.

[04:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/01/introducing-youtube-html5-supported.html

[04:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not all videos, but a lot.

[04:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You'll have to check if they do browser sniffing or capability testing to exclude Opera.  :)

[04:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
awesome, 1080p is coming too! http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2009/11/1080p-hd-comes-to-youtube.html

[04:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
where can I find an actual video page using <video>?

[04:08:01.0000] <Lachy>
I clicked the link on http://www.youtube.com/html5 to join the HTML5 beta

[04:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: after you have joined, I think you can go to any video and get html5

[04:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
it doesn't seem to be supported on any video, but I found one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQThSvHiYjU&feature=popular

[04:26:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
has anyone tried it with opera (on linux)?

[04:27:00.0000] <Necrathex>
cant even get it to work in chromium

[04:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, the Save link on the Live DOM Viewer seems to be broken

[04:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
huh

[04:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have no idea why

[04:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems sqlite changed

[04:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't see how

[04:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, how it is differnet

[04:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
well i did something that shouldn't have made any difference

[04:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
and it seems to work now

[04:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[04:56:00.0000] <ader10>
Does the HTML5 doctype tag work in IE5?

[04:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
ader10: IE 5 doesn't have modes, so mode switching considerations are irrelevant. I haven't tested it for parsing oddities, though.

[04:59:01.0000] <ader10>
Thanks for your helpful answer.

[05:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
ader10: For IE5/Mac, which nobody uses, it uses standards mode AFAIK

[05:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
judging from the YouTube feedback forum, Google now has the kind of fanboyism Apple has had for years

[05:43:00.0000] <dytrivedi>
joined!

[06:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wow, rumor has it that Bing might become the default search on the iPhone?  Microsoft and Apple *teaming up*, against Google?  How times change.

[06:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
If it's true, I'd tend to assume it's more to do with Microsoft offering Apple more money to be the default search provider than Google is offering, rather than being about teaming up with/against anyone

[07:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'd assume that's the same reason Opera oscillates between Google and Yahoo and Ask as the default)

[07:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
when has Ask been the default on Opera?

[07:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Eh, there's a lot of strategizing here too.  Does Google really pay Mozilla tens of millions of dollars a year just to be the default search provider, or also to get at Microsoft?

[07:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: It's the default right now, on the Speed Dial page in 10.10

[07:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
(although "default" probably isn't the right term, because I don't think it's possible to change it to anything else)

[07:04:00.0000] <FireFly>
Philip`, it's trivial to change it

[07:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: oh

[07:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
does Ask actually work?

[07:04:03.0000] <FireFly>
Right click -> manage search engines

[07:04:04.0000] <Philip`>
FireFly: Ah, right, I just found that

[07:04:05.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No idea, I never use it :-)

[07:04:06.0000] <hsivonen>
does Ask do their own R&D or do they outsource to someone else?

[07:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
who is supplying actual search back end stuff other than Google and Microsoft?

[07:05:01.0000] <takkaria_>
I thought Ask used google's backend

[07:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Opera defaults to Google to me

[07:05:03.0000] <Philip`>
As far as I'm aware they have their own backend

[07:05:04.0000] <hsivonen>
is it Ask just for new installations?

[07:05:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Yandex? :)

[07:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, I didn't know we'd switched the speeddial search to Ask.

[07:06:01.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. http://sp.uk.ask.com/en/docs/about/webmasters.shtml talks about their crawler

[07:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. it's Ask in Speed Dial and Google in the toolbar

[07:06:03.0000] <hsivonen>
that's ... interesting

[07:07:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I think it's a bit silly to have multiple defaults. But AIUI, it's done for financial reasons of some kind, though that's not my department and I have no idea what deals we have with each search engine.

[07:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I wonder where Opera gets its revenue.  Google, Microsoft, and Apple all have huge non-browser sources of revenue, and Mozilla gets paid by Google.

[07:09:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
opera ships on lots of devices

[07:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, we get lots of revenue from device manufactures who pay us to put Opera on their devices. e.g. Nintendo Wii, HTC phones, Samsung phones, etc.

[07:10:01.0000] <FireFly>
There's the wii browser

[07:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ah, right.

[07:10:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I seem to recall seeing a press release that the desktop browser was also in black, though

[07:10:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The non-desktop market.

[07:10:05.0000] <Dashiva>
A few years back

[07:10:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Opera Link doesn't tell me about crypto

[07:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, what would you like to know about it?

[07:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
If we encrypt the connection between you and Opera Link, or whether the data is stored encrypted on our servers?

[07:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: I think the idea was Mozilla gets paid by Google for being the default search engine, and so Opera could do exactly the same (with revenue proportional to market share)

[07:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: those and whether Opera can decrypt it

[07:12:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and for search engines other than Google)

[07:12:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and if Opera can't decrypt it, how does Mini work?

[07:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(for comparison, the crypto key for Weave residers on the user's devices)

[07:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
*resides

[07:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Does Google already have a way for syncing Chrome and the Android browser?

[07:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this sync stuff is clearly going to make browser choices more sticky, because one has to buy into the product family of one vendor for all devices

[07:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(well, the Weave API is documented, but I'm not aware of any non-Gecko-based browsers implementing a sync client)

[07:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Cross-browser sync would be awesome.  Especially if it actually synced my logins and cookies, not just useless stuff like bookmarks.

[07:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It could sync my currently open pages.  Maybe even my history, for things like the awesome bar/omnibox, but that might be a bit much.

[07:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
already works if you run one product family across all your devices

[07:17:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I have Weave syncing 3 desktop Firefoxes and one Firefox Mobile

[07:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but then I have a device that has Opera Mobile but not Firefox

[07:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, that only works for Firefox, right?  Chrome only supports bookmark sync, I think . . .

[07:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but I can't use Opera Mobile as a Weave client

[07:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: right

[07:18:04.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I asked internally, and was given this as the answer. http://www.opera.com/privacy/#operalink

[07:18:05.0000] <Lachy>
they don't seem to want to reveal more than that

[07:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: thanks

[07:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
can Opera Link sync passwords?

[07:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=812

[07:19:03.0000] <hsivonen>
syncing passwords is an awesome feature of Weave

[07:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but I wouldn't sync my passwords using a system where the sync server operator could decrypt

[07:21:00.0000] <Creap>
let's all put our passwords "in the cloud" :)

[07:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Creap: putting passwords in the cloud is fine if your crypto key doesn't travel to the cloud

[07:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You'd have to copy a private key between all your computers, then.  How would that work?

[07:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't see how it could be as convenient as having a central party know your password.

[07:23:01.0000] <Philip`>
You could type it in

[07:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: with Weave, I created an insanely long key that I printed and typed in on the other devices once for each

[07:23:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Google already knows my Gmail password anyway, and I can use that to recover practically any of my other logins except for my bank, so . . .

[07:23:04.0000] <Philip`>
(assuming it's like some kind of master password, not a 4096-bit private key)

[07:23:05.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, we do use SSL connections for syncing between the client and the server, but it seems I can't get an answer about what security measures we take to protect the data on the server.

[07:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, yeah, a master password would work.

[07:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: thanks

[07:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: Weave has a password that you log into the server with

[07:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: and with that password, you can retrieve encrypted data from the server

[07:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and then you decrypt it with a long passphrase that never travels to the cloud

[07:26:00.0000] <hsivonen>
as far as I can tell, the scariest part of Weave is losing your mobile device

[07:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Can you choose to skip the extra passphrase if you don't care about hiding from the cloud?

[07:26:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: IIRC, no

[07:26:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, is someone working on integrating this with the system so that it automatically unlocks when you log in?

[07:26:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because having to type a password every time you start your browser is obnoxious.

[07:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: you don't need to

[07:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me used master passwords on Firefox and doesn't think the feature exists on Chrome, but doesn't miss it much . . .

[07:27:02.0000] <hsivonen>
each local browser remembers both the password and the passphase

[07:27:03.0000] <hsivonen>
which is why losing your mobile device becomes scarier

[07:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but it's so awesome you want to use it on your mobile device anyway

[07:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I guess if the attacker can't log in, you're safe.  Probably an attacker would prefer to just wipe the thing and sell it.  A determined one could access everything, but the same is true if you have your browser remember your passwords . . .

[07:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know how safe e.g. Maemo is against an attacker who possesses the device

[07:29:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
you'd need a way to lock your device from somewhere else if you lose it

[07:29:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the Maemo security folks work against threats from the network

[07:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or wipe it, like with MobileMe

[07:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
A determined attacker with physical access can probably break anything except an encrypted disk.

[07:30:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
preferably also a way to find your device again if you lose it

[07:30:03.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, have you tried 1Password? I believe their system does client side encryption before syncing with a server

[07:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
A determined attacker can grab your device while you're in the middle of using it and are alerady logged in

[07:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: not with multiple Macs

[07:31:02.0000] <Creap>
zcorpan__: when I lost my cellphone, someone found "home" and called to return it.

[07:31:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I installed it once on one Mac

[07:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I installed it recently to try it out. But I haven't fully learned about how it all works yet, and it seems to have some annoying UI bugs that I don't like

[07:32:01.0000] <Creap>
android has some PIN:y thing as a screenlock

[07:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: but I didn't trust the app would always be compatible with everything, so I didn't want to make it part of my routines

[07:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and instead I use Keychain and Firefox password manager

[07:32:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, not necessarily, unless they have a gun or something, or you leave yourself logged in all the time.

[07:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Maemo has a PIN screenlock, too.

[07:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
the Firefox password manager stores everything in a barely obfuscated password file.

[07:33:02.0000] <Lachy>
I use that too, but I'm trying to migrate away from it

[07:33:03.0000] <Lachy>
well, unless you use a master password, but I found that to be rather intrusive

[07:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
on Mac, I use Filevault in case immigration officials take my laptop and store it inappropriately

[07:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: You don't need a gun to grab a phone out of somebody's hand when they're not expecting it, or from a table when they're not watching it for a few seconds

[07:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Firefox master passwords are lousy UI.  You have a modal dialog popping up at some random point after you restart the browser every time.

[07:35:02.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: and then you run away before the owner catches you

[07:36:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, okay, granted.

[07:36:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Most of us don't face determined attackers, happily.

[07:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Seems a lot simpler than trying to extract passwords from the device's memory

[07:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not memory, disk, unless that's encrypted.

[07:38:01.0000] <workmad3>
physical device security is always a problem

[07:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's the easiest way, if you have any technical know-how.

[07:38:03.0000] <workmad3>
that is, until we have a keypad that can read and check your fingerprint on every key-press :)

[07:38:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Much less risky, you can steal it whenever and however you feel like.

[07:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
And don't have to worry that maybe they weren't actually logged in.

[07:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
workmad3, fingerprints are easy for a dedicated attacker to forge.

[07:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Your fingerprints are going to be all over the phone.

[07:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just make a mold, doesn't even take a day if you know what you're doing.

[07:39:04.0000] <workmad3>
ok... easy until the devices are implanted directly into our bodies

[07:39:05.0000] <workmad3>
better? :P

[07:39:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, that would solve the issue.

[07:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would also freak out some Christians, particularly if the devices were used for commerce.  :P

[07:40:01.0000] <workmad3>
heh :)

[07:40:02.0000] <workmad3>
/me wants a retina implant for his phone display already

[07:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Should it treat pt as a physical unit?  :)

[07:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hehe

[07:43:00.0000] <workmad3>
hmm, that's a point (no pun intended)... are there physical differences in the size of rods and cones, and if so, which should be used?

[07:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What?

[07:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems rods and cones are about the same size.

[07:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait, hmm.

[07:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or maybe cones are much larger, the Wikipedia articles are confusing.

[07:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(as usual)

[08:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"User agents may wait for a suitable break in the user's interaction before queuing the task; for example, a user agent could wait for the user to have not hit a key for 100ms, so as to only fire the event when the user pauses, instead of continuously for each keystroke."

[08:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I guess this means we need to use onkeypress or onkeyup instead of oninput?

[08:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If we really want to have it be per key.

[08:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess there's no event that fires after the input has happened, so that it will reliably fire once each keystroke and event.target.value will be the current value?

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why would you want such a thing?

[08:17:01.0000] <Philip`>
What do you expect it to do with input methods where you use multiple keystrokes to insert a single character?

[08:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just give the current value after whatever the user just entered.  Really I want an event whenever the contents of the form field change, with the new value of the field.

[08:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
For using <datalist>.

[08:18:02.0000] <Philip`>
Why is 100ms latency unacceptable?

[08:18:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I want to dispatch the new contents to my backend to ask for suggestions.

[08:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Because the result has to be thrown out if the form value is no longer the same when the suggestion returns, and there already may be a significant round-trip delay.

[08:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
You'd have to implement some kind of buffering yourself anyway, because you don't want to send a request to the backend after every keystroke if the user's typing really really fast and has a dialup connection

[08:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me tries to figure out if MW already buffers

[08:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It looks like we usually wait 250 ms, except if the user hits the down arrow.

[08:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
We use keyup, keydown, keypress, blur, and focus, but of course we also use a <div> positioning hack right now to generate the results.

[08:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably we don't need to hook blur and focus with datalist.

[08:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Using datalists via JS is really ugly, by the way.

[08:23:03.0000] <Philip`>
Given that pages will have to implement some kind of buffering if some browsers don't buffer themselves, it seems silly for the spec to say "may" - it should require buffering for all browsers or none

[08:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd really prefer just input.suggest = ['Foo', 'Bar'] instead of creating a datalist element, making up an id, giving it the id, setting the input's list attribute, and looping through the result list to add <option> children.

[08:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
(maybe)

[08:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, yeah, "may" is a pain.

[08:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Author feedback from attempting to use the element is a good thing to have :-)

[08:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, datalist is useful to have when the choices are a fixed list, so they can just be listed in the page and not have to worry about being modified by scripts

[08:26:01.0000] <Lachy>
but maybe we need an optimised API for the scripted use cases that dynamically change the list

[08:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, when does that actually happen?  I can't think of a real-world page where it would be useful.

[08:26:03.0000] <Lachy>
html5.lachy.id.au has uses a fixed list

[08:26:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The only use-case I can see for this is suggestions generated as the user types.

[08:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting.

[08:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
also, another simple case is a form requesting personal details.  The title field could offer defaults of Mr, Mrs, Ms, etc. but still allow users to type in their own

[08:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, granted, it has some uses, but the script use case seems a lot more compelling.

[08:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Normal UI widget systems have combo boxes, which seem to be what this is similar to

[08:27:04.0000] <Philip`>
and they're used in lots of places

[08:27:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I've seen plenty of sites hack up their own absolutely-positioned divs to do dynamic search suggestions, never seen anyone try it to suggest MIME types or honorifics.

[08:27:06.0000] <Philip`>
like, um,

[08:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I still don't know what a combobox is.

[08:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me fails to think of compelling examples of static lists

[08:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: It's just a dropdown list you can type arbitrary text into

[08:29:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm, okay.

[08:29:01.0000] <webben>
Rationale: maximize conformity of input without enforcing uniformity.

[08:29:02.0000] <webben>
e.g. by offering a carot against entry of multiple spellings of a thing

[08:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, the only one I can easily find in my currently-open applications is a "Default Graphic Extension" configuration, which offers eps/pdf/png/jpg/tif but lets you type in other values if you want

[08:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, a combobox is just a select list, but which also allows users to type in other values.  Your browsers address bar is bascially an example of this.

[08:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting.

[08:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
ordinarily, they have drop down arrows on the side, but unfortunatley, Opera's datalist implementation omitted this for some reason

[08:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
Scripted search suggestions typically don't have arrows on the side

[08:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe there should be an entirely separate JS-only interface for scripted search suggestions?

[08:34:02.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, HTMLSelectElement contains APIs for add() and remove(), that simply the process of adding and removing options. Would those help if they were available on datalist, or would you like a more optimised alternative?

[08:34:03.0000] <Philip`>
Seems problematic if the same HTML control is meant to be used for all the cases

[08:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I suppose. Perhaps that issue is best handled with CSS using the 'appearance' property.

[08:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
appearance: combo-box; is already defined in the spec

[08:37:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, I'd really just like to be able to do input.suggest = ['foo', 'bar'].  I don't see why it should need to be more complicated than that.

[08:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
how would that interact with the suggestions from the datalist element, if both were used together?

[08:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd expect the scripted results would override the datalist ones.

[08:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But I dunno, just don't use them together.  :)

[08:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Doesn't matter much for authors, it just needs to be unambiguous.

[08:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
maybe it could merge the two sets of suggestions, like Firefox's search box does, when it lists previous searches, then a separator line, and then the google suggest results.

[08:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I dunno.  It's hard to say without use-cases.

[08:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, maybe the browser could merge datalist suggestions with its own too, right?

[08:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I think the spec says it can do that

[08:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, I guess the spec permits that, doesn't it?

[08:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
Are people really going to use datalist if its behaviour is so unpredictable?

[08:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd hope it works consistently everywhere, otherwise people would be better off writing their own implementations in JS

[08:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
for existing scripted implementations, do you know what the responses from the server looks like? Do they commonly just return JSON, or even just an serialised array, and then use eval(...) to parse it?

[08:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, that's what mwsuggest.js does.

[08:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
JSON in our case.

[08:42:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
So allowing a literal list to be assigned would be ideal.

[08:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Do you know what Google Suggest uses?

[08:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
No idea.

[08:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.google.com/complete/search?q=what

[08:48:00.0000] <Lachy>
I found an article explaining it http://serversideguy.blogspot.com/2004/12/google-suggest-dissected.html

[08:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's changed a little bit since 2004

[08:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting that they just use a loop instead of key events.

[08:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Er, right, used.

[08:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, does your use case involve replacing the entire suggestion list each time the data is updated, or would you want the ability to selectively add and remove options?

[08:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, replacing the whole thing is fine, typically.

[08:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If it's just a list, I don't see why you couldn't use normal list methods, though.

[08:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Are there any existing list-taking APIs in HTML?

[08:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Seems tricky to make the reflection work right

[08:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why would it be tricky?

[08:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. if people say x=[]; input.suggest=x; x.push('cheese'); // does suggest update?

[08:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
or x=input.suggest; x.push('cheese'); // does suggest update?

[08:58:03.0000] <Philip`>
or input.suggest.push('cheese'); // surely this should update?

[08:58:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Don't the same questions apply to strings?

[08:58:05.0000] <Philip`>
No

[08:58:06.0000] <Philip`>
Strings are immutable

[08:58:07.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think that would work.

[08:58:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[08:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Immutability makes everything easy

[08:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So every single API in HTML only takes immutable objects?

[08:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, everything except mutations)

[08:59:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Just say it copies the list on assignment, if you want.

[09:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'd expect input.suggest to use a specialised interface, not a normal array

[09:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: They take immutable strings/numbers, or objects with special interfaces that define their own mutation semantics

[09:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, as long as you can assign an array to it and have it work, be auto-converted or such.  Does that sound reasonable?

[09:00:03.0000] <Lachy>
but I would expect the setter for input.suggest to accept an array, and to return a collection on getting.

[09:00:04.0000] <Lachy>
not sure what type of collection to return though

[09:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: If it copies the list on assignment, would you still expect normal list methods to work? (input.suggest.push etc)

[09:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, I suggest you clearly document the use case and problem to be solved, and document the proposed solution along with it.

[09:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
k.

[09:01:03.0000] <Lachy>
write it up in the wiki

[09:01:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was planning on posting to whatwg.

[09:01:05.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that'll do too

[09:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Arguing about intent with regard to XHTML served as text/html, when XML itself completely ignores intent...

[10:27:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Heyo

[12:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait, so the list IDL property of inputs isn't settable?

[12:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
readonly attribute HTMLElement list;

[12:32:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That might explain my problems.

[12:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I assumed it reflected the list DOM attribute.

[12:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/common-input-element-attributes.html#dom-input-list says what it does

[12:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
and indeed it doesn't say it reflects anything

[12:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I eventually figured that out.  :)

[14:59:00.0000] <remysharp>
quick question: with a web socket, is there any way to 'reopen' a socket if the socket go closed? Or do I just create a brand new WebSocket?

[15:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.  Opera seems not to update the suggestions list from <datalist> until you press a key.  This makes it fairly useless for dynamic scripting.

[15:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
data:text/html,<!doctype html><input list="datalist" onkeypress="document.getElementById('datalist').innerHTML = '<option value=&quot;' + event.target.value + 'fizzle&quot;>'; return true"><datalist id="datalist"></datalist>

[15:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Notice how it lags behind what you type by one key.

[15:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Any workaround?  Should I file this in Opera's bug tracker where I never see any response and don't get any status notifications ever?

[15:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
what does the spec say about the issue?

[15:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It doesn't, it's very vague, as with all UI issues.  But it seems wrong if I update the datalist and the suggestions don't actually display right away.

[15:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd expect them to display immediately (if suggestions would normally be displayed right now).

[15:15:02.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, I would recommend filing a bug anyway, since it's obviosly not well optimised for the use cases it's meant for

[15:15:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I was going to convert mwsuggest.js to use <datalist> where supported, but I guess I won't if the suggestions are for what you typed in on the last key . . .

[15:15:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
You mean a spec bug?

[15:15:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or an Opera bug?

[15:15:06.0000] <Lachy>
Opera bug

[15:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
but you could file a spec bug too, if you think the spec needs to say something about this

[15:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay.

[15:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
though, it is a UI issue, so maybe it doesn't

[15:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Last time I filed an Opera bug (also about a problem with Opera HTML5 implementation) I never got a response.

[15:16:04.0000] <Philip`>
All you need to do is get yourself employed by Opera, so you can access the bug tracker

[15:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't think the spec needs to say anything here, although I'll have other suggestions about <datalist>.

[15:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, why didn't I ever think of that

[15:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
?

[15:17:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Spec violation – Opera is performing contrary to published, interworking recommendations by the W3C"  So I shouldn't use this if it violates IETF specs?  :)

[15:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, unfortunately, since we don't run an open bug tracker, external bug reporters don't automatically get notified of further discussions

[15:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me enters a data: URL in the "What URL triggers this bug, if any?" field

[15:18:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, why don't you run an open bug tracker?  It's very annoying.

[15:18:03.0000] <Lachy>
I know. The issue has been discussed internally many times

[15:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I figured, but I was wondering what the reasons are for the status quo.  Since you aren't saying, and neither did the last Opera dev I talked to about this (who was possibly also you), I guess it's secret.

[15:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well.

[15:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess I'll work for Wikimedia instead.  :P

[15:19:03.0000] <Lachy>
unfortunately, AIUI, we have bugs related to client work and other secret stuff that can't be revealed publicly, and there's no easy way to identify bugs that are safe for public viewing from those that aren't

[15:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, Apple manages.  I assume they have secret internal bug trackers, but they have a public Bugzilla too.

[15:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
For WebKit, I mean.

[15:20:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm sure you've heard all this before, though.

[15:20:03.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I know. But we only have one bug tracker used for both internal and external reports

[15:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's been suggested that bugs filed by external reporters are made public, but then the issue here is that someone internally could comment and inadvertenly mention something that's not public knowledge

[15:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, filed as DSK-276870.

[15:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, crud, it looks like I accidentally quoted Manu on-list when he replied to me off-list.

[15:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I hate it when I do that.

[15:31:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me blames Gmail.

[15:32:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me feels really guilty.

[15:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, if you replied to an off-list mail, why would gmail add pubilc-html to the CC list?

[15:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, because I reply to all on the first post I'm replying to, then copy-paste other things to reply to from lower posts.  This is the only way I can see to respond to multiple people in the same post.

[15:40:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I prefer not to make five posts in a row responding to five separate people.

[15:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me wonders which meaning of the phrase 'table the discussion' Maciej was using when he wrote "let's table this process discussion for now"

[15:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Presumably "set aside", since we were in the middle of discussing it already, so the other definition wouldn't make sense, would it?

[15:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that was my assumption

[15:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Words shouldn't be able to mean two opposite things.  >:(

[15:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"ravel" is another culprit, but it's less common.

[15:43:03.0000] <Lachy>
but I really hate that phrase since it has 2 contradictory meanings, and I never remember which one is the typical American meaning, and which is the typical British (or, rest of the world) meaning

[15:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's usually clear from context, though.

[15:56:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Grah, it's surprising how much of a difference a little syntax makes.  I don't like passing literal arrays to functions in PHP, especially nested ones.  But passing objects in javascript is no problem at all.

[15:56:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, it's remarkable.

[15:57:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The syntax for arrays in PHP is ugly, and it makes them so much less usable.

[15:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: I meant it in the colloquial sense of "set aside", not the formal parliamentary sense of "let's put it before the group as the topic of discussion"

[15:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: It's especially annoying because the ugliness of the syntax is the only thing really stopping me from finally making my sql-query constructor handle table joins.

[15:59:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh, so you made one too?


2010-01-22
[16:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
MediaWiki has a pretty nice one.

[16:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Of course, how can you *possibly* spend any significant amount of time hand-constructing queries?

[16:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's horrible.

[16:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've been thinking of switching to a chaining-based api just so I can implement joins without gobs of horrible nesting.

[16:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
in microdata, can someone clarify for me how I'm supposed to use the "fn" and "n" properties in the vcard vocabulary?

[16:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't get why both "fn" and "n" exist, or why "fn" must be present if "n" is present

[16:08:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think it's legacy constraints from the original vcard format.

[16:08:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
The microformats wiki page should explain their use pretty well.

[16:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It was sensical enough for me to use it on my pages, at least.

[16:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
But if I use <span itemprop="fn n">, then "n" actually needs to be an item, so that would become <span itemscope itemprop="fn n">, but "fn" is supposed to be a string, not an item, so then I would have to split them into two separate elements.

[16:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
or otherwise rely on the implied "n" optimisation

[16:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.  Yeah, I think you can't use them together in Microdata, and have to either put both of them in or use the implied "n" optimizations.

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm baffled by the number of people who don't want the spec to encourage user agents to try to make things better for AT users in the face of authoring mistakes

[16:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
why do people want to pubish users for authoring mistakes?

[16:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's like the whole draconican parsing thing all over again

[16:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I think people are either misreading the spec, or buying into a subtle argument about giving authors incorrect expectations

[16:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hixie, I think they're mostly asking to rephrase to be vaguer at this point, aren't they?

[16:16:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think people are opposed to ATs providing a better user experience. They seem to be opposed to the spec setting seemingly unrealistic requirements and somehow giving authors unrealistic expectaions and choosing not to give alternative text

[16:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
+1 to Lachy.

[16:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
and since the purpose of the statement in the spec is to give implementations permission to use alternative techniques, it seems reasonable to say so without indicating what those techniques may be, especially when it could be misconstrued as referring to futuristic technologies

[16:18:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is, I certainly don't want to punish users because authors were bad.  It totally makes sense that image-reading heuristics, when they exist and are practical, should be used in the absence of @alt.

[16:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
OCR is not a futuristic technology

[16:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it would probably fine to say that if alt is missing, UAs can present any other information they are able to get in lieu of a text alternative

[16:19:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think it's clear to everyone that "image analysis heuristics" refers to things like OCR.

[16:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
and if specific examples are listed at all, they should be clearly realistic examples like using the filename or performing OCR

[16:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
people seem to be thinking it refers to some kind of futuristic AI, that can look at a picture and determine what it is and what it means in context

[16:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
there is shipping technology today that does painting recognition, OCR, landmark recognition, etc, on arbitrary images

[16:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
which would really help users who can't see images

[16:20:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
"User agents may also apply image analysis heuristics…" does seem to imply that such heuristics exist, when outside of OCR they don't reliably.

[16:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes, but those things, like Google Goggles, require large collections of sample images with which to compare the subject image with

[16:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
there are in fact heuristics that can recognize all kinds of images other than images of text

[16:21:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Outside of images of text, though, you run into the intent problem.  A description of the image may not be valid alt text.

[16:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[16:21:04.0000] <othermaciej>
mostly either research projects, or somewhat experimental, and often requiring a huge corpus

[16:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
but it's better than nothing!

[16:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not even that clear to me how I'd use the shipping Google Goggles to build an accessibility feature for a UA - uploading every image that lacks alt text seems like a bad idea for both bandwidth and privacy reasons

[16:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, I just think you should try to find a way that makes the intent of the statement clear, without making people think the spec is setting unrealistic expectations

[16:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that being said, it seems like a much more general statement would both be less objectionable, and more broadly applicable

[16:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
well i'd be happy to make the text even vaguer so long as we still explicitly allow such behaviour

[16:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
(no bug was ever filed for this as far as i know, btw)

[16:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
personally, I thought image analysis heuristics was a rather general statement already, and I don't agree with most of the rationale that was given in the change proposal

[16:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i'm not exactly sure how to make it vaguer

[16:25:02.0000] <Lachy>
maybe use less jargon

[16:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
Change it to "User agents may also utilise any other available techniques or technologies to help the user make sense of the image when the user is unable to make direct use of the image, ..."

[16:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
well it's not _any_ other

[16:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. iirc we explicitly discourage use of the filename

[16:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
since that has been shown to hurt more than help

[16:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
that's an implementation decision though. There's no reason to have the spec explicitly disallow it

[16:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it might also help to say "get information about the image" instead of "make sense of the image"

[16:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
since the latter seems to be what makes people think the technology described is science-fictional

[16:31:02.0000] <Lachy>
also, the file name is not always useless. It is when it's a bunch of random letters or numbers, but if the AT recognises the file name as being readable words (e.g. by checking a dictionary), then why not use the file name as a last resort?

[16:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, many filenames are bad, but not all - the best thing would be for AT to use heuristics to determine if the file name is human-understandable

[16:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i could live with that

[16:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
Here the suggested text again with some changes: "User agents may also utilise any other available techniques or technologies to help the user obtain information about the image when the user is unable to make direct use of the image, ..."

[16:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
sounds wishy washy

[16:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
yep

[16:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
we should just come out and say what we mean

[16:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
if you can find text that people find satisfactory then I'd be happy to try to put this one through as an amicable resolution

[16:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
the amount of time i spend each day just dealing with new e-mail is getting ridiculous

[16:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: Sam and I are both trying hard to curtail threads that don't seem to be going anywhere, and to kick process debates off the list

[16:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(as of now, anyway)

[16:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
I was quite pleased when I saw both you and sam put a stop to process threads today :-)

[16:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: sadly public-html ain't hte half of it these days

[16:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: well, that's the only part I can really help with :-)

[16:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, whatwg has been difficult to keep up with too sometimes

[16:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'm still behind on that by about 1500 messages

[16:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
my problem is it's lots of little amounts of e-mail on lots of lists

[16:50:00.0000] <Lachy>
you have to learn to ignore more lists.

[16:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
Like how I ignore pretty much most internal mailing lists within opera, and only skim those that I do read

[16:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
I figure if it's important information, I'll hear about it some other way

[16:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have a pretty small set of lists I read constantly, a somewhat larger set of daily reading, a few I read about weekly, and then a lot that I only read occasionally when I have spare time 

[16:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: none of this is internal google mail, which is a whole other mailbox with even more mail...

[16:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: re the thread with the guy who wants to do concatenation with microdata

[16:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
TabAtkins: it's a bad idea for us to make <div itemscope itemtype="http://example.com/"><span itemprop="a/b"/></div> mean the same as <div itemscope itemtype="http://example.com/a/"><span itemprop="b"/></div>

[16:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
which is why microdata goes to such lengths to make sure that can't happen

[16:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
he should just use owl:equivalentProperty if he's using RDF, the same way the work vocabulary does

[17:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
does such concatenation work in RDFa? e.g. is <span xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" property="dc:title"> the same as <span xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/" property="dc:terms/title">?

[17:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That's just CURIEs, not anything specific to RDFa

[17:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
RDFa just gets full URIs from its CURIE processor, it doesn't care how they're split up

[17:11:01.0000] <Philip`>
(in theory)

[17:11:02.0000] <Lachy>
so, then both of those would be semantically identical for RDF?

[17:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[17:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's one of the biggest problems with RDFa, imho

[17:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
5:30pm and I'm done with mail.

[17:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
sheesh.

[18:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think i might settle on srcdoc=""

[18:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
names are hard.

[19:42:00.0000] <paul_irish>
what's the name of this feature? http://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase/

[19:42:01.0000] <paul_irish>
like if you were saying X browser had _____ support.

[19:42:02.0000] <paul_irish>
"web database" ... "opendatabase" .. "sqlstorage" ?

[19:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
Web SQL Database

[19:45:00.0000] <paul_irish>
had a feeling you'd give me the h1 of the page.... :) thx hix

[19:45:01.0000] <paul_irish>
ie

[20:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i assume you want <iframe srcdoc=""> to be async?

[20:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have some notes from the chrome team that say they want it to be sync

[20:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder if they still believe that

[20:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me suspects the Chrome team sometimes overstates the case on what things need to be async

[20:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I won't have much basis to question until we have process separation working directly in the WebKit tree

[20:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
<iframe src="a" srcdoc="b">

[20:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
support the srcdoc attribute is removed

[20:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
should the UA navigate to "a"?

[21:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll go with "no"

[21:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder what URL to use for these docs

[21:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
about:blank maybe

[21:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
or about:srcdoc

[21:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok srcdoc="" first draft is in

[21:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
let the flames begin

[21:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
or continue, i guess, since apparently the complaints start as soon as i mention an idea

[21:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually to be fair it's only a very few people who complain

[21:49:00.0000] <cardona507>
url?

[21:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://whatwg.org/html5 ? :-)

[21:49:02.0000] <cardona507>
I just searched current work

[21:51:00.0000] <cardona507>
hmmm - I still don't see it

[21:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
odd

[21:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
should be in the iframe section

[21:58:00.0000] <cardona507>
ok - I see srcdoc now 

[22:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me tries to work out exactly what it means for history.back() to be async

[22:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder where in the algorithm darin wants it to go async

[22:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
sweet kittens, this box has IE8 beta on it

[23:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I don't have enough data right now to say if I want doc='' to be sync or async

[23:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
currently, the HTML5 parser in Gecko has no way of parsing a full document from an UTF-16 string

[23:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it can only parse a full doc (in an async way) from a byte stream or a fragment (in a sync way) from an UTF-16 string

[23:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Does sync load include waiting for external stylesheets/scripts blocking?

[23:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: well, if doc='' can load stylesheets, scripts or XBL, making it sync would be bad

[23:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I haven't yet examined the dependencies of doc='', hence not enough data

[00:25:00.0000] <erlehmann>
hsivonen, i think there may be something wrong with the content model in validator.nu. the figure part looks weird to me http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.dieweltistgarnichtso.net%2Fhtml5-cc-plugin-fur-wordpress-version-0-6

[00:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: the figure stuff is waiting for the HTML WG Decision Process to run its course

[00:31:00.0000] <erlehmann>
hsivonen, no its more like: the description in the validator doesn't match the checked content model.

[00:31:01.0000] <erlehmann>
at least that is what i assume

[00:31:02.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: the description comes from the spec

[00:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: what's actually checked comes from the schema

[00:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
erlehmann: and they are out of sync while waiting for the Decision Process

[00:32:02.0000] <erlehmann>
i see. excuse me for bothering you.

[00:33:00.0000] <erlehmann>
and thanks for the explanation.

[00:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the situation sucks and causes bad UI

[00:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
we are at the moment having the first face-to-face meeting of the HTML5 Japanese Interest Group

[00:35:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
almost 100 people here

[00:35:02.0000] <erlehmann>
MikeSmith, live stream it using <video> ;)

[00:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: nice

[00:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
we have presenters here from Opera, Mozilla, Microsoft IE team, Google Chrome

[00:40:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
All major layout rendering engines.

[00:40:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
How are the trident folks?

[00:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
he's speaking about 1 hour or so from now

[00:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but likely will mostly be speaking about IE8

[00:41:02.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: who from Opera?

[00:41:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: Daniel Davis

[00:41:04.0000] <JonathanNeal>
What's this I hear about IE6 support getting extended to 2014, man.

[00:42:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Luckily I heard Cisco is finally gonna upgrade.

[00:42:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv: Tatsuki is here in the audience as well

[00:42:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
IE8 is all right, just has some display issues which I hope get patched, but ah hell probably won't.

[00:43:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
It sucks when you need to hit a browser like you do a broken stereo, .style.opacity = 0; .style.opacity = 1; just to get the thing to show a change.

[00:43:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I wish they could get a release cycle going like Chrome, Firefox, and Opera have been able to.

[00:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
They're getting closer

[00:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The 7-8 cycle was much shorter than 6-7 :)

[00:44:02.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Good.

[00:44:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Yes, it was.

[00:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess the problem is the principle of supporting the browser they shipped bundled with a given Windows release for the support life time of that Windows release

[00:45:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
But 6 to 7 was like the longest one of them all

[00:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Couldn't they just do some version number magic?

[00:46:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
97, 99, 2000, 01, 06.

[00:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I imagine supporting Iceweasel for the lifetime of a Debian system release is challege

[00:46:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Say that 9 is actually 8.1

[00:46:04.0000] <Dashiva>
And make 8.1 a mandatory upgrade from 8.0

[00:46:05.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Dashiva, I wish they would do stuff like that.

[00:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: as I understand it, it's not about numbers but about not changing behavior unless a security or legal (see Eolas) problem can't be fixed without a behavior change

[00:47:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Then they could add some performance perks and bring some actual competition to the other browsers --- plus I wouldn't mind ie supporting some css3

[00:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hum

[00:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
JonathanNeal: and if a perk breaks the Boeing intranet?

[00:48:02.0000] <Dashiva>
In that case they'd need to cut down the OS release cycle to something like what Apple does I guess

[00:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
to their credit, Microsoft (and Linux distros) communicate about OS release life cycles more clearly than Apple

[00:49:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hsivonen, no point if they'll lose the contract in 10 years to Firefox or Chrome, because they weren't making these advances.

[00:49:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't recall Apple ever communicating anything about OS life cycle 

[00:49:03.0000] <JonathanNeal>
And 10 years is a grossly larger number than I imagine it could be.

[00:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Safari 4 security patches shipped for OS X 10.4

[00:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: they did once communicate their OS release cycle at a WWDC talk ahead of Snow Leopard

[00:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
thought that may have been accidentally

[00:50:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: oh. so when are they stopping security patch support for 10.4?

[00:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
as it was more in passing, in a talk about something else

[00:50:05.0000] <hsivonen>
what about 10.5?

[00:50:06.0000] <Hixie>
and had minimal details

[00:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
but it was something!

[00:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
So I'm making this little online game, and I need a TCP port to use. But if I use one of the ports I'm supposed to use, some ISPs flag it as a torrent and start packet shaping

[00:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and 10.3 presumably no longer gets updates, but has Apple ever said so?

[00:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so if I want to make security decisions about my dad's Luxo iMac running 10.4, which Apple talks do I need to listen through for tea leaves?

[00:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: What do you mean by "supposed to"?

[00:53:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I think IE8 is moving in the right direction for the browser.

[00:53:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I always thought apple's life cycle was "until the next version is out, then you're on your own"

[00:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: you are preaching to the choir

[00:53:04.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: One of the 49152+ ones or what it is

[00:54:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Just hopefully not too little too late, I don't mind having multiple browsers, especially if they get easier to write cross compatibly for.

[00:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: about improving accessibility: if Google contributed open source OCR to Orca and NVDA today, and Apple cloned it for Voice Over tomorrow, people would freak out over authors not writing alt text for JAWS users

[00:54:02.0000] <Dashiva>
And if JAWS added it, they would freak out over not writing alt text for JAWS 4 users

[00:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Nobody cares about registration or anything, just pick an arbitrary number that nobody significant is using and it'll be fine :-)

[00:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: they've already freaked out, see public-html

[00:56:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: That's what I'll end up doing, yeah. So much for IANA.

[01:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Makoto Kato from Mozilla Japan is presenting now

[01:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
his title is Technical Advisor

[01:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
he said he doesn't know what that title is supposed to mean

[01:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Kato-san has a powerful voice.. had to turn down the volume a bit

[01:08:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
talking about File API, CSS Gradients, WOFF, WebGL

[01:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me peers strangely at the browsers he is testing

[01:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
some of them don't seem to be letting history.back() affect the history of iframes...

[01:10:02.0000] <Hixie>
browsers are weird

[01:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
man i wish someone had specced this crap in the 90s

[01:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: How about saying something more interesting, that we don't already know? :P

[01:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's becoming more and more clear that we just need to scrap it all and start from scratch

[01:12:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
a clean slate

[01:12:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Web 2.0!

[01:12:04.0000] <gsnedders>
Oh, wait.

[01:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
we also need to scrap HTTP, and TCP

[01:13:01.0000] <workmad3>
we'll get web 3.0 out the door and then move to a versionless web upgrade model? ;)

[01:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the Web should have been based on Display PostScript

[01:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe TeX

[01:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
is TCP that bad?

[01:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
SCTP is better

[01:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
I thought TCP was actually pretty reasonable, as a protocol

[01:15:03.0000] <workmad3>
MikeSmith: if it had been, I doubt it would have taken off in the same way

[01:15:04.0000] <Hixie>
a bit dated at this point, but the spec i thought was ok

[01:15:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
TCP is seriously pretty good but has significant limitations in high packet-loss networks

[01:15:06.0000] <workmad3>
MikeSmith: and clean slate is great from an academic and developer perspective, but the biggest driver (business) would resist it like the plague, for fairly good reasons

[01:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
like mobile-phone networks

[01:16:01.0000] <workmad3>
unless you keep it backwards compatible that is... and then you keep the mess around longer :)

[01:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
not that I know anything about TCP

[01:18:00.0000] <workmad3>
MikeSmith: you're pretty much spot on there :)

[01:19:00.0000] <workmad3>
TCP fails when a network that needs speed more than reliability, and performs atrociously over a low reliability network

[01:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hey, I got something right

[01:19:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think it's the first time this week

[01:19:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me pats himself on the back

[01:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me saw some people saying how TCP fails sometimes in data center networks because it has hundreds-of-milliseconds timeouts on packet loss even if the latency is far less than that

[01:20:01.0000] <workmad3>
but then, that's why networks that need speed implement their own reliability mechanisms (using a different model than TCP) on top of raw UDP packets :)

[01:21:00.0000] <workmad3>
e.g. game servers

[01:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
Games sometimes use UDP simply to get around NATs

[01:22:00.0000] <workmad3>
that said, TCP works, it works pretty well for what it does and is, and I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon

[01:22:01.0000] <workmad3>
/me waits to be proven wrong

[01:24:00.0000] <erlehmann>
MikeSmith, in mobile phone networks with high packet loss, i often get packet duplicates, weird. is it that what you mean ?

[01:24:01.0000] <workmad3>
erlehmann: that's one of the problems

[01:24:02.0000] <workmad3>
that'll happen when your ACK packet gets lost or takes too long to get to the server :)

[01:24:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I think most mobile phone networks basically don't use TCP over the air

[01:25:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
they use WTCP or something

[01:25:01.0000] <erlehmann>
yeah, they use another transport layer and fake packet loss or something ?

[01:25:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
something like that

[01:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: i think there's a huge difference between specs needing improvement, and specs needing to be written from scratch because the specs themselves are inadequate (as in the case of HTML, DOM, etc).

[01:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: true, and there's big difference between a technology that was fundamentally sound of the use cases it was intended for and specced out for at time, and one for which the spec was inadequate/ambiguous to the point where implementers ended up implementing it in non-interoperable ways

[01:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
does this crash safari trunk? http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/level0/history/sync-vs-async/007.html

[01:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
(it crashes safari 4 on windows)

[01:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: yeah

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: does this crash safari trunk? http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/dom/level0/history/sync-vs-async/007.html (it crashes safari 4 windows)

[01:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
(i can't get webkit to run on this windows machine)

[01:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: did not crash in a recent Mac debug build

[01:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I do not have Windows readily available

[01:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[01:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
let me check if it crashes Safari 4.0.4 on Mac

[01:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
answer: yes

[01:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so this is probably a fixed bug, not a platform-specific bug

[01:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i didn't think it was platform specific

[01:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[01:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
we have fixed a lot of crashers lately

[01:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
including super weird ones from fuzz testing

[01:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yay for fixed bugs

[02:01:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Masao Goto from IE team speaking here now

[02:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hash tag on twitter is #jaig5

[02:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
his current slide quotes Santayana: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

[02:07:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Mozilla's Kato-san's slides from today:

[02:07:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.slideshare.net/djraven/web-technology-features-with-firefox-36-gecko-192-and-later

[02:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: Calling location.replace("#foo") after the load event has fired, should it add a page to the history?

[02:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(That is Op's current behaviour)

[02:20:02.0000] <gsnedders>
i.e., treats it the same as location.hash

[02:20:03.0000] <virtuelv>
and chrome's behavior is to do the same as Opera

[02:20:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I though location.replace() was not supposed to ever add to the history

[02:20:05.0000] <virtuelv>
_except_ the first time location.replace is called

[02:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: no idea, but that's a good thing to add to the thread i just sent an e-mail on

[02:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: so i can make sure to spec it

[02:21:02.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: then spec what Firefox and IE does

[02:22:00.0000] <virtuelv>
which is to never ever add to the history

[02:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
virtuelv: send mail

[02:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok time to sleep

[02:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[02:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, othermaciej, I had another go at rewriting the image analsis heuristics text

[02:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
---

[02:37:02.0000] <Lachy>
When the user is unable to make direct use of the image, e.g. due to a visual disability or because they are using a text terminal with no graphics capabilities, user agents may also provide the user with the ability to obtain any other information about the image that may assist the user in understanding the content or purpose of the image, utilising any available repair technique.

[02:37:03.0000] <Lachy>
Such techniques may be based on information from any relevant source including, but not limited to, the following suggestions:

[02:37:04.0000] <Lachy>
* Obtaining the file name from the URL reference or HTTP headers supplied with the resource, such as the Content-Location or Content-Disposition header fields.

[02:37:05.0000] <Lachy>
* Extracting human readable metadata embedded within the resource. e.g. EXIF or RDF embedded within the resource.

[02:37:06.0000] <Lachy>
* Referring to alternative text associated with another instance of the same resource on the page,

[02:37:07.0000] <Lachy>
* Applying OCR techniques to recognise and extract textual content that is graphically represented on the image.

[02:37:08.0000] <Lachy>
For more information, refer to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines techniques for repairing missing content ([UAAG10-TECHS], section 2.7).

[02:37:09.0000] <Lachy>
---

[02:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: post it to the list I guess and see if people like it

[02:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok. What do you think of it?

[02:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: should XMP metadata be mentioned?

[02:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Larry cited it

[02:40:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure if it actually consists of RDF or not

[02:40:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy: looks good to me in general though

[02:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know either. But UAAG mentioned RDF embedded in the resource, so I figured that and EXIF would be enough for examples

[02:48:00.0000] <jgraham>
The file name is bad unless human readable.

[02:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
>So it should either say "the human readable part of the file name" or (perhaps better) we shouldn't bother enumerating all these techniques

[03:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, I am not sure enumerating some techniques is an improvement over not listing any

[03:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't really care either way.

[03:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
to me, talking about human-readable data in RDF in images is wishful

[03:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
as is talking about human-readable data in EXIF

[03:16:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: Some EXIF has human readable data

[03:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
But it is typically not a replacement for an image in context

[03:17:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
alt -- as found on the web -- is typically not a replacement for an image in context

[03:17:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: e.g. http://www.flickr.com/photos/carpeicthus/4291505464/meta/

[03:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I don't have numbers, but I'd expect human-readable data that isn't either the photographer name or keywords derived from coordinates using geonames to be exceedingly rare

[03:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: does any EXIF spec formalize the <a href> stuff seen there?

[03:18:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I think that typical photo editing software allows you to add a description to the exif

[03:18:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
hmm, <input type=image> coordinates either changed in implementations since last i tested or my testing was bogus last time

[03:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, that data seems something that anyone who'd write it in the first place would want to present as part of the HTML page to all readers

[03:19:01.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: I doubt it; that is for flickr's benefit

[03:19:02.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: It is, in this case

[03:19:03.0000] <hsivonen>
as it is presented on http://www.flickr.com/photos/carpeicthus/4291505464 for all users

[03:19:04.0000] <jgraham>
But if the photo were reused in another context it might not be

[03:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: so does anyone do it for purposes other than making Flickr extract it and show it as part of the photo page as HTML to all users?

[03:20:01.0000] <jgraham>
Of course it wouldn't tell you much about the photo apart from "it has a female model", "it was taken in nashville" and :it has complex lighting"

[03:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
jgraham: I know that the sole reason I bother with scripts that generate human-readable strings into EXIF is that Flickr extracts those on the photo page

[03:20:03.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: No idea

[03:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
I guess people only do things when they get an immediate benefit from it so perhaps not

[03:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Maybe if the photo tags were embedded in the EXIF that would be more helpful than the description

[03:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Since people might add tags for their personal use (helping them manage their photo collection) and the information would typically also be helpful in understanding the image

Why is it so hard to find a Free HTTP debugging proxy?

[03:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
This feels like the type of software that attracts open source implementations

[03:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what features would an "HTTP debugging proxy" have?

[03:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
The ability to rewrite content, cache certian files on the proxy irrespective of HTTP headers, the ability to return a local file as if it were the remote resource

[03:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
Obviously the ability to log and inspect what is going on

[03:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: it seems like a bad idea to introduce an RDF dependency to the browser platform just in case once in a blue moon an image has human-readable text in RDF

[03:30:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: frankly, talking about RDF there looks like wishful metadata handwaving

[03:30:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: see also the IRC log about EXIF

[03:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: XMP is RDF but not all RDF is XMP

[03:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I *think* XMP places restrictions on what kind of RDF you can have, but I don't know what those restrictions are

[03:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, they were only suggestions, not requirements

[03:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, hsivonen, I don't think anyone expects any embedded human readable metadata to provide ideal replacement text in context, but that's not the point of it. The point is to give more information about the user that may help the user infer some meaning based on the context.

[03:40:01.0000] <Lachy>

[04:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I feel like tosting to the ISSUE-66 thread that I think JF's reasoning has two bugs, but that would be unproductive, because I agree with his conclusion

[04:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's nice that Vimeo has now adopted <video>

[04:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
Not so nice that they only offer h.264, but I suppose that was to be expected

[04:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: nice even though it puts Opera at a disadvantage relative to Chrome?

[04:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
I meant nice in the sense that they're starting to remove their dependence on flash.

[04:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
but AIUI, it doesn't put Opera on Linux at a disadvantage, since we use gstreamer for that which supports h.264

[04:31:01.0000] <gsnedders>
We use GStreamer on all platforms, it's just we expect it to already be installed on Linux anyway and just use the system copy (with plugins, if installed)

[04:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
I didn't know gstreamer was ported to other platforms

[04:32:01.0000] <Lachy>
I've never installed it on any of my machines

[04:32:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: having not work on Linux with pristine distro plus Opera and having it not work on Windows or Mac doesn't seem so great

[04:32:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Never had anything that depended upon it installed?

[04:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think so, unless it's installed as part of VLC or MPlayer

[04:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, I must get to the airport very soon. I'm off to Prague for the weekend.

[04:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
to me, it seems that the English translation of the requests to support H.264 via GStreamer is: "We want to trade badly-performing closed-source software to patent-encumbered better performing software"

[08:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"What’s New Under the Hood for Developers: Support for the latest HTML5 specification, including the File API for local file handling"https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2010/01/21/firefox-3-6-is-now-available-for-download/

[08:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That makes it sound like they support the whole thing.

[08:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's what marketing is for

[08:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>

[08:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
HTML5, including the File API?

[08:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Sshhh or someone in the htmlwg will realise that when non-spec-junkies say "HTML5" they don't pay much attention to which document the technology is in

[08:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me should stop being such a spec junkie and stop smoking all that paper and ink

[08:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I take it in my veins.

[08:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
I didn't choose life. I chose something else. I chose specs.

Actually I saw it the other day

[09:42:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Hello Hello

[10:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me finds it fascinating that two different anonymous users changed "[[Ian Hickson]], editor of the HTML5 specification, expects the specification to reach . . . W3C Recommendation in the year 2022 or later" to read "2012" instead of "2022"

[10:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
In the Wikipedia article on HTML5, I mean.

[10:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, if it doesn't reach REC by 2012, it clearly won't have the chance to reach REC at all.

[10:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Haha.

[10:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Check if those same users changed other articles to set years to 2012?

[10:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, interesting thought.  I assumed it was just misunderstanding, but maybe people are randomly changing years to 2012.

[10:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nope, they seem to have just assumed it must be wrong.

might be wrong

[20:18:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
karlcow: Yeah, it's wrong.  The opaque-identifier portion should completely separate from the same-components section.  If they're opaque, they don't *have* components.

[20:19:00.0000] <karlcow>
TabAtkins: ah. I'll modify. It is not clear in the prose of the spec I have the feeling.

[20:19:01.0000] <karlcow>

[20:19:02.0000] <TabAtkins>

i should get a UPS

[01:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
that power outage ruined by 250+ day uptime

[01:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
(on the box linux box routing all my network traffic, which i installed about 250 days ago)

[01:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
I wonder if development of the 'uptime' program was secretly supported by the people who make UPS devices

[02:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[02:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
are UPSes any good these days? 15 years ago they could barely do 7 minutes for your typical load

[02:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, apparently not

[02:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
3 minutes?!

[02:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
5 minutes?!

[02:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
$378 for less than 7 minutes at barely 1kW?

surely something that can be put under a desk, that doesn't need to handle continuous drain-charge cycles, and that is plugged into the mains most of the day, can do better

[02:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how much petrol would be needed for a generator to support a 1kW load for an hour

[02:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
surely we have rechargeable materials with more efficient power densities than petrol by now

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was buying a printer recently and as far as i could tell, they essentially haven't improved in 10 years

[02:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
and now i find UPSes haven't improved in like 15 years

[02:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
i know chips improve, and laptops improve, and software sure has improved, and network connectivity has improved

[02:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
so wtf are the printer and UPS people doing?!

[02:14:00.0000] <erlehmann>
working on their uranium-powered printers in their secret lair ? ;)

[02:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
i hope so

[02:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
when they finally release something new, it had better be effing AWESOME.

[02:15:00.0000] <erlehmann>
like bre-pettis-AWESOME :D

[02:15:01.0000] <erlehmann>
thats it. printer people worked on adding more dimensions to their plotters !

[02:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i expect hte next gen printers to be able to print onto a whole ream of paper at once without moving any of the sheets, so that you just stick a ream in, and then you pick it up three seconds later and the whole ream is fully printed

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
DOUBLE-SIDED.

[02:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
and the next gen UPS had better just be a cable you can replace your current cable with

[02:17:01.0000] <erlehmann>
nono, they print the paper as well

[02:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
which lasts 72 hours on one charge, charges in 5 seconds, and can support 10MW loads.

[02:18:00.0000] <erlehmann>
looks like you're going for an Uranium Power Supply there …

[02:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, the comments from some of the CSSWG memebers regarding selectors api on public-webapps/www-style seem surprisingly confused about how it works.

[02:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
also about the use cases that are being addressed, but that's slightly more understandable if they haven't actively followed its development

[02:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose I should clearly document all of those somewhere, outside of the mailing list discussion, for easy reference.

[02:34:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'll put it on the whatwg wiki

[02:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, build your own UPS out of an array of car batteries. They should last quite a while, if you have enough.

[02:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could just use a laptop

[02:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://www.dansdata.com/upsupgrade.htm or http://www.dansdata.com/diyups.htm

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: the laptops didn't die, but it turns out they're useless without the wireless router and the cable modem

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: and the mac mini stops being entertaining when it, its media disk, its speakers, and its screen all go off at once

[02:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, is a mac mini particularly entertaining for some reason when it's on?

[02:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
perhaps if you use it as a media centre

[02:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's my tv replacement

[02:53:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[02:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
and music player

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
and all around entertainment system

[02:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could use laptops with one laptop acting as a wireless router, connected to the internet via the mobile phone network

[02:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also, you could entertain yourself by reading a book

[02:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
So there's really no reason to worry about power cuts at all

[02:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Well, for the book you might need some candles too)

[03:00:00.0000] <Huvet>
where can I find the documentation for html5lib?

[03:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Huvet: import html5lib; help(html5lib)

[03:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
(from Python interpreter)

[03:02:02.0000] <Philip`>
seems to be about the only documentation, given that the wiki seems to have lost its pages

[03:03:00.0000] <Huvet>
ok, thanks

[03:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: what are these "candles" you speak of

[03:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
isn't that a unit of brightness

[03:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
candles are a fire hazard, especially because you need a few hundred of them to replicate the amount of light obtained from a decent 100W incandescent bulb (or equivalent).

[03:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's possible to see quite adequately without needing the equivalent of a 100W incandescent bulb

[03:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me isn't suggesting using them as an identical replacement for current electrical lighting systems

[03:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Huvet: There is some documentation somewhere but it got lost at some point

[03:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
http://html5lib.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/UserDocumentation.wiki

[03:24:01.0000] <jgraham>
(it may not be entirely up to date)

[03:25:00.0000] <Huvet>
ah, thanks

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Do you know why that doesn't show up on the web page?

[03:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
(http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/w/list links to UserDocumentation but says page not found)

[03:32:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it's a SVN vs Hg thing?

[03:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, trying to read in rooms that have less light than that from a 100W bulb, or better yet, long fluroescent tube lighting, can get quite tiring for my eyes.

[03:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, you could use the light to illuminate the book and not the entire room

[03:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me has a 20W desk lamp that's easily more than adequate

[03:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
I know what everyone finds comfortable is different, but I can't work with desk lamps. They give an uncomfortable bright spot while the rest of the room is comparitively dark.

[03:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I guess it must be but I think it worked for a while after we switched (but I could be wrong about that)

[03:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
(however I blame Google anyway)

[03:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: You need smaller rooms

[08:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Is JF saying that if we can't be sure about author intent, we should abandon all attempts at doing anything useful?

[08:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: It's strange, but that's the vibe I get too.

[08:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm guessing it's a particular manifestation of "perfect is the enemy of good".

[08:42:00.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: I don't think so.

[08:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I can't imagine he would, but I'm having trouble reading it any other way

[08:43:01.0000] <webben>
I think he's just saying the spec should not imply feasibility of "non-existent techniques".

[08:46:00.0000] <webben>
and taking the phrase "image analysis heuristics" to imply technology that can determine author intent.

[08:47:00.0000] <webben>
I think that's a stretch, but meh.

[08:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes, that

[08:47:02.0000] <Dashiva>
is reasonable, until someone tells you that's not what it means :)

[08:52:00.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: Yeah, but even from that point, you can still make assertions that the spec's language implies something different that what is meant (or is ambiguous).

[08:53:00.0000] <webben>
Dashiva: hence his citing of a dictionary definition of heuristics, I guess.

[08:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Protip: As soon as you're citing dictionary definitions, you've lost the argument.

[08:55:01.0000] <webben>
Not really sure that's true.

[08:56:00.0000] <webben>
Not when you're discussing what does a blob of text imply, anyhow.

[08:56:01.0000] <webben>
That is, there's a difference between an argument about essences and an argument about phrasing.

[08:56:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I find that even in that sort of dicussion, whipping out a dictionary means the argument is officially over and you're on the losing side.

[08:56:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
It's like godwining.

[08:57:00.0000] <webben>
A /better/ argument, I find is to point to examples of other readers reading it that way.

[08:57:01.0000] <webben>
But - that's more expensive.

is that a bug in the spec?

[16:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't show the JSON either

[16:21:00.0000] <bzed>
hmm.why are the unit tests missing in the released file of 0.90?

[16:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hixie: Where's the photo gallery example?

[16:39:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: it does for me, perhaps it's a bug in my javascript?

[16:39:01.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: oh, that example, will check...

[16:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: btw, if you manage to get the conformance/etc changes for Microdata done, my other request would be to deal with details/figure, both to settle the HTML WG issue on it, and so WebKit is not prevented from implementing it by uncertainty

[16:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: re cut/copy/paste, I figure you can get unobfuscated source to at least some of those sites, or talk to their developers, but the additional thing I could do is make WebKit ignore attempts to set listeners for those events and see what happens

[16:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the effects might be subtle though, I know at least some Google sites use them to fix up some of the details of copy/paste in rich text editable areas to match what they like, and I don't know what failure would look like

[21:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
for the last 3 hours i have gone through the following process about 10 times:

[21:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
1. look at my emacs window. remember that i'm trying to write an example for <iframe srcdoc>.

[21:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
2. decide that the best way to do that is to find an actual blog post with comments that would be suitable for a spec example.

[21:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
3. decide a good place to find such blog posts might be a news aggregator like reddit.

[21:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
4. go to reddit fully intending to find a blog post of that nature.

[21:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
5. read reddit.

[21:57:03.0000] <Hixie>
6. forget about #2-#4.

[21:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
7. run out of posts to read

[21:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
8. decide i'm going to work on html5.

[21:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
9. goto 1.

[22:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
lol

[02:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, in the note about escaping characters in srcdoc, it says "... and then to quote all U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (") and U+0026 AMPERSAND (&) characters"

[02:12:01.0000] <Lachy>
s/quote all/escape all/

[02:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
oops

[02:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Has Adobe made any kind of guarantee that flash will remain free in the future?

[02:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not free _now_, is it?

[02:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the player is free as in beer, though, but only for end users on certain platforms

[02:38:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Free as required for the case "I want to make sure that when a child in India or Brazil or Kenya discovers the internet, there isn’t a big piece of it (video) that they can’t afford to participate in."

[02:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i do not believe they've made that guarantee, no

[02:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: is there a spec for the NPAPI?

[02:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
all i've found is https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_Plugin_API_Reference

[02:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
but if there's an actual spec, i'd love to update the reference in html5

[02:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I was thinking of that, but I can see why you wouldn't count it as a spec

[03:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's a vendor-specific reference, for one

[03:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
and seems rather vague

[03:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i mean, look at this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/NPN_GetProperty

[03:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's almost too vague to pass as an API reference, let alone a spec

[03:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it would be good if someone wrote a real spec, yes

[03:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Do all the browsers using it implement their own copy?

[03:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: I believe they use the same header files but their on code backing the headers

[03:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I guess NPAPI is a multivendor standard that doesn't have open list archives or a real spec

[03:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: HTML 4 didn't have an open list archive or a real spec, so I guess you don't need those to be a standard

[03:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
open list archives and a real spec are righteous, though

[03:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
HTML4 was almost as bad, yes

[03:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
(worse, in some respects, better in others)

[03:34:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Dashiva, the only guarantee you can have is open standards. „trusting someone“ usually doesn't work when applied to corporations.

[03:36:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There's a difference between "This is closed, but you have a free perpetual license to use it" and "This is closed, and you can use it until I tell you to stop"

[03:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
The child in India or Brazil or Kenya could just download an old free version of the Flash player, regardless of what Adobe changes in the future

[03:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and I don't think the child will care much about the details of the licensing terms)

[03:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The argument seems to be that they will

[04:01:00.0000] <erlehmann>
I fail to see what exactly how that could play a role in choosing whether to abandon Flash or not.

[04:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Because h264 is involved

[05:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, India, Brazil, and Kenya don't have software patents AFAIK, so they can use H.264 in <video>.  :)

[05:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Well, apart from Firefox refusing to let them

[05:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right.

[05:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't think third-world countries are a legitimate reason for opposing H.264 at this juncture.

[05:01:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
The impact is mainly on Americans.

[05:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Who are rich and can afford the tax for the next seven years.

[05:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
On the other hand, Flash imposes much bigger practical problems, so killing it ASAP would be nice.

[05:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
If everyone were to use Theora, that would be great, but . . .

[05:03:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me will stick to supporting Theora-only for now, but hey, GIF didn't kill the web.

[05:03:03.0000] <Dashiva>
At the current juncture, it's more a question of which is the lesser evil in the meantime

[05:03:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Pretty much, yeah.

[05:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
How many extra people can Mozilla pressure into using Theora by only supporting it?

[05:04:01.0000] <Dashiva>
How many people can they pressure into sticking to Flash

[05:04:02.0000] <jcranmer>
well, if MPEG-LA decides to require licenses for creating H.264

[05:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They can get some people to use Theora, but not so many as long as 1) authors have to maintain a Flash fallback to support old browsers/IE anyway, 2) they have to trade Firefox against Safari.

[05:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
jcranmer, if that happens, game over, we win.  No problem there.

[05:06:00.0000] <jcranmer>
I guess it comes down to IE, then

[05:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm guessing they won't charge any more than they think the market will bear.

[05:06:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE will surely hook into DirectShow or whatever, like Safari hooks into Quicktime.  Microsoft already has a video-display framework that they're invested in, why would they make up a whole new one for IE?

[05:06:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I'd say it's reasonably certain microsoft is in the h264 camp

[05:06:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The question is whether MS will package Theora codecs by default.  But like Apple, it's an MPEG-LA licensor.

[05:07:00.0000] <jcranmer>
having H264 is pretty much given

[05:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
And it has a strong historical tendency to try quashing free formats via patents.

[05:07:02.0000] <jcranmer>
the question is whether or not it takes Theora as well

[05:07:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I'd guess they won't support theora directly, but if the users installs it manually it will work

[05:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would be my guess too.

[05:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But the upshot in that case will be everyone except Mozilla supports H.264.

[05:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
And only Firefox, Chrome, Opera support Theora.

[05:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
So forget it, H.264 wins.

[05:08:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
As I say, GIF didn't kill the web.  Theora is a lot further along than PNG was, too, relatively speaking.

[05:09:00.0000] <jcranmer>
the other possibility is that MPEG-LA gets greedy, and you see a backlash like what happened with GIF

[05:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That could happen, yeah.

[05:09:02.0000] <Dashiva>
PNG had significant improvements over GIF, though

[05:09:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right, but Theora is improving.

[05:09:04.0000] <jcranmer>
Theora apparently outperforms H.264 at low bitrates

[05:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, we have Google's purchase of whatever that company is.  They might suddenly drop a new free-as-in-speech codec on everyone that outperforms H.264.

[05:10:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me can't remember its name.

[05:10:02.0000] <Dashiva>
On2

[05:10:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, well.  This stuff will mostly be decided by people with more expensive suits than us.  We get to sit and wait.

[05:10:04.0000] <jcranmer>
I personally think that the "submarine patent" argument is bull... that pretty much applies to every software technology if you look deep enough

[05:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jcranmer: That's not the real argument, though. The argument is attack surface.

[05:11:01.0000] <jcranmer>
well, let's see where Bilski goes

[05:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
jcranmer, it was more plausible before Google started deploying it.

[05:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, we'll see about that.  Maybe the Supreme Court will decide it wants to use Bilski as a chance at patent reform.

[05:12:01.0000] <jcranmer>
/me wonders if he should write his representatives to propose a "use it or lose it" rule for patents

[05:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Your" representatives

[05:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
A ban on software patents seems more likely.  "Use it or lose it" seems kind of contrary to general principles of property ownership.

[05:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Besides, it wouldn't help much.

[05:13:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
All the patent trolls would just put up some trivial implementations of everything for sale, which no one buys, and that will be enough.

[05:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
They could hide it deep inside some completely unrelated application

[05:14:01.0000] <jcranmer>
the current theory on Bilski is that it will pretty much kill business method patents but keep software patents in limbo for another case

[05:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The Supreme Court likes ruling narrowly, yeah.

[05:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Except on letting businesses buy politicians :P

[05:15:01.0000] <jcranmer>
SCotUS is also a big fan of narrowing patentability

[05:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, no, it ruled narrowly there too.  The opinion of the court said they only considered constitutionality because they had no other option, since the corporation was clearly in violation of the law as written.

[05:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I guess they could have artificially restricted themselves to not-for-profits or something.

[05:16:02.0000] <Dashiva>
But they ruled in the general case, much wider than the specific instance the case was about

[05:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yeah.  They don't rule only for one specific case, but they decide only as much law as necessary to decide that case.

[05:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So if they can reasonably make a ruling on Bilski that only covers business-method patents, probably they'll do so.

[05:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But one never knows.

[05:19:00.0000] <jcranmer>
basically, they'll probably kill the State Street test "useful, tangible result"

[05:20:00.0000] <jcranmer>
which puts software patents on shaky grounds (Diamond v. Diehr held that software per se was unpatentable)

[09:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, <iframe sandbox> sounds like a handy way to make a Flash-blocker for browsers that don't provide one (like Chrome?)

[09:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Just make a page that embeds a user-chosen URL in a sandbox that disables plugins

[09:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Interesting.

[09:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chrome has a Flash-blocker extension by now, surely?

[09:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(also, I get the best possible Flash blocking from it, namely --disable-plugins, since if I don't use that then the browser crashes all the time)

[09:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
You should use Opera, it has a handy context menu for globally disabling plugins :-)

[09:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you can find the option in a sea of three hundred and eighty-one other options.

[09:26:01.0000] <Steve^>
globally disabling isn't what you normally want?

[09:26:02.0000] <Steve^>
You want a whitelist

[09:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: The context menu only has 14 options

[09:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
Uh, probably not actually a context menu; it's just what you get when you hit F12

[09:29:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, and how many of those open up to a whole other submenu of options?  Chrome's has eight, no submenus.

[09:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: 0

[09:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
F12 doesn't do anything in Chrome, so it has zero of those.  :)

[09:30:02.0000] <Steve^>
none, actually

[09:30:03.0000] <Philip`>
(unless you count "Edit site preferences..." which opens a whole dialog)

[09:30:04.0000] <Steve^>
I've been wondering though, is Chrome too simple to be mainstream?

[09:30:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, F12 is just Tools -> Quick Preferences.

[09:30:06.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Yes

[09:30:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, Chrome still has zero prefs in that menu, so it wins for simplicity.  ;)

[09:30:08.0000] <Philip`>
but quicker

[09:30:09.0000] <Steve^>
I was spoken to a woman who was recently switched to Firefox and could no longer find her beloved File -> Email to option (apparently IE has one of those)

[09:31:00.0000] <Steve^>
How will she fare with Chrome and not even a menu bar?

[09:31:01.0000] <Steve^>
*i was speaking

[09:31:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Opera has 16 options in context menus, two of which are submenus.

[09:32:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: In my experience, most users have no idea their browser *has* options.

[09:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
To be honest, *I* have no idea what many of the options do, or at least don't care.

[09:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Steve^, I suspect that mostly, people don't mind simplicity.  Niche features like that aren't as important as a) working consistently, b) being responsive.

[09:32:03.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: I'm not sure why you seem to be arguing that Chrome wins because of its simplicity, when you've already admitted you have to use command-line arguments just to stop it crashing :-)

[09:32:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which is why I use Chrome for daily browsing.  ^_^

[09:32:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, well, I'm using the Linux beta, that doesn't count.

[09:32:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Actually, I'm on the dev channel.

[09:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It also crashes randomly when I leave it running for a while, although I can just restore, so it's not a big deal.

[09:33:01.0000] <Steve^>
TabAtkins, but that isn't an option, its a function

[09:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: We should only count mythical browsers that don't have any problems?

[09:33:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, no, you should only count the stable channel of Chrome, just like you shouldn't count Opera alphas.

[09:33:04.0000] <Philip`>
I'd prefer to count the browser versions that I would use :-)

[09:33:05.0000] <Steve^>
pardon myself for using the word option before

[09:33:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: Still something that I didn't even know IE had, nor, I suspect, do the majority of people know that it exists.

[09:34:00.0000] <Steve^>
ok, how about the print button?

[09:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Do browsers have a print button normally exposed?

[09:34:02.0000] <Steve^>
TabAtkins, but there isn't a file menu to get to it either

[09:34:03.0000] <Philip`>
(and since there seemingly isn't a version of Chrome on Linux that claims to be stable, I'd have to count the beta/dev versions)

[09:34:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
The little paper-thingy menu gets you there.

[09:35:00.0000] <Steve^>
there;s a "paper with folded corner" menu

[09:35:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Since there's only two buttons that aren't obviously navigation-related, you'll find it pretty quick.

[09:35:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, if we're talking about us, then the relevant notion of simplicity is thoroughly different.

[09:35:03.0000] <twhee>
Hello everyone

[09:35:04.0000] <twhee>
is there any documentation/samples for using python html5lib?

[09:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: I was talking about us, since you said "I" and I said "you"

[09:36:01.0000] <twhee>
http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/wiki/UserDocumentation : page not found

[09:36:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, well, then there's nothing complicated about a command-like switch.  It's the GUI I care about, and that's horribly cluttered in Opera and *extremely* slick and well-designed in Chrome.

[09:36:03.0000] <Philip`>
twhee: http://html5lib.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/UserDocumentation.wiki is what ought to be on that page

[09:36:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, if we're talking about us, I prefer open-source browsers.  :P

[09:36:05.0000] <Steve^>
TabAtkins, I hope so, I've just been wondering. Older users find the menu bar as a safe haven for finding this sort of stuff

[09:36:06.0000] <twhee>
Oh, thanks

[09:37:00.0000] <Steve^>
I quite like how Chrome still has a status bar at the bottom, when you hover a link. Unlike safari which I believe doesn't have one at all

[09:38:00.0000] <cardona507>
/me too

[09:38:01.0000] <Steve^>
and my mum is happy that it logs her into Facebook, so maybe it does have a future

[09:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I've been thinking of putting my status bar back on my work machine's firefox.

[09:38:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Steve^: Safari does have a status bar, it's just off by default

[09:38:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I like simplicity, so I removed it, and the link-icon thinger I have helps a lot, but still.

[09:38:05.0000] <othermaciej>
turning on the status bar is one of the very few changes I make to the default preference settings

[09:38:06.0000] <Steve^>
I think we can agree "off by default" is almost identical to not having a feature

[09:39:00.0000] <Steve^>
I didn't even consider looking for that

[09:40:00.0000] <othermaciej>
a transient hover overlay might be good, though Chrome's particular design looks kinda fugly to my eye

[09:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I do agree that most users don't change defaults at all

[09:41:00.0000] <Steve^>
everyone on the web seems to agree that choice is bad

[09:41:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It is.  I've been meaning to write an essay.

[09:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Chrome is really excellent about not giving people unneeded choices.

[09:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
"users don't change defaults" isn't the same as "choice is bad"

[09:42:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's one of the great things about it.  They don't say "Well, status bars are cluttery but some people like them, so let's make it an option."  They find a compromise that works well for everyone.

[09:42:01.0000] <Steve^>
just a few minutes ago people were comparing the number of menus they had in their browsers

[09:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, it does mean that you should never have a choice as a substitute for putting work into finding just the right default.

[09:43:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Give the users a choice" is often a way to avoid making a decision.

[09:43:01.0000] <Steve^>
Chrome has done well, which is why I gave it to my mum. She can type whatever she likes in that box and it'll browse the web for her

[09:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that is indeed a pathology that is common in open source projects

[09:43:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Since it shuts up all the people who don't like the default, since they're just told to change it.

[09:43:04.0000] <Steve^>
But then I use Linux and Opera, I like the other side of the scale

[09:43:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, not in closed-source projects?  I can name you examples from Windows, for sure . . .

[09:43:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like a dialog box asking you whether you want help files indexed, for crying out loud.

[09:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
almost every open source project I worked on that was supposed to be UI-oriented was very quick to reach for "let's just add a preference"

[09:44:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Apple is mostly at the opposite extreme

[09:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So is Google (including Chromium).

[09:44:03.0000] <Steve^>
Apple is a step too far, I find it difficult to find settings I need to change

[09:44:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also GNOME, although IMO GNOME doesn't do as good a job at it.

[09:44:05.0000] <othermaciej>
those are my only two experiences seeing major projects up close

[09:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Apple's design philosophy is that there should be no such thing as "settings you need to change"

[09:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
GNOME gets the "don't give a preference" part right, but forgets the "and make the default good" part . . . and also doesn't make it obvious how to change things that *are* changeable.  I'm still trying to figure out how to make Document Viewer my default PDF reader instead of scribus.  The latter isn't even installed anymore AFAICT.

[09:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, that's the right philosophy.

[09:45:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've been lucky to be dictator of all of my projects so far, so I get to decide what the best thing is and just leave it alone.

[09:46:00.0000] <Steve^>
AryehGregor, simple, replace the scribus executable with a link pointing to evince :)

[09:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It should figure almost everything out somehow.  If there are settings, they should mostly be contextual, not in some big preferences menu.

[09:46:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Steve^, haha.

[09:46:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would work.

[09:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me is fixing an HTML parser bug to atone for time-wasting mailing list posts

[09:51:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does WebKit have any plans to switch to an HTML5 parser like Gecko does?

[09:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
we'll eventually have an HTML5-compliant HTML parser

[09:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have no timeline to give on that however

[10:05:00.0000] <Steve^>
Does anyone know if Google Chromes recent blanket-advertising campaign in the UK has done much?

[10:06:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm sure Google knows.  :)

[10:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
The UK will be affected by the ballot box rolling out soon, won't it?  That will probably increase Chrome market share massively in the EU.

[10:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why is David Hyatt listed as an editor in the W3C copy of HTML5?  He doesn't actually edit it, does he?

[10:13:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: To placate people who weren't happy with having Hixie be the sole editor

[10:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's rather misleading.

[10:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sure

[10:18:00.0000] <Steve^>
I wonder what kind of web browser the iSlate will have

[10:18:01.0000] <Steve^>
if the fantasies of a reinvented personal computer experience are anything to go by, the browser is surely a part

[10:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can't imagine it would be anything but Safari, of some stripe.

[10:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe modified, like the iPhone Safari, but still Safari, surely.

[10:20:00.0000] <Steve^>
indeed, the content will be the same

[12:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.  Why doesn't HTML5 require a minimum level of image support for visual UAs?  It's realistically necessary to support certain specific images to not break the web, shouldn't the list be documented?

[12:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Surely it can't break any worse than the equivalent of network errors or 404s

[12:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, but it won't be a marketable browser.  Same as, e.g., not implementing the correct insane parser algorithm.

[12:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The latter is far more complicated, of course, so has much more reason to be specced.

[12:26:00.0000] <Steve^>
that's a good idea

[12:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I imagine it's a pretty short list, of course.

[12:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
GIF, PNG, JPEG.  BMP?  TIFF?  I'm not actually sure.

[12:28:00.0000] <Steve^>
BMP yes

[12:29:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm sure there's a dozen smaller image formats that you could argue for or against

[12:29:01.0000] <Steve^>
which is why there should be a list

[12:29:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Which is why the list will just be a bikeshed

[12:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, just make the list contain precisely the formats supported by every browser.

[12:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Same as with character encodings, that was discussed before on the mailing list.

[12:31:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(one of them)

[12:31:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could make it contain fewer, if people think a particular format isn't really needed for web compatibility.

[12:31:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
But if any major browser gets away without shipping support for a particular format, obviously that's not critical for web compat, so should be off the list.

[12:33:00.0000] <Steve^>
can a style element be placed within body?

[12:34:00.0000] <daedb>
yes

[12:34:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But usually shouldn't be, to avoid FOUC.

[12:36:00.0000] <Steve^>
FOUC?

[12:37:00.0000] <daedb>
Flash of unstyled content

[12:37:01.0000] <Steve^>
I'm looking at the HTML5 specs and it suggests that style belongs in the head

[12:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's the best place to put it.

[12:38:01.0000] <Steve^>
I'm thinking about emails and wiki pages, where I don't have full control over the document

[12:38:02.0000] <Steve^>
(I don't know what would happen in an HTML email if I put full markup in there)

[12:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then you might want it in the <body>.  It's allowed.

[12:39:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Webmail clients would probably block it, though.

[12:42:00.0000] <Steve^>
why?

[12:42:01.0000] <Steve^>
HTML emails aren't allowed style?

[12:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
<style> would apply to the whole document, including the mail interface.

[12:44:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unless they put the mail itself in an <iframe>, but without seamless, I doubt any do.

[12:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Since theey have to be fixed-size.

[12:45:00.0000] <Steve^>
oooo, that's a good point

[12:45:01.0000] <Steve^>
anyway, that isn't my concern

[12:45:02.0000] <Steve^>
I was just wondering whether it is illegal to put style in the body or just disliked

[12:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's legal.

[13:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes how htmLawed takes the approach of offering a zillion options with no indication of which ones are potentially insecure

[13:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. if you set safe=1 and cdata=3 then <![CDATA[]>]><script>alert("foo")</script>]]> will execute script in (at least) current versions of Firefox and Opera

[13:43:00.0000] <foolip>
why is it that data: URIs can't be used instead of srcdoc=""?

[13:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
foolip: Because they're a lot more complicate

[13:46:01.0000] <Dashiva>
d

[13:48:00.0000] <foolip>
really? anything apart from the escaping (which isn't complicated)

[13:49:00.0000] <foolip>
or is it just to make sure it can't work in older browsers which support data: URIs but not the sandboxing?

[13:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's the escaping

[13:53:00.0000] <foolip>
that sounds like the strangest reason to make up a new attribute ever, unless I'm missing something about escaping (encodeURL?)

[13:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
You need a URL encoding function that encodes characters like #

[13:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
and I imagine it's easy to pick a function that isn't quite right

[13:57:00.0000] <foolip>
and with srcdoc you only need to escale < and " ?

[13:57:01.0000] <foolip>
escape

[13:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes

[14:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
No

[14:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
& and "

[14:01:00.0000] <foolip>
so there's no browser that would be confused by e.g. <a href="</a>">?

[14:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
No, as far as I'm aware

[14:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It's not well-formed XML, though)

[14:02:02.0000] <foolip>
that's surprising, but good if it's true

[14:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, as long as you get the " right you're "safe"

[14:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And if you don't, then it'll most likely break visibly all over the place

[14:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
foolip: It's not just the escaping.  Legacy concerns exist too - legacy browsers that understand data: but not @sandbox will show your content without sandbox security measures.

[14:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think that using text/sandboxed-html in the data: url would fix that, though.

[14:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't think escaping is a really compelling reason here.  urlencode() should work fine here, no?

[14:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
What is urlencode?

[14:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, it's more complicated if you're writing things from scratch, but I assume you're using a normal programming language that supports basic Internet-related escape functions.

[14:17:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
PHP's urlencode(), for instance.

[14:17:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or Python/Perl/Ruby/etc. equivalents.

[14:17:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Returns a string in which all non-alphanumeric characters except -_. have been replaced with a percent (%) sign followed by two hex digits and spaces encoded as plus (+) signs."

[14:17:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode.php

[14:17:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
That would work fine, right?

[14:17:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it would look a lot uglier, and you'd have the extra data:text/sandboxed-html,<!doctype html> boilerplate.

[14:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Encoding spaces as + won't work

[14:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
See e.g. data:text/html,a+b

[14:18:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The + isn't translated to a space there?

[14:18:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then I agree it's more of a pain.

[14:18:04.0000] <Philip`>
No

[14:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
What does urlencode do with Unicode?

[14:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
You have to escape it as %20

[14:19:02.0000] <Dashiva>
That's the point, isn't it? Encoding data: is too easy to do wrong

[14:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
by which I mean: I assume urlencode doesn't do anything with Unicode, since PHP is stupid

[14:19:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It probably treats it as binary.

[14:19:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
So if the input string is UTF-8, it will encode as UTF-8.

[14:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
so I guess it's okay iff you store strings internally with UTF-8 encoding before passing to urlencode

[14:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, granted, this is more complicated than necessary.

[14:20:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The result of urlencode("…") is %E2%80%A6.

[14:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
If you do a simple replace-"-and-& encoder then you don't have to worry about encodings (or at least no more than for any other user input displayed on your site), since the input and output encodings will be identical

[14:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
(whereas URL encoding requires UTF-8 output, which is a pain if the input isn't UTF-8)

[14:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, only if you save the file as UTF-8.  Save it as UTF-16 and try again.  (Probably PHP will barf because it's not ASCII-compatible, though.)

[14:22:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Or try any other encoding.

[14:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
For literals, it just goes by the format of the file.

[14:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, I'm passing the character in through a GET param.

[14:24:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't know what the implications of that are wrt encodings.

[14:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then it probably decodes the GET param as binary.

[14:24:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
PHP just treats everything as binary.

[14:24:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's actually very simple.

[14:24:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
(Really, all I know is that when things occasionally save as Windows-1252 I get pissed.)

[14:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I certainly understand Unicode and it's encodings, but I don't understand why there has to be so many compat problems between various levels.  >_<

[14:34:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Can anyone go test Python and/or Ruby real quick to see what they do when you pass "a b" to their url escaping function?

[14:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, >>> import urllib

[14:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
>>> urllib.quote("a b")

[14:58:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
'a%20b'

[15:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
See what happens with < and " too

[15:04:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
>>> import urllib

[15:04:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
>>> urllib.quote("a b")

[15:04:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
'a%20b'

[15:04:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
>>> urllib.quote("a/b")

[15:04:04.0000] <mpilgrim>
'a/b'

[15:04:05.0000] <mpilgrim>
>>> urllib.quote("a/b", safe="")

[15:04:06.0000] <mpilgrim>
'a%2Fb'

[15:04:07.0000] <mpilgrim>
>>> urllib.quote_plus("a b")

[15:04:08.0000] <mpilgrim>
'a+b'

[15:05:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
(that's python 2.6.1, for TabAtkins)

[15:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
mpilgrim, . . . were you, like, reading the logs and came on IRC specifically to say that?

[15:05:02.0000] <Dashiva>
mpilgrim: What about " and <?

[15:05:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
yes

[15:06:00.0000] <mpilgrim>
>>> urllib.quote('a"b')

[15:06:01.0000] <mpilgrim>
'a%22b'

[15:06:02.0000] <mpilgrim>
>>> urllib.quote('a<b')

[15:06:03.0000] <mpilgrim>
'a%3Cb'

[15:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Neat, Google Reader suggested an RSS feed that contained a personal attack on me.

[15:07:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Never had that happen before.

[15:07:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Woo!

[15:07:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thanks, mpilgrim.

[15:07:04.0000] <TabAtkins>

(For extra fun, it works fine if you test with u"x" and starts throwing an exception when a user on your site enters non-ASCII data)

TabAtkins: you around?

[18:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
MikeSmith: Yo.

[18:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
hey man

[18:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I saw your message about postings being held

[18:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
that you sent to the a11y list

[18:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah.

[18:14:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
to be clear, you mean the public-html-a11y⊙wo list?

[18:14:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[18:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so I'm looking at the admin interface for that list but I don't see any messages being held for moderation

[18:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hrm.

[18:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Frex, I sent one at 16:20 GMT today, in response to the "<summary> element and Issue 32" thread.

[18:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And got an automated response from public-html-a11y-request⊙wo that my message had been sent to the list maintainer for approval.

[18:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[18:19:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
can you please forward that response to me?

[18:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'll pass it on to systems team and see if we can figure out what the problem is

[18:19:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
mikesmith⊙wo?

[18:19:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
mike⊙wo

[18:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
done

Hixie: did you fix about:blank on Friday?

[23:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: H.264 authoring for Flash is equally tollboothed and freedom-deprived as H.264 authoring for HTML5, so Flash is not free for a child in $COUNTRY in that sense

[23:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
not yet

[00:12:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: minor editorial nit - you have '<strong class="impl">Authoring requirements</strong>: ' at the beginning of the paragraph about the value attribute on the meter element

[00:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
with the colon outside the strong element

[00:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so when I flip to the author view that colon still shows up

[00:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
seems like the colon needs to be inside the strong element

[00:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: But surely it's better to depend only on h264, and not both h264 and flash

[00:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: is the term "tollbooth" in this context in wide use? I noticed Mike Shaver used it in a blog posting and you used it elsewhere recently also, but I can't recall seeing it before

[00:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or maybe I just don't read enough

[00:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I've seen it, although only for cases where you have to actually pay. Not free as in free.

[00:19:01.0000] <Dashiva>
*as in beer

[00:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: oh i thought i'd fixed those. Can you file a bug?

[00:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: I find only one that one instance of it so far, but yeah, I will file a bug for it

[00:20:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: I think "tollbooth" has been used before shaver used it, but I don't have references.

[00:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[00:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
i

[00:20:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
oops

[00:21:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, it's a good term

[00:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: thanks

Dashiva: it's not like you could now use Google properties without a Flash dependency

Google is changing, that's where all the fuss comes from.

[00:37:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes tht WebKit and Gecko support literal # in data urls

[00:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So fragments are impossible?

[00:45:00.0000] <roc>
the lack of fragment support in data: URIs is a real pain

[00:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
roc: How did it end up like that?

[00:50:01.0000] <roc>
I'm not sure, but I think it was an accident

[00:50:02.0000] <jgraham>
Ah

[00:50:03.0000] <roc>
because fragments were defined by HTTP

[00:50:04.0000] <roc>
data: URLs are not HTTP

[00:50:05.0000] <roc>
QED

[00:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me assumes the theoretical architecture where there is one and only one uri parsing function does not quite see eye-to-eye with reality

[00:52:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And the people who designed data: didn't bother to make them compatible with the best protocol ever(tm)

[01:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is a second <html> tag with an offline manifest meant to take effect?

[01:05:00.0000] <roc>
jgraham: in fact, I believe in the theoretical architecture, each scheme determines how the rest of the URI is parsed

[01:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: it seems useful to have a class of URIs whose parsing is http-like (https, ftp, etc.). too bad you can't tell from an unknown scheme if the scheme is in that class

[01:07:01.0000] <roc>
yeah

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: in text/html?

[01:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: is the spec ambiguous?

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: well, it's not ambiguous, but I'm not 100% sure that what I read is what was intended

[01:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: currently the spec supports what I want to read

[01:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
i.e. only the first <html> processes the cache manifest

[01:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
that is intended

[01:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: thanks

[01:43:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: a you aware of any known issues with the "--filter" option in anolis?

[01:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm finding at least one case where it doesn't seem to be working as expected

[01:44:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it removes an element as expected but leaves behind the text content of that element

[01:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
actually, it seems to be removing the text node that *follows* the element whose contents it should be removing

[01:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
the specific case is this:

[01:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
<strong class="impl">Authoring requirements</strong>: The <code>...

[01:46:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
that results in :

[01:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Authoring requirements<code>...

[01:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: --filter? jgraham wrote that.

[01:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hooray for lxml .tail

[01:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
gsnedders: ah.. I will ping him later

[01:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip`: hooray why?

[01:59:00.0000] <gsnedders>
MikeSmith: That'll be the cause of the bug

[01:59:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ah

[02:00:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, I need to drop off for now

[02:00:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
bbiab

[02:52:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me confesses that he wrote that code and agrees with Philip` that .tail sounds likely

[02:53:00.0000] <jgraham>
Although I don't remember the code and MikeSmith isn't here anyway so I don't really think I am contributing anything useful

[02:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so much public-html email over the weekend...

[02:59:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me can no longer keep up

[03:00:00.0000] <jgraham>
(although that is partially due to a large volume of non-public-html related things to do)

[03:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
(and, I suppose, the desire to spend some small fraction of my life not in front of a computer)

[03:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me fails to understand such desires

[03:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose it might be bearable if the time you spend not in front of a computer is perhaps behind or beside a computer, or at least in close vicinity, and you interact with it via audio

[03:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
public-html on speech synth day and night FTW

[03:14:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
should the timeupdate event skip missed frames too?

[03:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
jgraham: so I find this: http://hg.hoppipolla.co.uk/hgwebdir.cgi/anolis/file/16550726fd0d/anolislib/processes/filter.py

[03:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
def remove(element):

[03:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
    if element.tail:

[03:20:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
etc.

[03:20:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
not having any idea what lxml .tail is supposed to do, I can't tell if that's doing what it should be doing or not

[03:20:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me goes to read up on .tail

[03:21:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
isn't tail the same as dom's nextSibling if it's a text node?

[03:22:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, seems so

[03:23:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me don't understand why it wants to check the following node at all anyway

[03:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so what it seems to do is, if there's a text node following the element it wants to remove, it gets the element before the one it wants to remove, checks to see if that has a following text node, then concatenates that with the text node that follows the element it removes

[03:27:01.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan__: did I miss some discussion on timeupdate?

[03:27:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
foolip: don't think so

[03:27:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
I assume that the intent of this must be to preserve some whitespace that'd otherwise get dropped

[03:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
or something

[03:28:01.0000] <jgraham>
MikeSmith: Yes, you need to del with the case <p>This is <span>not</span> a paragraph</p>

[03:28:02.0000] <jgraham>
and wanting to remove the <span> without removing " a paragraph" 

[03:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://twitter.com/jdowdell/status/8159459869

[03:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think a node in lxml is like "<tag>text <child nodes ...></tag>tail" so I guess if you're removing the tag then the tail needs to merge into the previous sibling's tail (if any) or the parent's text

[03:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
but that seems to be exactly what filter.py is doing

[03:35:00.0000] <jgraham>
Er what Philip` said

[03:35:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me is trying to do too many things at once

[03:46:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
"INVALID_STATE_ERR or INVALID_ACCESS_ERR when attempting to write into XML documents" - hmm, are ms implementing xhtml?

[03:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe they're simply reviewing the spec, and happened to notice an inconsistency there

[03:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. it looks like Launchpad renumbers comments

[03:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so permalinks aren't perma

[04:00:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i do not like subversion

[04:00:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
at least not when dealing with thousands of files

[04:03:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't like Subversion.

[04:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Regardless of anything.

[04:07:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
also, i want foreign lands in html

[04:08:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
typing namespace decls sucks

[04:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me likes most of Subversion, except for performance and lack of networkless operation

[04:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me prefers the way hg does branch merging

[04:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or, rather, does divergent trunk clone merging

[04:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hasn't merged between "real" mercurial branches

[04:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: So you like all of subversion apart from its distinguishing features?

[04:13:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me realises this is not quite true

[04:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I like revision numbers

[04:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: I like that you can check out subdirectories and don't need the whole history and can have access control on repositories, without needing any strange and uncommon and probably-poorly-tested extensions

[04:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
and I like that its newline handling is largely sensible

[04:16:01.0000] <Philip`>
and that it has good documentation and that the command-line client makes sense and that TortoiseSVN is good

[04:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think I care much about revision numbers - hashes seem fine

[04:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders what newline handling counts as sensible here

[04:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wishes Windows had sensible newline handling

[04:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: "sensible" means you can choose which files to apply special newline handling to and it defaults to off, and then Linux and Windows clients both see native newlines

[04:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm not sure what minor variations would still count as sensible)

[04:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It'd be nice to fix Windows but it's far too late for that, so tools should do their best to cope in such an environment)

[04:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: I loathe the newline handling of subversion

[04:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
+1

[04:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Why?

[04:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also, what alternative is less loathsome?

[04:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: Because magically changing files is bad

[04:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
I want the same bytes out of the repository that I put in

[04:29:01.0000] <Philip`>
Not being able to look at files in Notepad is more bad

[04:29:02.0000] <jgraham>
Not really

[04:29:03.0000] <Philip`>
Yes it is :-p

[04:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
(particularly when it's something aimed at relatively normal users, rather than developers)

[04:31:01.0000] <Philip`>
(like the data and configuration files that are included with the program)

[04:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
When are you ever in a situation where all you have is a windows computer with notepad and you can get hold of a svn co but can't get hold of a proper editor?

[04:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me makes sure everyone knows that him and jgraham are separate person.

[04:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
s/person/people/

[04:33:02.0000] <jgraham>
If you really need windows line endings, just put windows line endings in the file

[04:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
It takes effort to find a decent editor and find out how to associate it with .txt files and context menu Edit and so on

[04:34:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: it seems like a bad idea to mangle the linefeeds in test cases and such

[06:36:00.0000] <foolip>
zcorpan__: ping

[06:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>

[06:42:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And one day we'll have an <accordion> element

[06:46:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Why not?

[06:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: legacy

[06:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How does it break?

[06:47:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
all browsers treat that as &lt;0>

[06:47:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
most likely content relies on it

[06:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and in the case of XML, it's prohibited either as some kind of SGML compat trick or as the WG imposing its aesthetics on everyone

[06:48:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
also, in xml it's not well-formed

[06:48:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
oops

[06:48:04.0000] <jgraham>

write a change proposal for the figure thing

[06:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What about <_0>, or is _ impossible to use first too?

[06:50:01.0000] <daedb>
<_0> breaks

[06:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, it's possible to use in C, and that's about as strict as things usually get.

[06:50:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
only a-z for text/html works

[06:50:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, guess not.

[06:50:05.0000] <zcorpan__>
_ works in xml though

[06:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Wow, xml being more forgiving, that's a rare event

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>

[06:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
That's fine in XML5e (though not XML4e)

<Ø> is sort for <O/>

[06:54:01.0000] <Dashiva>

[06:54:02.0000] <zcorpan__>
what's the adoption rate for 5e?

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me notices that libxml's xmllint has a "--oldxml10" option for enabling pre-5th-edition rules, which seems to express an expectation or hope that it's not going to change incompatibly again and need a --notsooldxml10 option

[06:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, XML has always allowed lots of things text/html didn't, like <p><div></div></p>.

[06:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if XML allows <𐂄>

[06:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: yes

[06:56:02.0000] <jgraham>
.me wonders if that character worked for anyone

[06:56:03.0000] <Dashiva>
The empty space? :)

[06:56:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me got U+FFFD

Make a dialect that's like HTML but using Japanese full-width character

the concept of "old XML 1.0" makes versioning look awesome

[06:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: What about Unicode 5.2 Carakan characters?

[06:58:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Who cares about old Linear B? :P

[06:58:02.0000] <zcorpan__>

[06:58:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what U+10097 is supposed to be

[06:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
The caracter description doesn't say but if I were guessing I'd go for "drag queen"

[06:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
jgraham: I got 10084.  It's a box saying that, not a character, but still.

Yeah, I need to.

[07:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suspect I could view it on my work machine.

[07:01:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
it's vital to be able to see the spec's hour glasses and jgraham's horse heads

[07:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me can't :(

[07:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me shakes fist at Ubuntu

[07:01:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/10084/index.htm

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: I think Shelley's discussion of comments is relevant for srcdoc - the sandbox feature apparently has ads as a use case, but nobody would use sandbox+srcdoc for ads, whereas it is claimed they would use sandbox+srcdoc for comments, so if sandbox+srcdoc didn't work for comments then a sensible solution would be to remove srcdoc

[07:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's true, but still irrelevant for @srcdoc itself.  She's discussing @sandbox's features/limitations.

[07:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
(not to remove sandbox, because that has other use cases)

[07:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: sandbox's features/limitations in the context of the use case which motivates the existence of srcdoc

[07:21:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yes.

[07:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
and if it's too limited to be useful then there's no longer any motivation for the existence of srcdoc

[07:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But we're not going to change @srcdoc if we find that @sandbox needs to be changed for comments.  We might remove it, but we won't change it.  @srcdoc's abilities are irrelevant.

[07:22:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Unless sandbox is conceptually useless for comments altogether.

[07:22:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me hasn't looked yet

[07:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Removing srcdoc is what she's suggesting

[07:24:00.0000] <zcorpan__>
i'm a bit skeptical about sandbox for comments -- i think serverside whitelisting is better

[07:24:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Yes, I understand.  But she's talking about @sandbox.

[07:24:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan__: Not better, I'd say.  Useful in conjunction, yes.

[07:24:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
if you use serverside whitelisting then you don't need an iframe at all

[07:24:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
@sandbox's features for limiting scripts are still quite useful, I think, even if you employ serverside filtering to remove particular things.

[07:25:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan__: Sure, but you have to be very conservative then.

[07:25:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
yes

[07:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
Server-side whitelisting is likely to have bugs, or be more restrictive than you want

[07:25:03.0000] <zcorpan__>
browsers are also likely to have bugs or be more or less restrictive than you want

[07:25:04.0000] <Philip`>
particularly if you want to allow some CSS

[07:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Server-side whitelisting is just much more complicated.

[07:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
zcorpan__: Sure, so you use both, and it's no more restrictive than the server-side whitelisting and bugs are only a problem if they coincide

[07:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's the better solution if you can be bothered, but it would be nice to be able to just write up something secure by hand in an hour.

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
You need whitelisting to stop people being irritating and filling your page with platypuses, regardless of whether the browser successfully prevents comments from stealing your admin session cookies

[07:27:01.0000] <zcorpan__>
maybe you can use an off-the-shelf sanitizer

[07:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
They're complicated and easy to misconfigure

[07:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
so they don't seem like a complete solution to the problem

[07:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, how would whitelisting stop people from filling your page with (possibly ASCII-art) platypuses?

[07:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
Nobody would object to ASCII-art platypuses

[07:33:01.0000] <Philip`>
Anyway, you could just configure your whitelist to only allow dolphins and eagles, not platypuses

[07:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I would support that.  Dolphins and eagles are much prettier than platypuses.

[07:34:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me starts argument about the plural of platypus

[07:34:02.0000] <workmad3>
platypii?

[07:34:03.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe a better example is people putting autoplaying <audio> in comments, which you'd want to prevent even though it's not an XSS vulnerability of any sort

[07:34:04.0000] <gsnedders>
workmad3: Certainly wrong

[07:35:00.0000] <workmad3>
gsnedders: most likely :)

[07:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
"Plural platypuses, platypi, (rare) platypusses, (rare) platypodes."

[07:35:02.0000] <workmad3>
I only added an extra i then :)

[07:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
"radii" has poisoned people into thinking that two i's are appropriate.

[07:36:01.0000] <workmad3>
what's the current argument about anyway? can't spot the start of it in my chat log

[07:36:02.0000] <gsnedders>
workmad3: If it were a second declension Latin noun, the norm. plural is -i

[07:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: It'd be appropriate for platypius, I guess

[07:37:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

[07:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
'platypus (plural: platypuses, or platypus; common, pseudo-latin: platypi; rare, pedantic: platypodes)'

[07:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Like all the other blatantly wrong grammar rules drilled into us as kids, I'm pretty sure that the -i plural was invented in the 19th century.

[07:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, the problem is that lots of those nouns happen to have a stem ending in -i.

[07:38:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, er, it's from Latin.

[07:38:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dates to several hundred years BCE at least.

[07:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Second-declension nouns, as gsnedders says.

[07:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Indeed it is.  The application of Latin rules to English, a language not derived from Latin in any significant way, is much more recent.

[07:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Indeed

[07:39:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, English has vast amounts of vocabulary from Latin, both directly and indirectly.

[07:39:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
"radius" is taken directly from Latin, I suspect.

[07:39:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
So are lots of other nouns like "focus".

[07:39:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Vocabulary, yes.  Not conjugations.

[07:39:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
We mug languages the world over for vocabulary.

[07:39:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
This isn't a conjugation, it's a declension.  :P

[07:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The distinction is irrelevant and meaningless to me.

[07:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I conjugate my nouns into a plural state.

[07:40:02.0000] <Philip`>
But platyp* weren't discovered until 1798, so it's not like you could ask a Roman what they'd call two of them

[07:40:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Often we use the original plural for loan words.

[07:40:04.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: But also a fair bit of Latinized Greek words, where the rules are often sutly different

[07:40:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not just in Latin's case.

[07:40:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
I doubt it would be "often".

[07:40:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Some cases.  Like "children".

[07:40:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, yes, and also some straight Greek words, or Greek-derived words.

[07:40:09.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, "child" isn't a loan word.

[07:41:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, the problem here is that Greek "pous", meaning "foot", plural "podes", got transliterated as "pus", which then looked like a Latin second-declension noun.

[07:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Like, analyse and realize where the fact that one uses s and the other uses z is because one is of French origin, and the other Latinized Greek

[07:41:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
It came straight from our German language-ancestry.

[07:41:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Much like "octopus".

[07:41:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, right.  But we have irregular plurals from loan words too.

[07:41:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sometimes, yes.

[07:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
On the other hand, the -i rule is taught as an absolute that applies to all nouns ending in -us.

[07:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Luckily we don't have too many of them.

[07:42:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's only taught that way by ignorami.  :)

[07:42:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't think anyone educated says it should be used that way.  For some words it's just totally wrong.

[07:42:04.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Much like -ise and -ize, where it's often taught that only one is right.

[07:42:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like "platypus".

[07:42:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Similarly, the occasionaly -a pluralization applied to words ending in -um.

[07:42:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
-um because -a, -a becomes -ae.

[07:42:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
In Latin, typically.

[07:42:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: You're wrong.  Plenty of educated people say it should be used that way.  They're wrong, but still.

[07:43:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The -i pluralization is, in fact, more an education tip-off than not.

[07:43:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, not educated enough, then.  :P  (Source, though?)

[07:43:02.0000] <workmad3>
for example, I'm an educated person... just not educated in english :P

[07:43:03.0000] <workmad3>
(as in all the esoteric language mechanics, not the language in general)

[07:43:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, I really doubt anyone who's not a patent moron (admittedly, there are some of those) would seriously argue that the plural of "medium" (as in someone who speaks to spirits) is "media".

[07:43:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Down here in Texas, at least, the less-educated segment of the populous typically pluralizes with the standard english rules.

[07:43:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
populace.

[07:43:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
:P

[07:43:08.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Education and patent idiocy are not antagonistic.

[07:43:09.0000] <TabAtkins>
Also: d'oh!

[07:44:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
But right, this is all a social status thing.

[07:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me notes the interesting fact that louse is irreguloar in plural in Swedish also

[07:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, education is largely a status thing anyway.

[07:44:03.0000] <jgraham>
(I have no idea what it is in the singular or plural but I do remember it is irregular)

[07:44:04.0000] <workmad3>
AryehGregor: medium - media would more likely be used by some pedantic jackass trying to prove a point rather than a moron :)

[07:44:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
In fact, the *only* people who would attempt to argue that "medium" pluralizes to "media" are the highly-educated, or those aspiring to be.  You have to be an idiot as well, of course.

[07:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
What is it that boy is in Latin? That's got fun irregularity too.

[07:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, puella is girl, right?

[07:45:02.0000] <gsnedders>
puer

[07:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right, puer.

[07:45:04.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: yeah

[07:45:05.0000] <gsnedders>
And then all the fun with hic, haec, hoc

[07:45:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'd expect puer to go puer, . . . hmm.  Not sure, actually.  It can't go like pater, patri.

[07:45:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me never actually took a Latin lesson in his life, but has picked up a bit

[07:45:08.0000] <gsnedders>
puer, puer, puer, and then something else.

[07:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
puer sounds dirty

[07:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
puer is second declension masculine with -er stem.

[07:46:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Whcih means, looking it up, -, -i, -o, -um, -o, -, -i

[07:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
And the nominative case plural is… pueri.

[07:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Common words tend to be the most irregular, in all languages.

[07:47:02.0000] <gsnedders>
In what language is "to be" regular?

[07:47:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Look at English words like "women", or "of".  Those have totally arbitrary spelling even by English standards.

[07:47:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
In my conlong.

[07:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/conlong/conlang/

[07:48:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, not in English, or Hebrew, or . . . well, that's all the languages I know.

[07:48:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Probably in Lojban.

[07:48:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
And Esperanto.

[07:48:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dunno.

[07:48:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Not in Latin, either, and that has quite few irregular verbs

[07:48:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, yeah, conlangs.

[07:49:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Latin has 10 irregular verbs, IIRC

[07:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Anyhow, I decided not to do a Eng. lang. and linguistics degree, so I am wholly ignorant

[07:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Seriously, IE?  I have to actually say style{display:none;}, or else you'll render a border around it?  Wtf.

[07:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's half regular in Japanese

[07:57:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Since they have separate verbs for predicate designation and existence :)

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
If something's half regular, that means it's not regular, which surely means it's irregular

[08:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, FF is ignoring my content-type header and interpreting this file as text/plain.  >_<  Everyone else pays proper attention to it and lets me download it, FF just barfs the binary all over the screen.

[08:06:00.0000] <gavin>
TabAtkins: what file?

[08:06:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
igofigure.com/glados/emails/DoorAccessInformation.oft

[08:06:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
for one

[08:06:03.0000] <gavin>
I get a prompt to save the file

[08:06:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
In FF?

[08:06:05.0000] <gavin>
yes

[08:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What version?

[08:07:01.0000] <gavin>
windows and mac

[08:07:02.0000] <gavin>
trunk and 3.6

[08:07:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
How weird.  Both me and my coworker are on Windows and 3.6, and we're getting the same response.

[08:09:00.0000] <gavin>
do you have a handler configured for that mime type?

[08:09:01.0000] <gavin>
(Options->Applications)

[08:09:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, but I have a "ForceType application/vnd.ms-outlook" directive in the .htaccess in that directory.

[08:10:00.0000] <gavin>
try clearing your cache?

[08:12:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
… Yeah, that was it.  I kept clicking on the same file.  Clicking on a new one works.

[08:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Good enough!

[08:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: 2/3, even, since they have separate existence verbs for animate and inanimate objects

[08:18:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Crazy Japanese.

[08:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me tries to think what aspects of Hebrew are weird.

[08:18:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The numbering system.

[08:18:03.0000] <Dashiva>
(And that's without going into all the various politeness levels, with their separate verbs)

[08:19:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's not weird, it's ripped straight off the Greeks and makes a lot of sense.

[08:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Ian just thought it was weird because he was given some crazy version modified to allow arbitrarily large numbers.

[08:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The traditional one only goes up to 999,999 in a standard way.

[08:19:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Go tell that to Hixie, who *still* can't get people to agree that the Hebrew list-style is correct.

[08:19:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Heh, you beat me.

[08:19:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
It was changed after he wrote it to a much simpler version.

[08:19:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Due to me, actually.  That was how I first joined www-style.

[08:19:07.0000] <Dashiva>
Danish numbers are also silly

[08:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Heh, that one

[08:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, are there different verbs to say that an inanimate object exists, and to *politely* say it exists?

[08:20:02.0000] <Dashiva>
The animate/inanimate distinction is removed in most cases when being polite

[08:20:03.0000] <Philip`>
English numbers are silly too

[08:21:00.0000] <Philip`>
They ought to be little-endian

[08:21:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
lolwut

[08:21:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Pssh

[08:21:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: x86 has corrupted you

[08:21:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
bigendian 4 eva

[08:21:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Danes switch to counting scores halfway to 100

[08:21:06.0000] <Dashiva>
I mean, what the hell

[08:21:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: So do the French, I believe?

[08:21:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, huh?  English numbers *are* little-endian.  The least significant digit is last.

[08:21:09.0000] <daedb>
Dashiva: Everything is silly in danish :p

[08:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
I thought no-one understood Danish numbering?

[08:22:01.0000] <Dashiva>
10, 20, 30, 40... half three scores

[08:22:02.0000] <Philip`>
When you do something as simple as addition by hand, you align the two numbers to the right and start calculating the result from the rightmost digit and carry leftwards

[08:22:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: You have it backwords.

[08:22:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
What?

[08:22:05.0000] <Philip`>
which is backwards compared to the left-to-right flow of normal English

[08:22:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
Little-endian means lsd is first.

[08:22:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
"little-endian" means "the end is small", no?

[08:22:08.0000] <Philip`>
It'd make much more sense to write the least significant digits first

[08:23:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
The little end comes first.

[08:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
As opposed to the big end coming first.

[08:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
"end" means the *first* byte?

[08:23:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
How absurd.

[08:23:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Big-Endian.svg

[08:23:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, but in division, you start from the most significant digit.

[08:23:06.0000] <Philip`>
Little-endian means you eat the least significant end of the egg first

[08:23:07.0000] <Dashiva>
But that's the outside

[08:23:08.0000] <Dashiva>
Much help you are, Philip`

[08:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, we pronounce the most significant part first, which makes a lot of sense.

[08:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
On the other hand, when reading, you do have to scan to the end of the number to figure out how large it is before you can begin pronouncing it.

[08:24:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, this flashing SHODAN is distracting.  Which is the point, of course.

[08:24:03.0000] <Dashiva>
If you use zero extension, you can do big-endian division

[08:24:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
We have to do a two-pass algorithm to read written numbers.  :()

[08:24:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
:(

[08:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's more exciting to read out big numbers starting with the least significant digit

[08:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
... I might start doing that

[08:25:02.0000] <Philip`>
It leaves the listener in suspense, waiting for the revelation of the MSDs

[08:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes, excellent plan

[08:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But that's non-standard.

[08:26:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Japanese avoids this problem by having components

[08:26:03.0000] <Dashiva>
But even there you have to scan some for bigger numbers

[08:26:04.0000] <Dashiva>
(more than 100,000)

[08:26:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Biblical Hebrew is sometimes big-endian and sometimes little-endian.

[08:26:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, well, if it's less than 100,000, you hardly have to scan much ahead in any case.

[08:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Of course, Biblical Hebrew has no digits, it just spells out the words.

[08:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, being able to stream process is still preferable

[08:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
A eight-character buffer should be sufficient for arbitrarily large numbers

[08:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe people mixed up the digit ordering in the Bible and the number of the beast is not actually 666, it's 666

[08:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, wait

[08:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, wrong Bible, too.  :P

[08:28:04.0000] <Dashiva>
I hear they mixed it up and it's actually 616

[08:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
You got it backwards, Dashiva.  616.

[08:29:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me overplays a joke.

[08:29:02.0000] <Dashiva>
You got it backwards, TabAtkins. That was the joke.

[08:29:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hoisted by my own petard!

[08:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe they got it backwards and it's really 999.

[08:33:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hey Philip`

[08:33:01.0000] <Dashiva>
When reading numbers backwards, should you say like "one forty six hundred" or "one and forty and six hundred"

[08:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suggest "one four six"

[08:34:01.0000] <Philip`>
You can insert a little pause for thousands markers

[08:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That seems inefficient

[08:35:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Since you'd have to pronounce all the trailing zeroes in large numbers

[08:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use run-length encoding

[08:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
or scientific notation

[08:37:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe I'll do a mix-endian approach

[08:37:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Sixhundred and forty-one, seven hundred thousand, twenty million, etc

[08:37:02.0000] <Philip`>
"nine e nine two point four" etc

[08:38:00.0000] <jgraham>
We could say numbers big endian and write them little endian

[08:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
How about we just say stuff totally at random and rely on telepathy for actual communication?

[08:39:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I like the mixed one. It reuses the existing terminology, but has the additional benefit of leaving the viewer with the overall magnitude fresh in mind when the number ends

[08:39:02.0000] <Dashiva>
s/viewer/listener/

[08:40:00.0000] <jgraham>
It limits you to 99 balls in the lottery though

[08:40:01.0000] <jgraham>
Since elleven one hundred could be one ball or two

[08:40:02.0000] <Dashiva>
No, 999

[08:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Digits are grouped in threes

[08:41:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm I guess that is OK

[08:42:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If needed, you could always start a number explicitly by saying "point zero"

[08:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
A lottery with 111 balls? You need to give players *some* chance of winning

[08:42:02.0000] <FireFly>
"ninety-nine and nine hundred"?

[08:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: The chance of winning depends on the number of balls selected too, not just the total

[08:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose so, but it'd be really dull if you only had to pick four numbers

[08:44:01.0000] <jgraham>
It's pretty dull already, statistically speaking

[08:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think anyone who speaks statistically is not the target audience for lotteries

[08:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You could have billions and billions of balls, and let people pick all except one

[08:46:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And then draw all except one ball

[08:46:02.0000] <Dashiva>
You'd get so many right! So close!

[08:47:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Work>
you could let them pick up to 199, but actually have balls numbered up to 200

[08:48:00.0000] <FireFly>
"choose a number between 1 and 199." "And the number is... 200!"

[08:48:01.0000] <FireFly>
(not the factorial of 200, that is)

[08:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could be like ERNIE and do a million draws per month, so surely one of them will match your number

[08:51:00.0000] <AlicanC>
does xhtml spec always follow the html spec or are they like developed (spec'd) seperately?

[08:51:01.0000] <Dashiva>
XHTML 1.0 is a delta spec

[08:51:02.0000] <AlicanC>
thanks for random fact

[08:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
With quite a few undocumented changes

[08:52:00.0000] <AlicanC>
so when html5 hits final will there be a new release of xhtml spec with <video> and stuff?

[08:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
AlicanC: If you mean XHTML5/HTML5, they're defined in the same document as different syntaxes for the same language

[08:52:02.0000] <AlicanC>
xhtml5? so the version jumps from 1.1 to 5?

[08:52:03.0000] <Philip`>
so there's (almost) no difference in functionality

[08:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
AlicanC: Consider it to be "X HTML5" rather than "XHTML 5"

[08:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
since it's basically just an XML syntax for HTML5

[08:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
rather than being an evolution of XHTML1

[08:54:00.0000] <AlicanC>
ok ty

[08:58:00.0000] <AlicanC>
this is not a technical question but, should we expect more cross-browser compatibility after the realease of HTML5?

[08:58:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes

[08:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Or rather, it's already happening

[08:59:01.0000] <AlicanC>
yeah but i still had to follow one method for each browser to capture some mouse events

[09:00:00.0000] <AlicanC>
its not really related to the HTML spec but I just thought that release of it might trigger something like that

[09:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
"release" doesn't have much significance

[09:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Browsers are mostly converging in this sort of thing, thankfully.

[09:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it's not going to change overnight.

[09:01:03.0000] <Philip`>
People are always writing specs, and people are always fixing bugs in browsers to hopefully match the specs better

[09:01:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML5 is doing a lot to weed out corner-cases where browsers diverge.

[09:01:05.0000] <Dashiva>
The IE event model is probably not going to change soon

[09:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess mouse events are a Web Apps WG thing?

[09:02:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah

[09:02:02.0000] <AlicanC>
i dont know if html specs contain stuff about events etc.

[09:02:03.0000] <AlicanC>
so it does?

[09:02:04.0000] <Philip`>
(It's strange how browsers spend lots of time with flashy videos and 3D graphics and fancy fonts but haven't bothered to get mouse and keyboard input working decently yet)

[09:02:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Only the HTML-specific stuff

[09:03:00.0000] <AlicanC>
to be honest the whole javascript is a disaster

[09:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It's not that strange

[09:03:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It's easier to invent something new than to fix a trainwreck

[09:03:03.0000] <AlicanC>
i guess theres no spec for javascript developers to follow for function naming / etc.

[09:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm sure shepazu can regale us with stories about those who tried

[09:06:00.0000] <AlicanC>
actually companies can spare some time for fixing those trainwrecks since new standartd like HTML5 and CSS3 is nearing their releases

[09:07:00.0000] <AlicanC>
and also, on the rendering side, stuff being rendered by Direct2D etc..

[09:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
HTML5 and CSS3 are nowhere near finished.

[09:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nor anywhere near fully implemented.

[09:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Even the high-profile features like HTML5 <video> still have a lot of work to be done on them in shipping implementations.

[09:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
We only just got a <video> implementation that even supports fullscreen.

[09:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me saw a Firefox 3.6 announcement saying it has the "world’s best implementation" of <video>, now with fullscreen support

[09:17:00.0000] <AlicanC>
im not saying that HTML5 will be released tomorrow and the day after, all browsers will be recoded from scratch and be shipped in cashmere CD cases with fluffy bears and kittens on them

[09:17:01.0000] <AlicanC>
no one is that optimisic

[09:17:02.0000] <Philip`>
(It seems kind of disappointing that that kind of feature is not just taken for granted)

[09:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
AlicanC: I don't think they'll be shipped on CDs - digital distribution is much cheaper

[09:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
The rest sounds good to me, though

[09:20:00.0000] <AlicanC>
i just dont want people to judge my thoughts with 100% shallowness

[09:21:00.0000] <AlicanC>
HTML 4.01 is dated 1999. if html5 is going to be released in next 1 year i call it near compared to 11 year passed

[09:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: And the fullscreen support seems rather weak, considering all the complaints I've read in blog posts about <video>

[09:23:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AlicanC: Nowadays for a spec to become a REC it needs two interoperable implementations, with a full test suite. HTML 4.01 doesn't have that after 11 years, I'd be absolutely amazed if HTML 5 did within a year or two.

[09:24:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
AlicanC, HTML5 is probably not going to have multiple, full, interoperable implementations of *every* feature for ten years.  So that's not what you should be looking for.  Look at it feature-by-feature.

[09:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
"Is <video> support in shipping browsers good enough for me to use yet?"

[09:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(if you're YouTube, evidently "yes")

[09:25:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Nice gallery links. "Older stuff" and "next page" go back in time, whereas "Newer stuff" and "previous page" go forward.

[09:25:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, I *hate* it when things work like that.

[09:25:03.0000] <AlicanC>
i wouldnt take fullscreen support into consideration

[09:25:04.0000] <Dashiva>
But it gets better

[09:26:00.0000] <Dashiva>
They're paired together "Previous page" with "Older stuff", and "Newer stuff" with "Next page"

[09:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's… That's disgusting.

[09:26:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
The pairing makes perfect sense if you pay attention to the words.  The links, though…

[09:27:00.0000] <AlicanC>
thats innovation lol

[09:27:01.0000] <AlicanC>
:D

[10:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: src is fallback for srcdoc

[10:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[10:03:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Then why bother with srcdoc?

[10:03:03.0000] <Philip`>
Saves network requests

[10:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[10:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess that makes sense.

[10:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why would you want to use a sandboxed iframe for any content you know at the time the page is being created, though, rather than whitelisting?  Only for apps that are too small to bother with whitelisting?

[10:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Could this be better solved by improved libraries?

[10:05:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: I can't parse your question.

[10:05:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, the use of a sandboxed iframe for content that's completely out of your control, like ads, makes sense to me.

[10:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, k.

[10:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But to use srcdoc, you need to have the content available to your app anyway.  You could just as well do parse and whitelist it.

[10:06:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
What's a good reason you wouldn't do that?

[10:06:03.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: It's hard

[10:06:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd certainly do that *too*.

[10:06:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I can only think of fairly weak reasons, compared to the flexibility of whitelisting.

[10:06:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
But removing scripting is difficult, while @sandbox handles it securely and trivially.

[10:06:07.0000] <Philip`>
Whitelisting can be easy

[10:06:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, so is this only a feature to compensate for the lack of good libraries in any given language?

[10:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
e.g. if you allow no HTML elements

[10:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: It's not just the whitelisting infrastructure, you also have to know what to whitelist

[10:07:02.0000] <Dashiva>
A browser knows better what's safe and what isn't

[10:07:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, a good library could do that well too.

[10:07:04.0000] <Philip`>
It's probably more compelling when you want a much wider whitelist than most blogs etc typically allow

[10:07:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, MediaWiki has an extremely wide whitelist, but we do still blacklist certain particular things.

[10:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
like you want people to embed little scripted widgets in their comments, without interfering with the rest of your page

[10:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
For instance, we don't permit <img>, but we do permit style="".

[10:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you want to allow some type of untrusted script, then it makes sense.

[10:08:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can't do server-side whitelisting of nontrivial script.

[10:08:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
But does anyone actually want this?

[10:08:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Has anyone said they'd be interested in using it?

[10:08:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
The use-cases seem weak.

[10:08:07.0000] <Philip`>
If you allow style you've got to worry about style="expression(script)" etc and it becomes far more complex

[10:09:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, actually, not that complex at all.

[10:09:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Do you happen to have a link to Mediawiki's filtering code?)

[10:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, grep for "function checkCss".  http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/includes/Sanitizer.php?view=markup

[10:09:03.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Is there a problem with using sandbox on content you believe to safe, though? Defense in depth.

[10:09:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's blacklist-based, but has worked well for years.

[10:09:05.0000] <Dashiva>
*to be

[10:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, that seems like a weak use-case.  How many people are going to bother to use srcdoc="" just for defense in depth?

[10:10:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Not just for

[10:10:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does anyone here have any particular cases where they, personally, would actually want to use srcdoc?

[10:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
srcdoc has its own uses, e.g. reducing network traffic

[10:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Once you're using srcdoc, sandbox is free

[10:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
By "srcdoc" I mean "sandboxed iframes where you could plausibly use srcdoc".

[10:11:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Does anyone have a case where you'd want to use a sandboxed iframe rather than server-side sanitizing?  Or in addition to server-side sanitizing?

[10:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(as opposed to cases where server-side sanitizing is impossible, I agree sandbox makes sense there)

[10:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've already provided a case where I'd want to use it in addition to server-side processing.

[10:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, eight lines, doesn't seem too complicated.  Found any problems with it yet?

[10:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, which is what?  And do you want it enough for it to be worth implementers spending time on it rather than other features that give you things you can't have right now at all?

[10:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: I do think the case for srcdoc is somewhat weaker than for sandboxed iframes in general

[10:14:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, background-image: attr(title, url) is a problem, but happily, not implemented yet anywhere.

[10:14:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Simplest one is trusting that there really is no scripting going on, as history shows that people are very clever at slipping stuff through sanitizers.

[10:14:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, I don't think we've ever had anything get through the MediaWiki sanitizer.

[10:14:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not since very early days, anyway.

[10:15:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Still, every high-profile XSS case is high-profile precisely because it slipped through sanitizers.

[10:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
We've had the usual XSS stuff, but I don't think any were because of the sanitizer misbehaving.

[10:15:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I might be wrong, though.

[10:15:03.0000] <karlushi>
/me sees big wreckage at the horizon in terms of ugliness of the pages. :) I think we will be surprised by the creativity of people using srcdoc

[10:15:04.0000] <othermaciej>
one key difference that I guess I have been overlooking is that srcdoc has a different fallback model

[10:15:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, XSS is caused by a totally different failure, usually.

[10:15:06.0000] <othermaciej>
namely that you get a dead iframe box instead of your desired content

[10:15:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
XSS is typically when something is being injected into trusted content and isn't escaped at all.

[10:15:08.0000] <othermaciej>
XSS does in fact occur because of bad sanitizers

[10:16:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I'm sure it does sometimes, but that's not the leading cause, unless you construe "sanitizers" very broadly.

[10:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
remember the MySpace worm?

[10:16:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, I don't touch social networking sites with a ten-foot barge pole.  :P

[10:16:03.0000] <othermaciej>
http://namb.la/popular/tech.html

[10:16:04.0000] <othermaciej>
that was a rather spectacular failure of filtering

[10:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if your favorite content filter has considered this attack vector...

[10:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
othermaciej, IMO, any useful whitelisting system has to whitelist URL protocols.

[10:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That seems like MySpace's failure here.

[10:27:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(MediaWiki simply prohibits URLs everywhere in CSS.)

[10:27:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, yes, whitelisting is hard to get right.

[10:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
AryehGregor: I'm betting they did whitelist URL protocols, they just didn't think about URLs inside CSS

[10:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I guess some people might want to use srcdoc.

[10:28:02.0000] <othermaciej>
point is, a sandboxed iframe would have neutralized this attack

[10:28:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(I'm not sure that you'd specifically need srcdoc for it)

[10:28:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
It depends how much was sandboxed, no?

[10:28:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Where was the code injected, exactly?

[10:28:06.0000] <othermaciej>
In a user's profile page (controlled by that user)

[10:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in one of the many parts where MySpace lets you provide the content

[10:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess it doesn't matter, you just have to split it up into "script allowed" and "script not allowed" and make sure all user-provided content is in the latter pigeonhole.

[10:29:02.0000] <othermaciej>
social networks are probably a more realistic and interesting use case for sandboxed iframes than blog comments

[10:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wikis would be similar.

[10:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in fact, even a sandboxed iframe with allow-script on would have prevented the worm aspects of this attack

[10:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and this is just one of the most well known breakdowns of whitelisting because it got so bad that it affected backbone traffic....

[10:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, all I want for Xmas is a way to link a <input type=file> to a <progress> trivially and declaratively.

[10:32:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, so this has some reasonable uses.

[10:32:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, that would be cool.

[10:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would actually make <progress> useful.  :P

[10:33:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I keep having to screw around with various different uploaders solely so I can provide a progress bar, and none of them are without issues.

[10:33:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, I guess <progress> isn't really useful until it's style-able.

[10:33:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
What I want to know is, why the heck don't browsers provide progress bars for uploads themselves?

[10:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
They provide them for downloads.

[10:34:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I don't care all that much, actually.  Set the attributes on it, and fire progress events that I can capture to handle the styling myself.

[10:35:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Seriously, some simple upload indicator in the browser UI would fit my needs perfectly too.  I just can't have customers uploading 50+MB files without some progress indicator.

[10:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=249338

[10:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you are willing to do all the drawing of the progress bar completely yourself, then at least in Safari you can give good progress UI

[10:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
just use <input type=file> to pick one or more files, and XHR to upload, and listen for its progress events

[10:38:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Would that work in any browser supporting the File API?

[10:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Looks like it works in FF too.

[10:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
But, of course, I need IE7 support.

[10:44:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hm, apparently YUI can handle it.  Interesting.

[10:45:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
In pure JS?  How, I wonder?

[10:45:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's a great question.

[10:45:02.0000] <Bo>
Hi! how's html5 going? will it make flash extinct?

[10:45:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Bo, yes, just give it a few years.

[10:45:04.0000] <Bo>
cool! good luck guys!

[10:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I predict that in two years, normal people using new browsers won't need to have Flash installed.

[10:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me just made up that prediction off the top of his head

[10:46:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
To be fair, I should check whether I was right.

[10:52:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: I bet YUI uses Flash

[10:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: Flash is (sadly) the canonical solution for AJAXey file upload, upload progress, and e.g. multi-file selection

[10:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know - that's what I'm using now, but apparently not a good one.

[10:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it would be nice to have a JS lib that can use HTML5 + XHR2 when available and fall back to Flash

[10:56:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Indeed.

[10:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Huh.  nixbox.com/demos/jquery-uploadprogress.php doesn't seem to use any flash, and it works in IE8 at least.

[10:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Java?

[10:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Nah, php.

[10:59:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean: client-side Java?

[10:59:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, it uses an uploadprogress PECL plugin.

[10:59:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
(instead of Flash)

[10:59:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, I see.

[10:59:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right, that works.

[11:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could just get the upload progress from the server.

[11:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Kind of stupid, but . . .

[11:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but you can't do that by default with PHP.  It slurps the whole request before running the destination script.

[11:00:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right, but I mean in principle, that's an alternate approach you could take.

[11:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have a working uploader that uses perl to do it, but I had way too many problems getting it to run.

[11:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Since you often control the server completely.

[11:01:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
So you can deploy whatever you want there, in theory.

[11:06:00.0000] <erlehmann>
gsnedders, you should blog moar. me likey

AryehGregor: I put up some ideas for improving sandbox for comment use.  Can you see any other major areas we could possibly hit, based on your mx experience?

s/mx/mw/

[12:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, I'll probably look at my spec e-mail tomorrow.

[12:58:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
k.  just for reference, it's in the whatwg thread about sandbox.

[13:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me *facepalms*

[13:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
Where on earth did anyone get the idea that sandboxing had anything at all to do with protecting against SQL injection?

[13:01:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
From Shelley.

[13:01:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
And now she's confused Leif.

[13:01:04.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but where the hell did she get it from?!

[13:01:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have no idea.

[13:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's as if they have no clue about the security issues involved, and are just arging for the sake of arguing

[13:02:01.0000] <Lachy>
and also, why are all the arguments that are supposedly against srcdoc, actually solely focussed on sandbox?

[13:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because of your previous line.

[13:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
well, the one argument against srcdoc is that markup in attriubtes is an anti-pattern, which is somewhat true, but unavoidable in this case.

[13:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The other question is how useful it is, really.

[13:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, seriously.  If someone is posting things that don't make much sense, don't respond to them.  If they make any good points, someone else will make them too, and you can respond to the other person.

[13:05:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's no point in getting into a debate where both sides are talking past each other.

[13:06:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Markup in attributes is an anti-pattern, but I'm not seeing why data: urls are any better.  Same thing, just a different attribute and different escaping requirements.

[13:06:01.0000] <Lachy>
wow. It looks like Shelley doesn't even understand what SQL injection actually is.

[13:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
She doesn't do server-side development, does she?

[13:07:01.0000] <Lachy>
or, at least, she's confusing SQL injection with embedding malicious client side scripts in user input

[13:07:02.0000] <Lachy>
I don't know what she does.

[13:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Restarting apache is enough to get php.ini changes to be recognized, right?

[13:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: No, you have to format your disk and reinstall from scratch

[13:15:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Damn, okay.

[13:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I'd expect it to be fine with just a "apachectl graceful", though maybe PHP is stupid and doesn't work with that)

[13:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It does.

[13:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
graceful restarts everything, it just lets all currently-running requests run to completion before replacing their worker process.

[13:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
are there any use cases for srcdoc that wouldn't call for sandboxing too?

[13:32:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Not really, I think.

[13:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could use it to reset styles

[13:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
or to do little scrolly windows without having to learn the CSS syntax for it

[13:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
You could use it for pages containing lots of test cases that run independently

[13:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
In other words, no.  :P

[13:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
using it to reset styles doesn't seem like a compelling use case, since you'd most likely want to specify it with seamless, so that the parent document's styles are applied to the iframe's srcdoc document.

[13:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
if you don't specify seamless, then you just get an ordinary iframe

[13:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
You get an ordinary iframe without the effort of making a separate file for it

[13:54:00.0000] <erlehmann>
TabAtkins, may I ask what problem srcdoc solves that data URIs don't ?

[13:54:01.0000] <erlehmann>
I mean, I read the example but am obviously a bit confused.

[13:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
They solve the same problem, but data urls are slightly different in ways that are annoying.

[13:56:00.0000] <erlehmann>
Okay. Thought I had missed a beat or something.

http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/betadesign/Versioning.html versioning on S3

[16:17:00.0000] <jwm>
I have an easy question.. can you make an entire canvas area scale pretty well?

[16:18:00.0000] <jwm>
I am designing an UI that I would like to have scale from 2560x down to smartphones

[16:18:01.0000] <jwm>
of course content will be added/removed to make things fit but I'd like to have the entire window scale also

[16:20:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
jwm: Yeah, <canvas> scales just fine if you, say, use CSS to resize it.  It depends on whatever the browser's native scaling algorithms are, of course.

[16:20:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Alternately, you can handle the scaling yourself using whatever algorithm you wish.

[16:21:00.0000] <jwm>
cool

[16:21:01.0000] <jwm>
that is good news

[16:22:00.0000] <jwm>
I want to mimmic webos kind of hehe

[16:22:01.0000] <jwm>
in my interface

[16:22:02.0000] <jwm>
not sure if canvas or svg or just regular xhtml/css would be good enough

[16:22:03.0000] <jwm>
hehe

[16:22:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
HTML/CSS with 3d transforms!

[16:22:05.0000] <jwm>
hehe

[16:22:06.0000] <TabAtkins>
It'll only work in Safari, but it'll be beautiful!

[16:23:00.0000] <jwm>
hah

[16:26:00.0000] <jwm>
I guess regular web tech xhtml/css will do what I want to do

[16:26:01.0000] <jwm>
was just trying to figure out what to use for graphics to rescale them

[16:26:02.0000] <jwm>
hehe

[16:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
<canvas> never does nice automatic scaling

[16:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
The size of the bitmap is determined by the width/height attributes on the element (possibly multiplied by a constant), and it does usually-ugly resampling to match whatever size CSS tells it to render at

[16:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
and you'd have to do some manual work if you want the bitmap dimensions to match the rendered size

[16:33:01.0000] <jwm>
crap

[16:33:02.0000] <jwm>
ok

[16:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
SVG is probably much more appropriate for scalable graphics, if you don't need canvas's immediate-mode API

[16:38:00.0000] <jwm>
yeah but it seems canvas has a lot more steam behind it

[16:38:01.0000] <jwm>
hehe

[16:38:02.0000] <jwm>
totally different things I know

[16:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Steam doesn't seem so important, what matters is the functionality they provide

[16:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and they're not going to provide functionality much different to what they provide today)

[16:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders how his IMAP server ended up with a "INBOX.INBOX.INBOX.INBOX.INBOX.Apple Mail To Do" folder

[17:01:00.0000] <jcranmer>
google hates you

[17:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
jcranmer: google?

[17:06:00.0000] <jcranmer>
oh, you're not using GMail? ;-)

[17:07:00.0000] <jwm>
hehe

[17:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
jcranmer: i am, but this isn't the gmail IMAP server in this particular case :-)

[17:12:01.0000] <jcranmer>
well, it's still fun to poke at gmail

[18:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

patch to make anolis --filter option work as expected

[18:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
summary: use element.drop_tree() instead of element.getparent().remove(element)

[18:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
actually, I guess you might as well just do:

[18:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
 http://pastebin.ca/1766045

[18:40:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
get rid of the remove(element) function altogether

wait

[20:44:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
hey guys what was that site that shows off html5 sites

[20:44:01.0000] <jwm>
google

[20:45:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://html5gallery.com/

[20:45:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
:D

[20:45:02.0000] <jwm>
:)

[20:46:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
boaz in the ot told me

[20:46:01.0000] <jwm>
if you just type html5 sites

[20:46:02.0000] <jwm>
into google

[20:46:03.0000] <jwm>
it's the first result

[20:46:04.0000] <jwm>
:)

[20:47:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
I searched for "sites running html 5"

[20:47:01.0000] <jwm>
ohh

[20:47:02.0000] <jwm>
if you searched for html5 sites

[20:47:03.0000] <jwm>
then it'd of pulled it

[20:47:04.0000] <jwm>
just like you typed :)

[20:52:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
jwm, i'm sorry i didn't jfgi right

[20:52:01.0000] <jwm>
haha

[20:52:02.0000] <jwm>
nah I didn't mean that mean

[20:52:03.0000] <jwm>
I seriously didn't know where it was either

[20:53:00.0000] <jwm>
I don't understand what a html5 site would be

[20:53:01.0000] <jwm>
other than for inclusion of canvas and tables

[20:53:02.0000] <jwm>
hehe

[20:54:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
http://www.liferay.com/

[20:54:01.0000] <JonathanNeal>
we're all html'd up, well except that we have no need for canvas yet.

[23:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
How is about:blank going?

[23:23:00.0000] <jwm>
heh

[23:23:01.0000] <jwm>
getting there

[23:23:02.0000] <jwm>
maybe some day

[23:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: so do I read mnot's comments correctly, the resolution of the rel-registry license sub-discussion is that it will in fact carry an MIT license?

[23:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: so it seemed, but I still have messages on public-html that I need to read and reply to

[23:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: fwiw, if Mark has gotten agreement from whomever else he talked with off-list, it doesn't seem necessary to respond any further to Roy's messages asserting that no license is necessary

[23:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: ok

[23:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
hsivonen: well, just imho

[23:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
MikeSmith: understood

[23:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, if the rel registry will in fact have an explicit license, it seems like a case can been made for adding the same or similar license to the language-subtag and character-encoding-name registries

[23:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah

[00:35:00.0000] <jwm>
can you make bitmaps scale inside of canvas?

[00:35:01.0000] <jwm>
without javascript

[00:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
jwm: You can't use canvas at all without JS

[01:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Boo. Prototype uses browser sniffing :-(

[01:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I thought these canned JS libs were supposed to do things the Right Way

[01:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(with feature sniffing)

[01:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
hsivonen: IIRC MooTools uses browser sniffing too

[01:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
(or at least it changes the expected results of at least one of its tests based on whether it thinks you are Opera or not)

[02:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: All the major libraries do

[02:10:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Sometimes with broken codepaths for some browsers, which lead to failing tests that they obviously don't care about.

[02:11:00.0000] <krijnh>
Whoops, somebody changed my IP :/

[02:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me blames krijn

[02:13:00.0000] <krijnh>
/me blames his little brother

[02:13:01.0000] <krijnh>
But I think the interwebs are faster now

[02:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>
The tubes you have now less blocked?

[02:15:00.0000] <krijnh>
Got a new connection, hope it improves /irc-logs/ speedyness :)

[02:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. does WebKit save the form element source order for submission order instead of relying on the DOM order?

[07:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All right, so, data urls vs @srcdoc.  What are the problems again?  (I'll list the ones I know, see if I missed any before I send this email.)

[07:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
1) data urls will work in current UAs that don't understand sandbox, thus "failing open".  Will the sandboxed html mime type help with this?

[07:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
2) data urls have more difficult escaping requirements.  Possibly not.  PHP escapes things correctly with rawurlencode, python also has a built-in function that will do it properly.

[07:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
3) ?

[07:39:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
1) Yes, sandboxed HTML MIME type should solve that problem, I think.

[07:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Maybe something with origins?  data urls are automatically unique-origin, right?  Could @sandbox=allow-same-origin just special-case override that?

[07:39:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
3) You can save some annoying boilerplate with srcdoc="".

[07:39:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just the "text/html;charset=utf8" bit, right?

[07:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And the doctype

[07:40:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, right.  And <title>.

[07:40:02.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: IE < 8 is still normally a consideration, IE8 is limited to 32KB

[07:40:03.0000] <gsnedders>
(or maybe KiB?)

[07:40:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
what's the limit on IE<8?

[07:40:05.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: they have no data uri impl

[07:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, well then.  That's not a big deal, then, because they don't have a @srcdoc impl either.

[07:41:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I also dispute 2)

[07:41:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But 32kb.  That may be an issue.

[07:41:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Sure, PHP has _a_ function that does it right

[07:41:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: Dispute how?

[07:41:05.0000] <Dashiva>
But it's hardly given that people will choose the right one

[07:41:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
You don't really need to include <title>.

[07:41:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
And one that does it wrong in an immediately obvious (but not security-relevant) way.

[07:42:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean, the very first comment I see that looks like "First+post+LOLOLOL", I'll know something's wrong.

[07:42:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, I don't think the existence of urlencode() is a big deal.

[07:42:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, if you use that one

[07:42:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Are there other url-encoding functions in PHP that we expect authors will use?

[07:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
urlencode()?

[07:43:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I wouldn't be surprised if people tried with the html* functions too

[07:43:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's the one I just mentioned.

[07:43:03.0000] <jgraham>
/me assumes authors will use my_broken_url_encoder()

[07:43:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
htmlspecialchars?  Hmm.  I wonder how quickly that would fail.

[07:43:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, as long as it fails in an obvious way, it's not a big deal, you can't get much better than that.

[07:43:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Some people will try urlencode() on srcdoc too.

[07:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Yes, but then we have to first verify that all the obvious functions do fail in an obvious way

[07:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
We can't just assume they will

[07:44:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
The same goes for srcdoc.

[07:44:03.0000] <gsnedders>
urlencode/rawurlencode are a lot easier to mix up though

[07:44:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
But the wrong one fails quickly and obviously, so I don't think we have to worry about it.

[07:44:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
And fails in a way that doesn't compromise security.

[07:44:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Sure, I know that urlencode encodes \x20 as + and rawurlencode encodes it as %20, but most authors don't.

[07:45:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Most authors will use urlencode, see lots of +s in their page, and google for it.

[07:45:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
They'll figure it out pretty quickly.

[07:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not a big deal.

[07:46:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders why browser release announcements seem to select benchmarks at random to show how much their performance has improved . . . do they just pick the most favorable one?  A recent Chrome announcement gives improvement on "Mozilla's Dromaeo DOM Core Tests", previous ones have used SunSpider, V8's crazy tests, . . .

[07:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, neat, Chrome 4 supports STS.

[07:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: Kind of like how every new car was "car of the year" in at least one car magazine

[07:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, can anyone think of something I can put in a data url that will pass through htmlspecialchars unscathed and cause problems?  By default, it escapes <>"& (not ').

[07:49:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, ' will cause problems, if the attribute uses ' instead of " for quoting.  :)

[07:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, but it fails even quicker than @srcdoc will if you forget to escape the ".

[07:49:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because people use ' all the time.

[07:49:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
"HTML5: Notifications, Web Database, Local Storage, WebSockets, Ruby support" <-- How many of these are actually part of HTML5?  Maybe Ruby support?  Is Notifications even a vendor-neutral spec?

[07:49:04.0000] <gsnedders>
But with larger security issues

[07:49:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: Yes, but with identical security issues to @srcdoc.

[07:49:06.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Most of them _used_ to be HTML 5

[07:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess "HTML5" just means "cool new web features anyway".

[07:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
All apart from Ruby were originally HTML 5.

[07:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
We should rename the HTML5 spec to "Some Random Subset of HTML5" to reflect common usage.

[07:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
I thought IE8 only supports data: for images, not HTML pages

[07:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
so its length limit is irrelevant

[07:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: # breaks data: in Opera but not other browsers, I think

[07:53:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, Opera treats stuff after a # as the URL fragment, right?

[07:53:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Really annoying.

[07:53:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is there a spec that says whether that's right or wrong?

[07:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Huh.  Something's breaking my page in IE, and causing it to navigate to one of the data urls.

[07:55:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Does IE8 'do' data urls in iframe @src?

[07:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: I thought IE8 only supports data: for images, not HTML pages

[07:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Possibly.  Which means we can ignore the size limits of IE8, which is good.

[07:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
(It basically does the minimum needed for Acid2)

[07:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
IE8 doesn't support sandbox anyway, obviously, so who cares about it in this context?

[07:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
We have no backward compatibility here anyway.

[08:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Yeah, but we have to be careful about, frex, resource sniffing.

[08:00:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm?

[08:00:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wouldn't want IE to sniff a text/html-sandboxed page as text/html.

[08:00:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Will it

[08:00:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
?

[08:00:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
That seems unrelated.

[08:01:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know they sniff resources for html-ness normally.  Of course, their complete lack of support for pages in data: urls means we don't have to worry about it.

[08:01:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
IIRC, it's somewhat difficult to serve html as text/plain to IE?

[08:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Shelley is planning on filing several thousand change requests?

[08:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, they only sniff for certain MIME types, IIRC.

[08:02:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Okay.

[08:02:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
Dashiva: Eventually, probably.

[08:02:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think someone tested this, no?

[08:02:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
I have no idea.  I'm relying on hazy recollections.

[08:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Mark Pilgrim's lastest WHATWG blog post says no current browser will execute text/sandboxed-html.

[08:03:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Just doing some calculations based on http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jan/1308.html

[08:03:02.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not aware of anyone testing it thoroughly

[08:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wouldn't count unevidenced statements in blog posts as being particularly meaningful

interesting note from bengee - http://bnode.org/blog/2010/01/26/microdata-semantic-markup-for-both-rdfers-and-non-rdfers

[08:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
When opera breaks on unescaped #, it's an innocuous break, right?  Just a malformed page, not busting content out into attributes?

[08:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
Interesting. "Atom, microformats, OpenID, Portable Contacts, XRDS, Activity Streams, these are all examples where RDFers tried, but failed to promote some of their infrastructure into the respective solutions"

[08:13:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Work>
I just noticed that HTML5 still doesn't me mark up inline lists. <p>I went shopping for <ul><li>lightbulbs,</li> <li>widgets,</li> <li>flozzbots and</li> <li>some milk</li></ul>, but I got distracted and ended up in the pub.</p>

[08:13:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Sure it does.  ul,li{display:inline;}

[08:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, it just treats everything after # as the fragment portion of the URL, AFAIK.

[08:14:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, not in <p>.

[08:14:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Cool, so that's innocuous.

[08:14:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Ah, you're right.  Silly me.

[08:14:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
GarethAdams|Work, you can't put <ul> inside <p> in text/html, it's not compatible with legacy browsers.

[08:14:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
I always forget about <p>'s silly self-closing rules.

[08:14:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
That causes me problems sometimes.

[08:14:06.0000] <Philip`>
GarethAdams|Work: Why not write it like "<p>I went shopping for lightbulbs, widgets, ..."?

[08:14:07.0000] <Dashiva>
Also, <li> has a horrible delimiter story

[08:15:00.0000] <Dashiva>
E.g. if you want a list like apples | bananas | other fruits

[08:15:01.0000] <GarethAdams|Work>
ah, legacy browsers, shoulda guessed

[08:15:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
GarethAdams|Work, "legacy" meaning "all".

[08:15:03.0000] <GarethAdams|Work>
yeh

[08:15:04.0000] <GarethAdams|Work>
I forgot about the backward compatibility

[08:15:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, it's part of text/html parsing rules that <p>Foo <ul><li>Bar inserts </p> before the <ul> (effectively).

[08:15:06.0000] <GarethAdams|Work>
schoolboy error

[08:16:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Work>
Dashiva: the delimiter problem is down to bad support for `:after` and `content:` in CSS though

[08:17:00.0000] <Dashiva>
GarethAdams|Work: That's still a bad story

[08:17:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You need special casing for first/last element, etc

[08:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"There is a great deal of contention about the new srcdoc attribute."

[08:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you count number of emails, there has

[08:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe not so much if you count people

[08:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe ask Sam to revive the frequent poster statistics

[08:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
So, the issues are (1) fail open, (2) harder escaping, (3) boilerplate, and (4) unique origins?  Anything else?

[08:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
URL size limit, potentially. We won't know until the future browsers are released, though.

[08:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
True, I'll bring that up.

[08:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Also, there's the dual source thing

[08:23:01.0000] <Dashiva>
With srcdoc, you can use src you provide fallback for browsers that don't support it

[08:23:02.0000] <Dashiva>
*use src to

[08:28:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Right.

[08:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe we should use the Cooke method in the HTMLWG: http://www.rff.org/News/Features/Pages/The-Cooke-Method-A-Route-to-More-Reliable-Expert-Advice.aspx

[08:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, you have to manually clean the @src content, which makes it kind of redundant.

[08:29:01.0000] <Dashiva>
No, you wouldn't clean it at all

[08:29:02.0000] <Dashiva>
It would say "Your browser doesn't support secure iframes, please upgrade or something, I don't know"

[08:30:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Haha.

[08:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, browsers could just as well have a srcdoc size limit.

[08:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Future ones, I mean.

[08:30:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Could, but that hasn't been demonstrated yet.

[08:30:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nor have limits on data URL length for sandboxed iframes.

[08:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
AryehGregor: There already are quite real limits on data URLs, though. It's not a matter of possibly breaking, it's a matter of breaking unless it gets fixed.

[08:33:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Introducing a whole new attribute and hoping there won't be comparable length limits seems like a roundabout way to address the problem.  You could just mandate a minimum length for data URLs.

[08:33:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, minimum maximum supported length.

[08:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's not a way to address the problem, it's a way to address lots of different problems

[08:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is unconvinced.

[08:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
Has anybody pointed out use cases for srcdoc other than blog comments?

[08:35:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Wiki pages.

[08:35:03.0000] <Philip`>
Things like 32KB length limits aren't really a concern in those cases

[08:36:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Virtually all cases where untrusted users are uploading something you want to display.

[08:36:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor, any idea how big the largest page on wikipedia is?

[08:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
In most cases users aren't uploading HTML, so you just escape all "<"s and you're done

[08:36:03.0000] <Lachy>
personally, I'm not yet convinced of the use cases for srcdoc either

[08:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm composing an email with a lot of discussion about data urls, their problems, and their possible solutions.

[08:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
but I think it would suck if pages like wikipedia started putting entire articles into srcdoc

[08:37:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, in bytes?  Actual articles or also maintenance pages and such?  I wouldn't be surprised if the largest article is 1 MB

[08:37:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
.

[08:37:04.0000] <Philip`>
so it's only cases where users are uploading some subset of HTML, but a large enough subset that decent filtering is hard

[08:37:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Yeah, in bytes, and any page where you'd show untrusted user content, potentially via a sandboxed iframe.

[08:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Philip`: Also, just the fact that you can guarantee that no scripts slip through your genius filtering is nice.

[08:38:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
This is a feature for a use-case that's kind of marginal to begin with, and data: URLs would work okay for it, so I really don't see what the point is.

[08:38:02.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: If your filter just allows <b> and <i> and <a href> and nothing else, then you don't really need to worry about that

[08:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
If your filter is good enough to avoid all the crazy shenanigans hackers get up to.

[08:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I just plain distrust filters.

[08:40:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
1) htmlspecialchars() 2) strtr( array( '&lt;b&gt;' => '<b>', '&lt;/b&gt;' => '</b>', ... ) )

[08:40:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Pretty hard for that to go wrong.

[08:40:02.0000] <jgraham>
Famous last words

[08:40:03.0000] <Lachy>
if you use proper HTML parsing, rather than a regex, and a whitelist that checks elements, attributes and attribute values (to e.g. disallow href="javascript:..."), then server side filtering should be sufficient

[08:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: And what major blogging package does this?

[08:41:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't think I would choose to use srcdoc on my own blog

[08:41:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Nobody uses proper HTML parsing.

[08:41:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's no such *thing* as proper HTML parsing prior to HTML5.

[08:41:04.0000] <Lachy>
I'm hoping that will start to change now that HTML parsing has been defined properly

[08:41:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yes, true.

[08:41:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Parsing html in PHP is prohibitively slow.

[08:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
There's been proper HTML parser libraries long before HTML5 existed

[08:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why would people use HTML5 parsers when they haven't used those ones?

[08:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
(given that for blog comments you don't care about legacy compatibility, which is the only thing HTML5 adds)

[08:42:03.0000] <jgraham>
s/HTML/XML/ and you end up with the same conclusion

[08:42:04.0000] <gsnedders>
PHP5 has access to libxml's HTML parser, and nobody uses it.

[08:42:05.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, yes, I know. I don't think I would use PHP for a CMS. It's not a well designed language

[08:42:06.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Yet the majority of CMSes on the web do.

[08:42:07.0000] <TabAtkins>
Argh, I find it ironic that Richard's emails about Canvas accessibility are almost unreadable to me because he uses HTML emails in some crazy size.

[08:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I know they do

[08:43:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: What you personally would ues is irrelevant.

[08:43:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, you would use PHP for a CMS if you wanted it to be as widely used as possible.

[08:43:03.0000] <jgraham>
(i.e. people don't always use XML parsers when producing XML, to oftentimes hillarious effect)

[08:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
AryehGregor, yeah, I understand that's why PHP is so common.

[08:44:01.0000] <Dashiva>
What about providing a santitation library in C or something

[08:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: That's understandable, since XML parsers don't produce XML

[08:44:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, by the way, there are no PHP libraries that are reliably available on shared hosts, unless they're written in pure PHP.

[08:44:04.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: HTML5 parsers don't produce HTML

[08:44:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
(in which case you can bundle them)

[08:44:06.0000] <smaug>
what are "HTML5 notifications" ?

[08:44:07.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: Even if you got that into PHP 5.3.3, it'd be years before I could rely upon that.

[08:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Indeed, and I've got no idea what relevance producing *ML has to the discussion :-)

[08:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
No in PHP, separately

[08:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
smaug, it seems like they're a Google invention that has nothing to do with any standards body, but I didn't look very hard.

[08:45:03.0000] <Dashiva>
So it could be used for python and perl and whatnot too

[08:45:04.0000] <Lachy>
are there CMSs written in C or C++?

[08:45:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Dashiva: As AryehGregor says you can't run arbitary C code from PHP

[08:45:06.0000] <smaug>
AryehGregor: yet they are selling notifications as "part of HTML5"

[08:45:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not on all shared hosts, anyway.

[08:45:08.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Are you meaning XML serializers rather than parsers, or something?

[08:45:09.0000] <gsnedders>
Heck, you can't even rely upon all default enabled extensions being enabled.

[08:45:10.0000] <gsnedders>
And there might be random functions disabled.

[08:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I <3 PHP.

[08:46:01.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: No I'm meaning parsers, as a first step in sanitizing user-generated content

[08:46:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
smaug, I think this falls under HTML5 as buzzword for "cool new technologies that push the boundaries of what the web platform can do", rather than HTML5 as a name for some boring old spec.

[08:46:03.0000] <jgraham>
(in the case when the output is XML)

[08:46:04.0000] <smaug>
well, usually whatever falls under HTML5 has been defined in some whatwg or w3c spec

[08:46:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
At least at some point, yeah.

[08:46:06.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham: Nobody expects users to enter XML (except annevk), so I don't see why you'd use an XML parser for that

[08:46:07.0000] <Dashiva>
Usually implies exceptions

[08:46:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
Kind of odd.

[08:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I assume the person who wrote it doesn't really know what HTML5 is.

[08:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
I guess PHP shared hosts don't let you upload and run binary executables?

[08:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Don't ascribe to ignorance what can more easily be ascribed to competent marketing personell

[08:48:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: Nope

[08:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Surely you could just find a buffer overflow bug in PHP and use that to run your C extension

[08:49:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, some PHP shared hosts let you run binary executables.

[08:49:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But to do that safely you have to have separate Unix users for each customer.

[08:49:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, probably, seeming most hosts run massively out of date versions of PHP…

[08:49:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which typically means you need to use CGI.

[08:50:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Which doesn't perform as well as mod_php or FastCGI.

[08:50:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: But normally only via shell_exec in my experience

[08:50:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, well, yeah.

[08:50:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Which is fun combined with safe mode

[08:50:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
But that works.

[08:50:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Not with safe mode enabled

[08:50:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
If they use safe mode, yes, you're screwed.

[08:50:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
But some hosts don't, like 1and1.com.

[08:50:08.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs to get around to moving stuff over to his VPS

[08:51:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Then I can run arbitary binaries :P

[08:51:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me is lucky in that his first foray into web hosting was an already-running dedicated server

[08:51:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me now has a dedicated 16-core machine with 16G of RAM and, soon, 1.6T of raw disk space to play around with however he wants

[08:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: So what's sqrt(pi)?

[08:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
To a million digits?

[08:52:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Bah, who needs decimal expansions?

[08:53:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's a perfectly good transcendental number, don't sully it with your base-10 nonsense.

[08:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: The same as 1/10^5*sum(exp(n^2/(10^10)),n=-infinity..infinity)

[08:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
apparently

[08:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
sum(exp(n^2/(10^10)),n=-infinity..infinity is infinite.

[08:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
gsnedders: √π

[08:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hmm, apparently it has another root, what's that? :P

[08:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Or, if we want more fun, what are all three cube roots?

[08:55:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
That's trivial.

[08:56:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Once you've got one, you just multiply by roots of unity.

[08:56:01.0000] <workmad3>
gsnedders: √π is the square root of π

[08:56:02.0000] <workmad3>
it's a multi-valued function

[08:56:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you take the principal nth root of x, the other nth roots are just that times e^(2k*i*pi/n), k = 1, ..., n -1.

[08:56:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
The principal square root function is not multi-valued.

[08:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Indeed.

[08:57:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That only becomes a real problem with complex numbers.

[08:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Where you don't have a continuous single-valued square root function, and there's no obvious candidate for the canonical one.

[08:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
Hmph, that's what I get for copying from a newsgroup posting

[08:57:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't remember e^(2k*i*pi/n), k = 1, ..., n -1 off the top of his head though

[08:57:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me guesses he must've known it once… like, a year ago.

[08:57:06.0000] <workmad3>
it rings bells

[08:57:07.0000] <Philip`>
It's meant to be 1/10^5*sum(exp(-n^2/(10^10)),n=-infinity..infinity)

[08:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, it looks familiar.

[08:58:01.0000] <workmad3>
haven't done anything serious along those lines since 1st year uni though... so almost 6 years ago now :(

[08:58:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
e^(2k*i*pi/n), k = 0, ..., n - 1 are the nth roots of unity (i.e., the nth roots of 1).

[08:58:03.0000] <Philip`>
Anyway, that equation gives you at least the first 42 billion decimal digits of sqrt(pi)

[08:59:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If you know any nth root of a number, the others will just be found by multiplying by nth roots of unity.

[08:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
though it's not equal to sqrt(pi)

[08:59:02.0000] <Philip`>
Easily good enough if you just want the first million, anyway

[09:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
(http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/personal/pborwein/PAPERS/P56.pdf)

[09:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh, dear, it's already past noon.

[09:01:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I have to head off to my PDEs class.

[09:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
PDEs?

[09:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Partial differential equations.

[09:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
Particularly difficult equations?

[09:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh

[09:04:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Those too.

[09:04:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
And after that, an introductory cryptography course.

[09:07:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Will a data url default to utf-8 if the charset isn't specified?  Is that defined anywhere?

[09:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: AFAIK what is defined is a mix of mapping IRIs to URIs and then just whatever the MIME type is

[09:08:01.0000] <gsnedders>
the mapping of IRI to URI will leave it in UTF-8, but given something like text/html it'll try to use charset=windows-1252

[09:08:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
So... no?

[09:08:03.0000] <gsnedders>
No.

[09:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Well, for application/xml it will

[09:09:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Any idea on text/html-sandboxed?

[09:09:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hasn't read the spec for that

[09:09:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
kk

[09:10:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow! http://www.romancortes.com/blog/pure-css-coke-can/

[09:11:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Any clue on whether data urls without a doctype will trigger quirks mode?  How can I quickly test this?

[09:11:01.0000] <Lachy>
TabAtkins, yes, they will trigger quirks mode

[09:11:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Thanks.

[09:11:03.0000] <gsnedders>
TabAtkins: Yes, check parsing of <p><table>

[09:11:04.0000] <Lachy>
but you can test it easily by loading data:text/html,<p>some-html-here

[09:12:00.0000] <Lachy>
and then typing javascript:alert(document.compatMode); in to your address bar

[09:12:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, cool.  Thanks.

[09:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Ah, I understand how the cokecan works now.  Crazy!

Real Coke cans don't violate the laws of perspective :-(

[09:28:00.0000] <jgraham>
Real beer cans do, if you drink enough first

[09:35:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Work>
real coke cans don't violate using 55 extra divs on a page

[09:38:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
He didn't use 55 extra divs.  He used 55 extra *<p>*s.

[09:38:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Which is, of course, the wrong choice.  It should have been <div>s.  ^_^

[09:38:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
But also, this is just a cool tech trick, that's all.

[10:36:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
I've been talking with some people in #javascript about forms' submit events. Right now, if a user wants to perform validation on a form before submission, or to prevent submission and handle the form asynchronously, the user has to scrape the form to get the value of each element, perform tests for disabled inputs, and special-case inputs like checkboxes to try to replicate the information that the UA has about the form. It's imposs

[10:36:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
get information about, say, which button was pressed to submit the form. I'd be much nicer if all that information were provided in the event.

[10:37:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Ack, wall of text. I'm mostly curious about where the right place is to introduce the idea: here, the WHATWG list, or some W3C list. I don't know the politics involved here.

[10:40:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
whatwg is fine, or the htmlwg list.  Subscribing to the whatwg list is substantially easier, though.

[10:41:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What information are you wanting, exactly?  The value of all the form elements, and relevant attributes such as disabled, plus the origin of the submit event?

[11:07:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
TabAtkins: Sorry, was afk. I want access to the data goes into creating the query string or post body, including the button that triggered submit, coordinates on image inputs, the works.

[11:07:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
The simplest implementation that gets us most of the way there would be an array of nodes that were involved in submission — only enabled inputs, only checked checkboxes, only the clicked button. That does not get us information like image coordinates, but it makes form scraping much more reliable: if I want the value of the to-be-submitted form, I just get the name and value of every element in the array.

[11:08:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
There are plenty of other ways this could be implemented. I like the idea of supplying an array of objects, each of which has a key property, a value property, and an node property, so it'd be possible to ignore the elements entirely (and minimize DOM access) and just look at the keys and values from the array.

[11:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, that's interesting.

[11:10:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And your use-case is validation, right?

[06:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa! WebKit nightlies can already animate an element to full screen

[06:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
when has that landed and has it been proposed to the CSS WG or any WG?

[06:44:02.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, how?

[06:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: I didn't go through view source yet

[06:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
demo?

[06:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: http://jilion.com/sublime/video

[06:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, that's just full window zooming, not full screen

[06:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: alt-click in a nightly for full screen

[06:46:02.0000] <Lachy>
I suspect it's done with CSS transitions or CSS animations

[06:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: see docs on the page

[06:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
I guess my webkit version is a few days too old.

[06:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
upgrading now, will see if that works

[06:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[06:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
I've long argued that we should drop that restriction in HTML5, and the bogus security note, about entering full screen

[06:51:02.0000] <Rik|work>
this demo uses webkit transitions

[06:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay. secret rdar bug

[06:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik|work: how is the transition specified?

[06:52:02.0000] <hsivonen>
also, what's the UI spoofing security story for this stuff?

[06:52:03.0000] <zcorpan>
<source title='http://d31j8lt3uybmqs.cloudfront.net/sublimevideo/dartmoor.mp4' type='video/mp4' /> - poor man's preload='none'?

[06:53:00.0000] <Rik|work>
with CSS transitions set in JS

[06:53:01.0000] <Lachy>
full screen doesn't work for me in the latest webkit on Mac

[06:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if there's a spec

[06:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oddly, it's only for HTMLMediaElement

[06:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
not for Element

[06:54:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but still, the overlaid custom controls are supported

[06:55:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, which platform are you using?

[06:55:01.0000] <Rik|work>
hsivonen: after running the full window version, I have -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform; set on the <video> style attribute

[06:56:00.0000] <Rik|work>
but I don't know how the alt+click triggers the full screen mode

[06:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: Snow Leopard

[06:57:01.0000] <Rik|work>
and the minified JS is not helping

[06:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik|work: seems to call webkitEnterFullScreen() on the video element

[07:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
WebKit sure has long changeset messages

[07:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, ok. It's not working for me on Leopard. I'll try Snow Leopard later. It works on Windows though

[07:00:02.0000] <Rik|work>
didn't know there is a function for that

[07:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. platform/mac-tiger/Skipped

[07:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does WebKit still support pre-Tiger Mac OS X?

[07:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/50893

[07:03:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=500

[07:03:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What kind of useless STS header is that?  500 seconds?

[07:03:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I leave the tab open for ten minutes and MITM starts working again?

[07:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It should be six months or something.  Then browsers could ship it in a fixed list and avoid the bootstrapping problem.

[07:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
what happens if an attacker spoofs DNS and sets a long STS time to live on a bogus cert?

[07:11:01.0000] <hsivonen>
will users then be locked out of the real service for a long time?

[07:11:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
He'd have to get a bogus cert first.

[07:11:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
In that case, you lose anyway.

[07:11:04.0000] <Rik|work>
hsivonen: webkitEnterFullScreen seems to be protected, I can't call it in the console, I think it's only available in an onclick event

[07:11:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
In theory, though, yeah, sure.

[07:12:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You can probably manage your STS settings somewhere, though.

[07:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: isn't the CA lock feature's whole point that getting a bogus cert is a real threat scenario

[07:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Rik|work, I should hope so!

[07:12:03.0000] <Rik|work>
yeah, document.querySelector('video').webkitEnterFullScreen(); doesn't work

[07:12:04.0000] <Rik|work>
but window.onclick = function () {document.querySelector('video').webkitEnterFullScreen()} works

[07:13:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, no, the whole point of STS is 1) attackers could intercept an HTTP request (e.g., from typing "paypal.com" into URL bar) before it gets promoted to HTTPS, 2) users can click through normal cert warnings, but not if STS is set.

[07:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Rik|work: yay for APIs that modify behavior depending on call stack

[07:13:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, well, popup windows already do that.

[07:13:03.0000] <Rik|work>
it throws Error: INVALID_STATE_ERR: DOM Exception 11 otherwise

[07:13:04.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: is the CA lock feature different from STS then?

[07:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: I'm pretty sure one of the strict SSL things that are emerging had a CA lock feature

[07:14:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I think that's being left out of the first draft.

[07:14:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2009Sep/att-0051/draft-hodges-strict-transport-sec-05.plain.html#strict-transport-security-http-response-header-field

[07:14:03.0000] <hsivonen>
oh ok

[07:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It would be even better, IMO, if you could lock it to your own organization's private key.  That way you could switch CAs if you wanted.

[07:15:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
But let's start with the basics, making SSL actually effectively prevent MITM.  :)

[07:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
my bank uses EV when I log in through their front door to do banking

[07:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but they don't use EV when a merchant redirects to them for payment

[07:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
FAIL

[07:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
EV isn't good for much anyway, as far as I can tell.

[07:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, it relies on what, someone actually clicking on some icon to show the certificate details?

[07:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: well, yeah, but if a bank is going to use EV at all, they should use it all the time and *especially* when the user enters through someone else's site

[07:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Paypal seems to get it

[07:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
banks not so much

[07:18:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but even Paypal uses autocomplete='off'

[07:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
which doesn't make sense

[07:18:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Paypal is an online-only operation, it's typical that those have much more tech savvy than a brick-and-mortar place that also happened to put up a website.

[07:18:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why doesn't it make sense?

[07:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
because my browser is better at telling if it is refilling a form on the real paypal.com than I am

[07:19:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The point is so that it doesn't save the password where someone can look it up by clicking Preferences -> Privacy -> Show Saved Passwords or whatever.

[07:19:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Although you're right that autofilling is a cue that you're on the right site.

[07:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I have a greasemonkey script that fixes that for me when I enter through paypal.com

[07:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It should probably autofill the username but not the password, does it do that?

[07:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
but for some reason, the script fails when I enter through the French front of Paypal

[07:20:03.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: no

[07:20:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Oh well.

[07:20:05.0000] <hsivonen>
they can't control my Webmail autofill

[07:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and email is the single point of failure anyway

[07:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
The entire concept of passwords is broken anyway.

[07:21:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so unless they want to send me a one-time pad, they shouldn't bother with the autofill=off nonsense

[07:21:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Failure of e-mail won't break PayPal, they require more than just an e-mail to do password resets.  I think.  My mother's account was recently disabled for some reason and I had to take a phone call to get it reset.

[07:21:04.0000] <hsivonen>
also, it's not good to make me carry the Paypal password on a piece of paper

[07:22:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Passwords are really stupid, we should be logging in using some kind of public-key infrastructure where the private key isn't actually exposed to a programmable computer at any point.

[07:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Like it's in a USB device that only provides an API to the computer to let it encode or decode things using the private key, but doesn't actually tell it what it is, so you need the physical device to use the key.

[07:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
That could replace all passwords and make it impossible to steal someone's login remotely, whether with phishing or anything else.

[07:23:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
But it would require a whole bunch of infrastructure.

[07:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
Everyone would lose their devices

[07:25:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also, it would make it too hard to share your login details with somebody else

[07:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Password on brain states.  You just have to wait for ubiquitous persocom implants, and mind emulation.

[07:26:01.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: hardware dongles FAIL for compatibility reasons

[07:26:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Implementation details, really.

[07:27:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, you can get around the "losing" part by entrusting a master copy to someone who won't lose it, like your bank vault.  And have some setup where you can reclaim your accounts even if you lose the device, just like you can reclaim accounts if you forget the password today.

[07:27:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, sharing login details is best accomplished by some form of explicit delegation, not just giving them your login.  But you could share private keys with someone too.

[07:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, what?

[07:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, once you have mind emulation, couldn't you use that to emulate the brain states?  :)

[07:28:02.0000] <Philip`>
If you e.g. are in a business and need to process some financial transaction before the end of the day but the only person who is able to authorise it is on holiday, it's far easier if you just ask them for their login name and password before they leave

[07:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, what's to prevent playback attacks?

[07:28:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Replay attacks, I mean.

[07:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Not without the consent of the mind-state, obviously.  And if you can do that, you can force the real person to give up whatever authent mechanism is used as well.

[07:29:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, you're making assumptions about how easy it would be to delegate here.

[07:29:02.0000] <Philip`>
and that's a situation where normal people can understand the security model and risks, so it's probably going to be better than some complex fancy delegation system that's theoretically much more secure

[07:29:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least mind-states know that they're just copies.

[07:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Meh, it would be a black box.  You train people to do it and they can do it.  The dongle is a magical device that lets them log in, don't let anyone else have it.  If they want to let someone else use their account, they can make a file to send to them by clicking through a friendly GUI.

[07:30:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's a lot less complicated than many other things people have to do every day.

[07:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Plus, normal people hate passwords and would welcome a bit of extra complexity if it meant they didn't have to use them.

[07:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
(geeks also hate passwords, of course)

[07:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: hardware dongles are OK if they show you a number and you write it into your device

[07:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: handware dongles that connect to your computing device are bad, because:

[07:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
1) people think they are more secure than the Windows malware signing stuff as you

[07:44:02.0000] <hsivonen>
2) they limit competetition between desktop OSs, because driver availability for Mac and Linux will suck

[07:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
3) they don't work with your portable device that doesn't have the right interface form factor

[07:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so smart cards and USB dongles are bad

[07:45:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
1) You mean like the things that cycle through new numbers every minute?  Do those actually work if you don't want the one receiving the number to be able to figure out what the next number is?  I always thought client and server were just running the same PRNG with the same seed, so it's basically a shared secret, which isn't as good as a public key.

[07:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Finland has wasted enormous amounts of tax payer money on a smart card system 

[07:46:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
2, 3) Just make it a USB standard, say, like mass storage devices.  Portable devices usually have one of the mini-USB things, don't they?

[07:46:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: RSA has number generators. I don't know what their properties are and if they require you to trust your identity broker

[07:46:03.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: cheap phones don't have USB host mode

[07:47:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, how long would the number have to be for real security?  RSA normally relies on public keys that are a few thousand bits . . .

[07:47:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, they could pretty easily.  I never said this wouldn't require infrastructure changes, that's the major problem with it.

[07:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, the enormously expensive smart card system in Finland is a massive FAIL

[07:47:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and what really works is one-time pads (on paper)

[07:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and banks that issue the pads working as identity broker back ends

[07:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me 's bank has a thing where you have to put your card and PIN number into a device, then enter a number from the web site and type the result back into the site

[07:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
so it's not a PRNG thing

[07:48:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and a government site acting as a broker that connects identity consumers with the banks so that you don't need n times m integration

[07:48:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, interesting.

[07:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
anyway, the value added by an RSA thingy compared to a paper OTP is likely low

[07:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
So basically a government-run openid server?

[07:49:02.0000] <Philip`>
(The card is the important component, the devices are all the same)

[07:49:03.0000] <hsivonen>
TabAtkins: not OpenID, but kinda

[07:49:04.0000] <hsivonen>
say you want to check your pension situation

[07:49:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, not the specific technology.  Just making an analogy.

[07:49:06.0000] <hsivonen>
so you go to the pension site

[07:49:07.0000] <hsivonen>
it redirects you to the identity broker

[07:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the identity broker supports the smart card stuff

[07:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but no one uses it

[07:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
so instead, you click the logo of your bank

[07:50:03.0000] <hsivonen>
get forwarded to your bank

[07:50:04.0000] <hsivonen>
give a number from your OTP to the bank

[07:50:05.0000] <hsivonen>
the bank redirects you to the broker 

[07:50:06.0000] <hsivonen>
and the broker redirects you to the pension site

[07:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and the pension site gets your personal ID number

[07:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
everyone has the ID number anyway

[07:51:02.0000] <hsivonen>
assigned at birth

[07:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or when becoming a resident if not born here

[07:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
works with any browser

[07:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
no hardware dongles

[07:53:02.0000] <hsivonen>
no barriers to launching new software or hardware browsing platforms

[07:53:03.0000] <hsivonen>
no South Korea situation

[07:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, the government has to recognize you as an identity backend.

[07:54:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
But that's it, I guess.  And backends can then use whatever stuff they want to id you.

[07:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
OTP?

[07:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
one-time pad

[07:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me thought it was usually "one-time password" in this context

[07:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
there's a whole pad of them

[07:59:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Wikipedia upholds my usage: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTP

[08:00:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting.

[08:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. except http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad seems to say the pad is a cipher

[08:00:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: so yeah, one-time password

[08:01:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Right, a one-time pad is definitely a cipher.

[08:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
One-time passwords would be awkward to type in all the time, though.  Fine for occasional use, but not for every time you log into your e-mail account.

[08:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Passwords are a lousy tradeoff between convenience and security, they're both inconvenient and insecure.

[08:04:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
To quote Dan K., "passwords are used because they scale well, one at a time."

[08:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: if you can't trust your computer with your passwords and have a USB crypto dongle, wouldn't you have to enter a pin into the dongle to allow crypto operations at specific times?

[08:05:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
There's almost zero effort required to "secure" an account with a password.

[08:05:02.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: that's how those FAILed smart cards worked

[08:05:03.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: otherwise, your untrusted computer can poke at the dongle and perform actions as you

[08:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: just like untrusted software that hijacks your passwords on your computer can do

[08:06:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
hsivonen, it can only impersonate you as long as the crypto thing is in the machine.  As opposed to forever.

[08:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
AryehGregor: so you'd plug and unplug it all the time?

[08:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[08:08:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
It's all very annoying, I guess.  There's no easy solution short of, let's say, unsurmountable biometrics plus hardware DRM, all dirt-cheap.

[08:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
(unbreakable hardware DRM, obviously)

[08:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
It'd be a boring world if there easy perfect solutions to problems

[08:10:01.0000] <Philip`>
Much better when it's all about tradeoffs

[08:15:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
The solution to the dongle problem would be a physical button on the device that you press to enable it for a single transaction.

[08:16:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
What if malware sends transaction requests at the same time as your bank?

[08:16:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
Hrm.

[08:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Mechanical buttons sound bad for cost and reliability

[08:17:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, you need buttons if you want the "type in the code" thing anyway.

[08:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
True

[08:19:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
Lemme butt in with a quick spec question... is anyone familiar with why forminput and formchange events don't bubble?

[08:19:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me used to use a computer where the only USB ports were on the back, with a large desk between him and the machine, so USB dongles would be pretty inconvenient

[08:19:02.0000] <Sidnicious>
(<http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#event-dispatch>)

[08:19:03.0000] <Philip`>
Clearly they should be wireless

[08:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sidnicious: Seems like not bubbling is the default behaviour

[08:20:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why should they bubble?

[08:20:02.0000] <Sidnicious>
Event delegation.

[08:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
Can't you do that with capturing instead?

[08:28:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
TBH I've been spoiled by using jQuery for all my event-related work in recent memory. It only supports binding to the bubbling phase, except in a couple of special cases.

[08:29:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
If capturing works just as well, I guess the libraries'll adapt.

[08:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, strange that jQuery wouldn't support event capture

[08:30:01.0000] <Dashiva>
IE compat, surely

[08:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
Does IE not have any equivalent to capture?

[08:32:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't believe so

[08:33:00.0000] <Philip`>
That might explain it then

[08:34:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
All right.

[11:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't have any facts to back me up, but it is my impression that the people who participate in the telcons are already quite well informed and active on the mailing list

[12:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: I recall noticing people at telecons who have rarely posted to the mailing list

[12:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
Do they contribute in other ways?

[12:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
(It's not so useful having people well informed if they don't do anything with their informedness)

[12:12:00.0000] <john_fallows>
is websocket-protocol of empty string supported by draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-68 ?

[12:13:00.0000] <john_fallows>
section 5.1 seems to indicate that server must send back empty string for /subprotocol/ when websocket-protocol header in client handshake is empty string (because it is non-null)

[12:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
how do you mean by "supported"?

[12:15:01.0000] <john_fallows>
i meant permitted by the specification

[12:15:02.0000] <john_fallows>
actually, as i'm trying to explain it, i found something relevant

[12:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
the API won't accept it

[12:16:01.0000] <john_fallows>
if there are any entries in the /headers/ list whose names are the empty string

[12:16:02.0000] <Hixie>
but if a (non-browser) client sends it, the server defines what should happen

[12:16:03.0000] <john_fallows>
this is for names, not values

[12:16:04.0000] <john_fallows>
yep, that's fine

[12:16:05.0000] <Hixie>
er, the protocol spec defines what should happen on the server, i mean

[12:17:00.0000] <john_fallows>
i think there might be a section further up that states the subprotocol value should be non-null and non-empty

[12:17:01.0000] <john_fallows>
yep, got it

[12:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i don't know what you mean by "permitted by the specification"

[12:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
which specification? there are two

[12:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
the API? the protocol?

[12:17:05.0000] <Hixie>
sent by the client? by the server?

[12:17:06.0000] <john_fallows>
sorry, i was discussing the wire protocol spec draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-68

[12:17:07.0000] <Hixie>
client->server? server->client?

[12:19:00.0000] <john_fallows>
the description of section 5.1 "Sending the server's handshake" /subprotocol/  says...

[12:19:01.0000] <john_fallows>
"Either null, or a string representing the subprotocol the server is ready to use."

[12:19:02.0000] <john_fallows>
...

[12:19:03.0000] <john_fallows>
"The empty string is not the same as the null value for these purposes."

[12:19:04.0000] <john_fallows>
i read that to mean empty string was permitted, but it is not, as described elsewhere in the document

[12:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
there's no concept of what is permitted from the server in the subprotocol name

[12:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
the server just sends back what the client sends

[12:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
if the client sent the empty string, then the server will send the empty string

[12:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
(assuming it wants to accept the connection)

[12:22:01.0000] <john_fallows>
understood

[12:23:00.0000] <john_fallows>
so the constraint of non-empty protocol name is for client only, as described by section 4.1 Handshake (in section 4 Client-side requirements)

[12:23:01.0000] <john_fallows>
"The /resource name/ and /protocol/ strings must be non-empty strings of ASCII characters in the range U+0020 to U+007E."

[12:23:02.0000] <john_fallows>
?

[12:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
right

[12:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
and the API also restricts it

[12:24:02.0000] <john_fallows>
ok, now it makes sense

[12:25:00.0000] <john_fallows>
the difference in strictness between client and server caused my temporary confusion :-)

[12:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
in practice there's no reason for a server to support the subprotocol "", since compliant clients can't send it

[12:26:01.0000] <john_fallows>
yes, agreed.

[12:27:00.0000] <john_fallows>
btw, i have some feedback regarding delivery of binary WebSocket frame payloads to JavaScript

[12:27:01.0000] <john_fallows>
should i send an email to the mailing list?

[12:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
yes please

[12:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
for binary i'm basically waiting for the text stuff to be widely implemented first though

[12:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
baby steps

[12:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
(also waiting for JS to have binary support)

[12:29:00.0000] <john_fallows>
i suspect that waiting for JS to have binary support is unnecessary and will explain the proposal in the email

[12:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think it's likely that JS binary support will come long before websocket is widely supported

[12:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it might be a moot point

[12:32:00.0000] <john_fallows>
that would be wonderful, will send the proposal and then we can discuss it

[12:33:00.0000] <john_fallows>
btw, I'll be at Google HQ later this afternoon, would like to stop by to say hi if you are around.

[12:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
===========================================

[12:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[12:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
dunno when i'll get in, but i'll be on IRC so we can coordinate here

[12:34:02.0000] <john_fallows>
sure, or if you email me your phone number, i can give you a call when my meeting is done

[12:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
don't have a phone

[12:40:00.0000] <john_fallows>
hope to see you later, bye for now.

[12:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
later

[13:37:00.0000] <john_r_fallows>
Hixie: sent the WebSocket binary frame proposal to the mailing list - http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-comments/2010Jan/0009.html

[17:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: yt?

[17:44:00.0000] <roc>
oh dear

[18:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh dear?

[18:13:00.0000] <boogyman>
hello ian

[18:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
hi

[18:55:00.0000] <roc>
/me was reading Larry Masinter's blog

[00:00:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
are there any good examples on how to use the schema versioning features in html5 databases?  The spec is kind of confusing me

[00:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: It's interesting to see the overspecification argument coming from an Adobe guy when Adobe's Flash bloggers extoll the virtues of having the predictability of a single codebase runtime

[00:23:00.0000] <roc>
clearly fostering competitive implementations isn't a goal there

[00:24:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
where are the arguments to openDatabase specified?

[00:26:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: I'm here

[00:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: http://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase/

[00:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: hey

[00:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: consider:

[00:27:03.0000] <Hixie>
   <div itemscope itemtype="http://example.com/a" itemref="x"></div>

[00:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
   <div itemscope itemtype="http://example.com/b" itemref="x"></div>

[00:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
   <div id="x"> <p itemprop="q" itemscope> <span itemprop="r">s</span> </p> </div>

[00:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
right now we generate four blank nodes in the RDF conversion

[00:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
seems like we'd want to generate three

[00:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
but what properties should the third one have?

[00:28:03.0000] <foolip>
let me try it

[00:30:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: is this about what to do with type in subproperties, or something else?

[00:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's how i came to notice the four/three issue, yeah

[00:33:00.0000] <foolip>
4 blank nodes: 2 for the items, and a duplicated one from the itemref'd item, yes?

[00:33:01.0000] <foolip>
you're thinking that we should merge these?

[00:33:02.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: Larry Masinter and others seem to have a fundamentally different view of the world than we do

[00:34:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me uses <fcaption> on a site

[00:34:01.0000] <roc>
can't we at least call it figcaption?

[00:34:02.0000] <tiglionabbit>
Hixie: thanks.  But what if you have more than one migration in there?

[00:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: how do you mean?

[00:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: yeah

[00:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: i intend to call it figcaption

[00:35:03.0000] <Hixie>
roc: the issue of the <details> legend element isn't resolved though

[00:35:04.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: since in the currently specced algorithm the itemprop="q" won't generate any triples (because it has no itemtype), it doesn't matter, but I guess you mean if we give an itemtype we shouldn't duplicate the data?

[00:35:05.0000] <roc>
cool

[00:36:00.0000] <roc>
hsivonen: I kinda wish I fully understood that view and why they hold it

[00:36:01.0000] <roc>
but I don't have the time

[00:36:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: assume that we'll generate triples for it (your argument is compelling, though i'm not sure i like using the type for it)

[00:36:03.0000] <tiglionabbit>
Hixie: do you just put in multiple calls to changeVersion in that callback there, and assume non-appliccable ones will not be run?

[00:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: you're, like, actually making me read the spec :-P

[00:37:01.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: OK, as long as you can get the data out, I'm quite fine with whatever monster predicate is used :)

[00:38:00.0000] <tiglionabbit>
Hixie: aren't you the editor?

[00:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: yup

[00:38:02.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: it would be quite easy to let the RDF converter hold a list of blank nodes and the DOM nodes they were generated for, to simply reuse them if the same node generated more triples later

[00:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: i edit hundreds of pages of spec, i don't know them all well :-)

[00:39:00.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: that would kind of break the current layering on top of the 

[00:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me switches to <figcaption>

[00:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: ok it looks like the expected way to do multiple version changes is just to chain the changes, so e.g.:

[00:39:03.0000] <foolip>
... "properties of an item" definition, but OK

[00:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: if you have 1->5, 2->5, 3->4, 4->5, you would changeVersion 1 to 5 with the error handler trying 2 to 5 with that error handler doing 3 to 4 and its success _and_ error handlers doing 4 to 5, and then have the succcess handlers for all of those except 3->4 and the error handler for 4->5 all be the smae "ok we're ready" handler

[00:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: yeah the RDF algorithm might need to be reworked to handle this

[00:41:01.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: do you have a specific idea for what predicates should be used for itemtypeless subitems?

[00:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: ...(using a cache or something)

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: so originally i figured i'd just stick the property name ('adr', etc) after the : and before a %20 before the property names, but then i realised there could be multiple property names (itemprop="a b")

[00:42:01.0000] <tiglionabbit>
Hixie: gosh that's complicated.  I thought this was going to be more like rails.  I suppose that's more flexible though, maybe

[00:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: and then i realised there could be multiple types too

[00:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: the whole database spec is basically on hold at this point anyway because mozilla and microsoft won't implement it

[00:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: so there is little interest in really fixing problems like that at this point

[00:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
tiglionabbit: i agree that the model is suboptimal

[00:43:03.0000] <hsivonen>
roc: the single runtime view or the view that overspecification is anticompetitive?

[00:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: so i don't know what to use

[00:44:01.0000] <roc>
the whole thing

[00:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
btw it's clear that _over_specification is anticompetitive

[00:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. if we specced the finer details of UI, or performance characteristics

[00:44:04.0000] <roc>
I disagree

[00:44:05.0000] <roc>
because vendors could simply ignore that

[00:44:06.0000] <tiglionabbit>
Hixie: I really want to write an application that manages a lot of client side data, and it would be disastrous to lose any of it.  What should I do, serialize it and shove it in local storage every time it changes?

[00:44:07.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: an item can only have one type (since you changed it)

[00:44:08.0000] <Hixie>
roc: well then it's not specified

[00:44:09.0000] <roc>
if it's not needed for interop, vendors can simply ignore the spec and no real harm is done

[00:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: yeah but an item can have multiple parents with different types

[00:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I think the DOM should have specced the big-O characteristics of firstChild and NodeList.item()

[00:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: wasting my time is "real harm" :-)

[00:45:03.0000] <roc>
ah

[00:45:04.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: oh, shouldn't that be invalid?

[00:45:05.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: the example i gave above is an example of that

[00:45:06.0000] <roc>
I don't think Larry was thinking of you here :-)

[00:45:07.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: ah, I see

[00:45:08.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: i suppose we could make it invalid but catching that case would be a huge pain

[00:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: worse even than loops

[00:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
still need to make those less strict btw

[00:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
havne't looked at that yet

[00:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
roc: i assume that "overspecification" is only an issue if the specification is going to be followed

[00:46:04.0000] <hsivonen>
(or, more to the point, the DOM should have promised O(1) for nextSibling)

[00:46:05.0000] <Hixie>
roc: obviously a work of fiction is irrelevant

[00:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: and so can't be harmful per se (well other than to the spec writer, but they're a minor concern)

[00:47:01.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: I've implemented a new "properties of an item" which basically throws away all properties which would lead to loops back to itself, and nothing else (the algorithm also detects other loops and ignores those though)

[00:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: did you mail that in?

[00:47:03.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: not yet

[00:47:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: speaking of overspecification, I'm currently assuming that the story of initial about:blank not firing onload isn't going to fly anyhow, so I'm working on making it fire

[00:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: please do

[00:47:06.0000] <foolip>
Hixie: I will, don't worry :)

[00:47:07.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: please send feedback on that so i'll remember to fix it :-)

[00:48:00.0000] <foolip>
now work (<video>)

[00:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: thanks

[00:55:00.0000] <webben>
roc: I think I agree with you and Hixie. Maybe it might be more persuasive to people like Larry to hear from some representatives of the smaller HTML consumers they seek to protect.

[00:56:00.0000] <roc>
that's a good idea

[00:56:01.0000] <webben>
a Netsurf developer maybe and/or a small HTML editor developer.

[00:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
webben: if you can find out where larry is coming from and explain it to me (or us, I believe roc and others are in the same boat here), that would be really helpful, IMHO

[00:56:03.0000] <roc>
I'd actually quite like to meet Larry and talk to him

[00:56:04.0000] <roc>
sometimes that helps

[00:56:05.0000] <Hixie>
direct communication with larry has so far failed to enlighten me, and not understanding his position is definitely a problem

[00:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
roc: i've tried several times, unfortunately

[00:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
er

[00:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
roc: i've tried several times, _to no effect_, unfortunately

[00:57:03.0000] <roc>
:-)

[00:57:04.0000] <webben>
Hixie: I find his argument hard to follow.

[00:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
that has often been the difficulty i have faced in understanding his positions

[00:58:01.0000] <roc>
I think one problem is that being a "small implementer" of the whole HTML5 spec is not really feasible

[00:58:02.0000] <webben>
Hixie: I was more thinking of getting some representatives of the "296 remaining implementations" to give their thoughts.

[00:58:03.0000] <roc>
and that's just the way the Web is

[00:59:00.0000] <roc>
unfortunately

[00:59:01.0000] <roc>
I don't think there ARE 296 other implementations of stuff like Web-compatible implementations of the <img> DOM

[00:59:02.0000] <roc>
and there never will be

[00:59:03.0000] <webben>
There are more than 4 though ;)

[01:00:00.0000] <roc>
it would be interesting to know how many there actually are

[01:00:01.0000] <roc>
that are actively maintained

[01:00:02.0000] <roc>
I guess 10

[01:01:00.0000] <webben>
I guess htmlunit, lobo are two beyond the big 4

[01:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
WebKit is killing the RIM browser, right?

[01:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is NetFront suited for browsing the Web these days?

[01:02:01.0000] <webben>
netsurf doesn't have js yet iirc so can't be used for that particular example

[01:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
IceBrowser looks EOLed

[01:03:00.0000] <webben>
You know ... if the devs can be tracked down for these /dead/ UAs, they might also have useful ideas about the costs of under-specification... ;)

[01:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
i love how the ietf ignored my feedback on the hybi charter, announced the hybi charter with no mention of the whatwg, didn't respond to my further feedback on the hybi charter, and is now e-mailing the whatwg list to direct people to the hybi list to discuss websockets

[01:03:02.0000] <hsivonen>
last I looked, the Nokia browser on S40 was mainly suited for downloading Opera Mini...

[01:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
i also like how their charter has websockets going to LC in March 2011

[01:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: what's there left to do anyway?

[01:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's a very good question

[01:04:02.0000] <roc>
stuff it up

[01:04:03.0000] <Hixie>
i do have some pending feedback, but nothing that'll take over a year

[01:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe a week, or two

[01:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
then a test suite of course

[01:05:02.0000] <ukai_>
Hixie: hi

[01:05:03.0000] <Hixie>
but that's not on their timetable at all

[01:05:04.0000] <Hixie>
ukai_: hey, i have websockets feedback scheduled for next week

[01:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
ukai_: re httpOnly, seems reasonable to send them

[01:06:01.0000] <ukai_>
Hixie: i see

[01:08:00.0000] <ukai_>
Hixie: thanks

[04:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
how is the readystatechange event supposed to work with documents in iframes?

[04:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
/me wonders if there's any given rationale for Java lacking unsigned types, apart from that one interview where Gosling thinks it's too complicated for programmers to understand

[04:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
If that's too complicated, good luck with Enterprise Java

[04:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I've googled and read all I found, but there's no rationale to see

[04:45:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, except "But it's not _impossible to do things without unsigned"

[04:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me notes that people don't seem to think that Apple's closed platforms not having Java applets is a big deal

[04:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess Java applets are almost dead already

[04:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me waves to people who haven't switched away from clueless banks that require Java to do banking

[04:47:01.0000] <Dashiva>
With WebGL coming, you won't need them to do opengl in the browser either

[04:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
At least Java gives you unsigned shorts

[04:47:03.0000] <Philip`>
though it confusingly calls them "char"

[04:47:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: bytes being signed is very annoying

[04:47:05.0000] <Dashiva>
They're not really unsigned shorts, since they print characters if you print them :P

[04:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Cast them to int before printing :-)

[04:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: does OpenGL in the browser via Java work reliably anywhere?

[04:48:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Then I might as well use & 0xFFFF

[04:48:03.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Reliably how? It requires a graphics card

[04:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't believe it's any less reliable than a regular java app doing it

[04:49:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: who uses OpenGL via Java applets? is Java to OpenGL glue something that requires a separate install (on top of the JVM)?

[04:49:02.0000] <Dashiva>
No, it's java libs all the way down to JNI

[04:49:03.0000] <Dashiva>
JOGL or LWJGL

[04:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Aion (the MMO) uses an LWJGL applet to render the characters on the profile pages

[04:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so the user needs to permit JNI?

[04:50:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes

[04:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
just like banking Java

[06:29:00.0000] <payman>
jamesl: i remember you deleted _a lot_ of test results from one of my previous spartan test runs, do you do that still? i have 2 new test runs running now.

[06:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
payman: Wrong window?

[06:29:02.0000] <payman>
jgraham: yes!

[08:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
ins-alt-s is a strange shortcut... I wouldn't consider ins a meta key at all.

[08:49:01.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, is that for a screen reader?

[08:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes, JAWS

[08:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose their aim is to avoid picking shortcut keys that would clash with other application keys. Or maybe it's just because they have so many shortcuts, and so few meta keys to work with

[08:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's true

[08:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
No indication for bold and italic is pretty surprising, though, especially when e.g. JAWS supports it just fine

[09:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Argh... "I'll blog separately about the "reverse engineering" myth."

[09:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm sure there are a few QA departments out there who would like a word with Larry about that

[09:30:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, where is that quote from?

[09:30:01.0000] <daedb>
Lachy: It's from http://masinter.blogspot.com/2010/01/over-specification-is-anti-competitive.html

[09:30:02.0000] <Dashiva>
http://masinter.blogspot.com/2010/01/over-specification-is-anti-competitive.html

[09:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
we're a myth!

[09:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders who's talking

[09:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
ooops

[09:41:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, that's part of being a cabal

[09:44:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
you don't deny you exist, you say, We're just simple people, we grow lemons, we make olive oil.

[09:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Has krijnh been really disconnecty lately?

[09:57:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The logs seem very sparse

[10:01:00.0000] <krijnh>
Yes

[10:01:01.0000] <krijnh>
Got a new modem and stuff

[10:01:02.0000] <krijnh>
Sorry about that :(

[10:01:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Just wondering

[10:01:04.0000] <krijnh>
I'm making it up by using <video> and Theora a lot lately :)

[10:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'm here to see it all, I only use the logs for seeing what people highlight

[10:03:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I have a hard time figure out what's interesting in some of that parts that people highlight

[10:04:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe we need a slashdot-type tag system

[10:04:01.0000] <krijnh>
Perhaps I should reveal which people highlight which lines

[10:04:02.0000] <Dashiva>
"Interesting", "Funny", etc

[10:04:03.0000] <Dashiva>
"Evil"

[10:04:04.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe a lot of people just click randomly on the page and don't notice that it's accidentally highlighting lines

[10:04:05.0000] <krijnh>
Maybe it should just be removed

[10:04:06.0000] <Dashiva>
I like it

[10:04:07.0000] <krijnh>
Could serve the logs a lot faster if I did :/

[10:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But you could hash the IP address or something to generate a unique color for each marker

[10:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
krijnh: You could always make the markers optional, so the default loads fast and without them :)

[10:08:00.0000] <krijnh>
Sure :)

[10:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
krijnh: noooo. please don't remove highlights

[10:14:00.0000] <krijnh>
I won't!

[10:15:00.0000] <Philip`>
You should make highlights a Premium Subscription feature

[10:15:01.0000] <krijnh>
Moneyz!

[10:16:00.0000] <krijnh>
If only money could buy me more time each day :(

[10:16:01.0000] <krijnh>
By the way, perhaps of interest to anybody in here: http://fronteers.nl/congres/2009/sessions/a-web-of-confusion

[10:33:00.0000] <JonathanNeal>
Good afternoon!

[10:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
good evening

[11:49:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is quite pleased to find out he doesn't exist

[13:05:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Wait, so Slashdot has a story on the FSF's condemnation of the iPad, but no actual story about the iPad's release?  That's pretty pathetic even for Slashdot.

[13:07:00.0000] <Steve^>
I can imagine a million cool uses for that thing, few of which work under the iphone's oppressive state. So maybe they have a point

[13:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
What would be the point in having a story that every single other news outlet in the entire world already has at least two stories on?

[13:07:02.0000] <Steve^>
its not exactly hard to find an article about the ipad on another site

[13:08:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/01/27/1849207/Apples-iPad-Out-In-the-Open

[13:08:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't that an article about the iPad's release?

[13:08:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmph.  Why did I miss that?

[13:08:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Because people love having their expectations fulfilled

[13:08:04.0000] <Dashiva>
:P

[13:08:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
. . . okay, I admit to being an idiot, I probably have Apple stories not displaying on the front page.

[13:09:00.0000] <jgraham>
Philip`: What is the point of having the FSF story that was inevitable?

[13:09:01.0000] <Steve^>
for dummies like me that don't think that far enough ahead

[13:09:02.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: To keep the choir's preach-quota satisfied?

[13:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: Judging by the number of comments it worked rather well

[13:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders if any of the comments are along the lines of "FSF condemns apple device. News at 11"

[13:11:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me concludes Slashdot is just broken, as usual.

[13:11:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me wonders what other stories he's mysteriously missing.

[13:11:02.0000] <Dashiva>
The "AryehGregor is our lab rat user of the month" story, perhaps

[13:12:00.0000] <jgraham>
AryehGregor: If you're getting your news primarilly from /. you are missing things like "truth"

[13:12:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Works with the classic index.  I'll just use that from now on.

[13:12:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
jgraham, well, no, but I glance over the comments on some of the interesting stories.

[13:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The problem with slashdot is that you have to wait a few days before the comments stabilize

[13:13:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Anyway, at least the iPad doesn't support Flash.

[13:13:02.0000] <Dashiva>
And by then it's old news, so you have to go way back in the archives

[13:14:00.0000] <Steve^>
"at least"?

[13:14:01.0000] <Steve^>
Purely so you can say it has failed?

[13:15:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What?

[13:16:00.0000] <Steve^>
you said at least

[13:16:01.0000] <Steve^>
as if you are happy it has passed some threshold

[13:17:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I mean, "Maybe it's an evil machine designed to take away users' freedom, but at least it will help contribute to the demise of Flash."

[13:17:01.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder if it has hardware support for h264

[13:17:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Because it had better support youtube

[13:18:00.0000] <Steve^>
AryehGregor, ah, that makes more sense :)

[13:18:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dashiva, it will be like the iPhone, you use the YouTube app for YouTube.

[13:18:02.0000] <Steve^>
Dashiva, it does support youtube

[13:18:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I assume, anyway.

[13:18:04.0000] <Steve^>
they are pushing HTML5, apparently

[13:18:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't the youtube app just h264?

[13:18:06.0000] <Steve^>
think so

[13:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
(With a secret entry point because it wasn't used elsewhere yet)

[13:21:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What do you mean?  H.264 is a codec, not an app.

[13:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That it just accessed the h264 streams from youtube

[13:34:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, yeah, so does the Flash player.

[13:35:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
AFAIK you just have to enter the right URL and you can get the raw H.264.

[13:35:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
There's a "YouTube with <video>" Chromium extension that did just that, in fact.

[13:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes, but now that youtube has <video>, and safari supports <video>, surely they can bypass the separate app

[13:48:00.0000] <Steve^>
I think they probably do

[13:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
is anne stil on vacation?

[15:07:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is there a way in CSS to force table cells to have the heights you want, like table-layout: fixed does for widths?

[15:08:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Also, any way to force something to be exactly one page tall, in print?


2010-01-29
[17:19:00.0000] <enigmus>
Any work on multitouch gesture support?

[17:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
What, like some kind of multitouch event?

[17:20:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
What would the API for that look like?

[17:20:02.0000] <enigmus>
AryehGregor: Yeah. Mozilla has a few, the iPhone browser has also some support.

[17:21:00.0000] <enigmus>
https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Mouse_gesture_events

[17:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Interesting.

[17:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Dunno.

[17:22:00.0000] <enigmus>
http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariJSRef/TouchEvent/TouchEvent.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001482-CH4-SW1

[17:22:01.0000] <enigmus>
AryehGregor: well, yeah. That's going to be pretty fundamental very soon, with devices like the iPad popping up everywhere, I'm sure.

[17:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Is HTML really supposed to add new input events for every new type of input device that comes along?

[17:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess so.

[17:23:02.0000] <enigmus>
I'm afraid there might be some problem with patents, though. Apple seems to claim ownership of a few of these, more or less.

[17:24:00.0000] <enigmus>
AryehGregor: I would think so. Otherwise, the goal of webapps taking over the world doesn't make a lot of sense if the only way of using newer devices is to write a native app.

[17:24:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, we have the W3C Patent Policy to handle the patents.

[17:25:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If they have any, they have to declare them when the feature gets to Working Draft, and say whether they'll license them royalty-free.

[17:26:00.0000] <enigmus>
Great. I'm not sure what is the situation: Android and Nokia n900 do not support things like "pinch" to zoom (even though the hardware is capable), but Windows 7 does.

[17:27:00.0000] <enigmus>
I've heard claims Apple says they feel they have a patent on that one. Would they license it to MS? Maybe.

[17:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
If it's in a Working Draft, they have to say so, yes or no.

[17:28:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Royalty-free for all implementations of the standard, or not.

[17:28:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
And if not, they could be kicked out of the Working Group, as I understand it, if the patent covers "essential claims" (although I might misremember).

[17:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
(this is all W3C stuff, not WHATWG)

[17:29:00.0000] <enigmus>
I see. I really hope there is going to be some work toward multitouch, then.

[17:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
You could propose it on the whatwg list.

[17:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
multitouch would be better addressed to the www-dom list

[17:31:02.0000] <enigmus>
AryehGregor: OK, I'll check the archives and suggest the topic.

[17:31:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, listen to Hixie.

[17:31:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Not me.  :)

[17:31:05.0000] <Hixie>
but first we need a spec for single-touch, and, like, mice. and keyboards, even.

[17:31:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
Heh.

[17:46:00.0000] <enigmus>
There was some discussion on the list: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2009AprJun/0134.html and Nokia, more recently http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2009OctDec/0041.html

[17:50:00.0000] <enigmus>
But not much since October.

[18:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hasn't it already been established that text/html-sandboxed is *not* mime-sniffed as text/html in legacy browsers?

[18:09:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't think it's been established as true under all circumstances beyond any doubt.

[18:09:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
I saw someone say that IE might pose a problem if the URL ends in .html or such.

[18:10:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Hmm, k.

[18:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
IE will potentially sniff even if the query part ends in .html

[18:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so tricky to defend against

[18:39:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Just don't have the file end in .html?

[18:39:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I mean, for the common case of serving comments, it'll be a .php or .aspx commonly.

[18:40:00.0000] <boblet>
Re: “A header element is intended to usually contain the section's heading (an h1–h6 element or an hgroup element), but this is not required”

[18:41:00.0000] <boblet>
“this is not required” seems to mean the header doesn’t have to contain a heading, but a section generally should have a heading, right?

[18:42:00.0000] <boblet>
is “this is not required” for multiple headings in one section & web app use where the section lacks a heading?

[18:42:01.0000] <boblet>
or are untitled sections not as ‘to be avoided’ as I thought?

[18:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: php is often set up to respond even if you tack on arbitrary stuff to the URL

[18:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
TabAtkins: and if your URL takes a query parameter, and IE looks at that, you can tack on .html via a query

[18:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
http://example.com/script.php?foo=bar.html

[18:54:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
That's the most ridiculous bullshit I've ever heard of, and I hate whoever did that with a fiery passion.

[18:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the IE team? or the PHP team?

[18:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't see how either could be any more of a hate target than they are already...

[18:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
IE team.

[18:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so up til now, you've been totally cool with the 90s / early 2000s IE team

[18:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but now that you have learned this one additional fact...

[18:59:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
No.  But I hate the specific person in charge of the decision to activate sniffing if the query params happen to end in ".html".

[18:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
It was a generalized hate before.  But now it's focused on that one person.

[19:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: what does a datalist element with no option children represent?

[19:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
or to put it another way, what's the use case for a datalist element with no option children?

[19:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>

followup on the previous one http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/unicode-nearing-50-of-web.html

豪華な邸宅

[19:47:00.0000] <karlcow>
MikeSmith: you are moving :p

[19:47:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[19:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I just switched my IRC client to XChat Aqua and was having some trouble figuring out how to set it to use UTF-8

[19:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Its UI is suboptimal

[19:49:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I tried Colloquy and really liked it but it has some weird problems with tircd

[19:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
karlcow: btw, there is this fat tomcat at the building next door to t45 at Keio

[19:50:01.0000] <karlcow>
オンボロ家屋

[19:50:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
the building where the Murai-sensei faculty have their labs

[19:50:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
WIDE project

[19:50:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
they call this tomcat 社長

[19:51:00.0000] <karlcow>
hehe

[19:51:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
until yesterday, all he had was a dinky cardboard box to sleep in

[19:51:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but apparantly today he has this big wooden doghouse

[19:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I'm not sure he likes it much

[19:52:01.0000] <karlcow>
a zero-yen house after the collapse of the economy ;)

[19:52:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[19:52:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
so far I think he has not gone into it

[19:52:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
dude pretty much sits around all day and barely even opens his eyes when you pet him

[19:53:00.0000] <karlcow>
maybe a dudette could help him move in a better place instead of his shabby shelter. who knows :)

[19:53:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
they had a sign attached to the cardboard box: Please consider Shacho's health

[19:54:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
implication of the sign is, don't feed him, because he's too fat already

[19:54:01.0000] <karlcow>
:D

[19:54:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but being that it's Japan, even signs instructing people not to fee fat tomcats have to be polite

[19:55:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, Naoko has some pictures

[19:56:00.0000] <karlcow>
I'll have to come by myself to see that

[19:57:00.0000] <karlcow>
I'm planning to come to Japan. No date defined yet. Probably in April. not sure

[20:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
karlcow: would be great to see you

[20:17:01.0000] <karlcow>
yep yep

[20:17:02.0000] <karlcow>

/me ponders how to solve the microdata-to-rdf problem

[21:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it isn't solved already?

[21:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: issues were brought up

[21:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
sadness

[21:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
specifically, how to convert the following:

[21:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
    <div itemscope itemtype="http://example.com/a" itemref="x"></div>

[21:29:02.0000] <Hixie>
    <div itemscope itemtype="http://example.com/b" itemref="x"></div>

[21:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
    <div id="x"> <p itemprop="q" itemscope> <span itemprop="r">s</span> </p> </div>

[21:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think I am clear enough on the semantics of Microdata to help

[21:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I imagine the problem is that the contents of div#x are being interpreted in two different ways?

[21:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[21:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
not a problem for microdata, but when converting to rdf it causes an issue

[21:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
because they need a URL for the properties

[22:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
any rdf people here? Is there any meaning to the concept of a triple being stated twice?

[22:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. if I write (in Turtle): <about:1> <about:2> <about:3> . <about:1> <about:2> <about:3> .

[22:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
is that any different than just saying it once?

[22:51:00.0000] <Lerc>
The spec mentions the canvas dropshadow is Gaussian blur with defined SD.  Does that mean compliant browsers shouldl be pixel identical? (not counting precision errors).

[22:52:00.0000] <Lerc>
images made of dropshadows  http://screamingduck.com/Lerc/jspic/

[22:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
not counting precisions errors, yes, more or less

[22:54:00.0000] <Lerc>
I'm not sure who's wrong then but those pics render differently in FF and Safari. 

[22:54:01.0000] <Lerc>
Hard to tell because I'm generating the images in flash and its blur might be different again. 

[22:55:00.0000] <Lerc>
They make a funky testcase though :-)

[22:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[22:58:00.0000] <Lerc>
Next up is attempting JS+Canvas only Video.

[23:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
foolip: if you're around, I'd be interested in your input on the edits to the microdata section

[23:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
that i just generated

[23:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
i can produce a diff before i check in if that would help

[23:33:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Where do people get this idea that HTML5 needs to make conforming everything that has ever been conforming?

[23:33:01.0000] <hsivonen>
HTML 2.0 doctypes aren't conforming per 3.2

[23:33:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and 2.0 and 3.2 doctypes aren't conforming per 4.0

[23:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: HTML4 Transitional documents aren't conforming HTML4 Strict, even

[23:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think people are starting with an assumption that IETF mime type registration updates can never make previous content of that MIME type noncomforming, combined with the fact that HTML5 obsoletes the old registration and does not explicitly mention the old versions

[23:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
to conclude that

[23:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(I do not know if there is really such an IETF rule or if it applies to the W3C's inline registrations)

[23:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
there's a whole section on older versions

[23:56:04.0000] <Hixie>
"History", in the introduction

[23:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
then it seems like the logic being applied is fallacious if it is along the lines I said

[23:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2854 explicitly says it's not compatible with HTML2, even

[23:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
and HTML3:

[23:58:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Wouldn't it be sufficient to say something along the lines of: "The text/html content type may be used to label documents that conform to previous levels of HTML."

[23:58:03.0000] <Hixie>
      Note that [HTML20] included an optional "level" parameter; in

[23:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
      practice, this parameter was never used and has been removed from

[23:58:05.0000] <Hixie>
      this specification.  [HTML30] also suggested a "version"

[23:58:06.0000] <Hixie>
      parameter; in practice, this parameter also was never used and has

[23:58:07.0000] <Hixie>
      been removed from this specification.

[23:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
s/previous levels/a previous level/

[23:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: maybe. would that mean you can't write a validator unless you implement every version?

[23:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think the spec already allows you to bail if the doctype is some older version's, no?

[23:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
or did i remove that

[00:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: at least the spec allows validators to go into a legacy checking mode

[00:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: even if the MIME registration permitted HTML 2.0, I have no intention to support HTML 2.0 validation

[00:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
holy crap, this is a must in 2854:

[00:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
      Implementors of text/html interpreters must be prepared to be

[00:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
      "bug-compatible" with popular browsers in order to work with many

[00:01:04.0000] <Hixie>
      HTML documents available the Internet.

[00:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
you know, i really can't see anything in 2854 that is any different than what html5 does, really

[00:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: how did an anti-competitive statement like that get into an RFC edited by L. Masinter?

[00:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i don't understand the problem at all

[00:02:03.0000] <Hixie>
hopefully bugs have been filed explaining what parts of 2854 i need to include to make things better

[00:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
assuming 2854 is ok

[00:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
which it presumably is

[00:03:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it would mean you couldn't write a validator for conformance to the text/html content type without implementing every version, but you could still write an HTML5 validator

[00:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. the full screen controls in http://jilion.com/sublime/video are different from the full window controls

[00:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
are the full screen controls Safari-native?

[00:14:00.0000] <boblet>
any webkit peeps here? tried on #webkit but no informative replies :)

[00:14:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Larry has a point about overspecification being anti-competitive - it's true if you are more worried about protecting the 0.01% implementation from the 2% implementation than the 2% implementation from the 60% implementation

[00:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I can see the point, but it seems to me that in practice, having undocumented but de facto necessary behaviors is more anti-competitive

[00:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
overspecifying the unnecessary could be anti-competitive

[00:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but the thing is that whenever top 4 or even top 3 UAs have converged on a behavior, someone somewhere starts relying on it

[00:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: actually, roc made a good point about that

[00:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: which is that over-specification is harmless in practice

[00:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: since if it's not required to compete, you can just ignore it

[00:18:04.0000] <othermaciej>
of course, US antitrust law (and probably European too) would be more worried about a 60% vs 2% situation than a 2% vs 0.01% situation

[00:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: and if it is, it helps the underdog

[00:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so in fact, it's better to overspecify

[00:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: sometimes, it's really hard to tell which parts of HTML5 are known to be required to compete and which parts aren't

[00:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: my underlying model is that the far underdog (as opposed to the still-significant underdog) does not have the resources to independently determine what parts of the spec are required

[00:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: so one could argue you waste resources by implementing parts that aren't competitive requirements

[00:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
nor the resources to just implement the whole spec

[00:20:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and developing the knowledge of which parts are hard and which soft requirements for competitiveness partially comes back to the reverse engineering problem

[00:20:03.0000] <Hixie>
i view the spec as being like a high resolution image

[00:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
and an implementation as being like an approximation of that image

[00:21:01.0000] <hsivonen>
although it's still better than just reverse engineering, because the spec gives you a hypothesis

[00:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
now there are two ways to do this:

[00:21:03.0000] <Hixie>
fill in each pixel one by one, or fill in the broad brush strokes and slowly improve each bit

[00:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
if you do the former, then (a) you'll never be done and (b) over-specifying is a bad idea

[00:21:05.0000] <Hixie>
if you do the other one, then you'll ship soon, and you'll immediately get feedback about which parts to try to paint in more detail

[00:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think Larry's incorrect premise is that the level of benefit to #300 vs #4 is as important as the level of benefit to #4 vs #1

[00:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
and over time you approximate the spec in more and more detail

[00:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
so i stand by roc's premise

[00:22:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that's not how we tend to evaluate whether a market is competitive, at least in law, economics or common-sense understanding

[00:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: indeed, we'd be lucky (in terms of preserving freedom and choice) to have even a 5th major impl.

[00:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
well, we have a 4-and-a-halfth at least

[00:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
the and a half part fools people into thinking there are actually 5

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so that stuff that is WebKit only, gets promoted as Safari, Chrome and Chrome Frame and counted as 3

[00:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/,//

[00:24:02.0000] <othermaciej>
-and-a-half probably overestimates the degree of difference actually

[00:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think citing Safari, Chrome and Chrome Frame is only relevant in terms of telling content authors the size of their potential deployment target; definitely is not 3 separate implementations for standards purposes

[00:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(nor do Safari on iPhone, Safari on iPad, Arora, Epiphany, OmniWeb, iCab, Sunrise Browser, etc all count as additional implementations)

[00:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, even the w3c wasn't this arrogant when we discussed the w3c and the whatwg working together on html5

[00:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
the ietf people are making me have renewed respect for the w3c

[00:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
how dare they!

[00:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
If IETF doesn't offer patent protection, what's the upside of taking the Web Socket protocol to the IETF?

[00:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
none as far as i can tell

[00:34:02.0000] <hsivonen>
does the W3C require the protocol to be an IETF spec in order to get the PP on the API?

[00:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
(in theory more review)

[00:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
the W3C does not require the protocol to be an IETF spec at all

[00:35:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's only not in the W3C spec because the IETF whined to the W3C than the W3C were overstepping their agreement on who would work on what

[00:35:03.0000] <othermaciej>
IETF requires patent disclosure at least (IIRC)

[00:35:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: as far as i can tell it requires patent disclosure of patents that the contributors know about

[00:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and minimum RAND licensing, though a group can ask for RF commitments

[00:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
and i certainly don't know jack about google's patents

[00:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't remember the details that clearly

[00:36:03.0000] <hsivonen>
what's the IETF definition of RAND?

[00:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's somewhere in the process RFC

[00:37:01.0000] <hsivonen>
interesting. seeing green on dev.w3.org: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebTiming/

[00:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: "RAND" is not free-software compatible, so the definition is moot

[00:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I know RAND is neither reasonable nor non-discriminatory. I was curious, though.

[00:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
the relevant RFCs are linked to from every RFC's boilerplate

[00:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
well. I say "linked to". But of course the IETF is stuck using text/plain, so I really mean "mentioned".

[00:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
The problem with RAND is that what is considered reasonable is left entirely up to the patent holder, and the definition of non-discriminitory is that the fee applies equally to everyone, despite discriminating against those who can't be expected to afford the "reasonable" fee

[00:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
the fee isn't the problem, when it comes to free software

[00:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
but yeah

[00:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I would make fun of them for using plaintext, but I do all my editing in emacs

[00:42:03.0000] <othermaciej>
which I think folks on my team find equally laughable

[00:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: me too, but i edit _html_ :-P

[00:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me longs for the day when C++ can be edited the way Java is edited in Eclipse JDT

[00:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
does java not have macros?

[00:44:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it doesn't

[00:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'd have thought that was the biggest problem with making "real" c++ IDEs

[00:44:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it is

[00:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
k

[00:44:05.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: templates, too

[00:44:06.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and typedefs

[00:44:07.0000] <Hixie>
i thought java had both of those now

[00:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: with Java, the semantic role of any piece of syntax is decidable from a sane grammar

[00:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
without having to process any include files

[00:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Java has generics, which offer the benefits of casual templates

[00:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
right

[00:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
but generics don't support all the crazy computation in the compile phase stuff

[00:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay. my C++ compile phase completed. now I can edit.

[00:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to make a C++ IDE you have to parse all the C++ you are working with, but I don't think macros are a significantly larger part of the challenge than anything else

[00:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i would have thought that for an IDE's purposes, it'd be an issue because you'd have to keep track of what came from what

[00:48:02.0000] <hsivonen>
incremental Java compiles as you edit are also awesome compared to waiting for a Firefox build

[00:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i.e. it's not like you can just quickly reparse the current bit and say "oh yeah, that's an identifier"

[00:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the hard parts are aspects of the grammar that are ambiguous unless you know which identifiers are types, or the like

[00:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: you have to keep track of everything and how it corresponded to macros and so on

[00:49:03.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: that part of C++ language design is insane

[00:50:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: the preprocessor processing model is way simpler than parsing actual C++ itself

[00:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: fair enough

[00:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I have been using C++ professionally for something like 12 years now and I'm still occasionally learning things that totally surprise me

[00:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you were right that making streamless about:blank fire onload is a pain

[00:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[00:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
all this onload firing machinery wants to see a stream-bound request

[00:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
the problem in the spec would be making sure it doesn't fire twice

[00:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
not really sure how to do that

[00:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
since when you create the about:blank, you don't know that you're _not_ going to load a page

[00:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
and when you don't load a page, well, you didn't load a page. There's nothing to hook onto to fire the load.

[00:56:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I put the about:blank creation on the code path that with any other URL kicks off the first actual load

[00:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and if the browser context hasn't had anything loaded to it and is about to load about:blank, I generate a document and return early

[00:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i wish i could do that too, but the spec ended up too far from that to really do it sanely without a lot of tweaking

[00:57:02.0000] <hsivonen>
invoking the machinery for DOMContentLoaded is done

[00:57:03.0000] <hsivonen>
but when I try to fake onload, I keep hitting assertions that want to see a network request

[00:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so I guess I'll end up faking one

[01:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
or maybe I'll make the loading machinery have a flag that tells it it's actually loading a fake about:blank

[01:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
special cases...

[01:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: can XBL2 do evil things and inject scripts into about:blank synchronously with element creation?

[01:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
assuming you inject enough stuff into the document that it has bindings at all, i guess so

[01:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
about:blank isn't special in that sense

[01:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: can you inject bindings into about:blank somehow?

[01:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
sure, just inject a <link> to a style sheet or something

[01:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
or loadBindingsDocument()

[01:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
er, loadBindingDocument() even

[01:07:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: How do you inject the <link> before the sync about:blank has already been created?

[01:07:03.0000] <Hixie>
actually i guess a style sheet won't do it, that's always async

[01:07:04.0000] <Hixie>
wait, _before_ about:blank is created?

[01:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
about:blank is created as soon as you create the browsing context

[01:08:01.0000] <Hixie>
nothing can premept that

[01:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
preempt

[01:08:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in any case, having scripts run synchronously with element insertion to the DOM seems like huge badness

[01:08:04.0000] <Hixie>
/me points to mutation events

[01:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: what's the sync/async story for bindings that haven't loaded by the time a bound element goes live?

[01:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
(btw, you can bind elements that aren't even in the document)

[01:09:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: mutation events don't fire for parser-inserted stuff

[01:09:03.0000] <Hixie>
so, just for the record, i'm literally answering by reading teh spec here

[01:09:04.0000] <Hixie>
wait, parser-created?

[01:09:05.0000] <Hixie>
i thought we were talking about about:blank

[01:09:06.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused

[01:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: isn't the fake about:blank conceptually parser-created as far as mutition event craziness goes?

[01:10:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should read the whole XBL2 spec one of these days

[01:10:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I saw some scary code pertaining to XBL1

[01:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: it's just created, there's no parser

[01:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i don't see how mutation events would be relevant here

[01:11:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: there's no way to see the about:blank doc before it's completely ready

[01:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can't load binding documents before about:Blank is done

[01:12:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
what's the CSS selector syntax for saying, "element of class foo NOT followed by adjacent sibling of class bar"?

[01:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: .foo:not(:matches(#~.bar)) if my proposal goes through, but it's not possible currently

[01:13:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie: so there is no way to express it currently?

[01:13:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
oh

[01:13:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
you just said that

[01:13:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
sorry

[01:13:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
well shit

[01:13:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
that sucks

[01:13:06.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xbl/xbl2.html#binding is the key part

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the few paragraphs up to the first example in that section

[01:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: it'd be a perf nightmare

[01:14:02.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
MikeSmith: you'd need one rule to match all .foo and then another overriding .foo + .bar

[01:14:03.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
at the moment

[01:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
GarethAdams|Home: nah he wants to style the .foo, not the .bar

[01:15:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
of course, and my idea was broken in any case

[01:15:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: "If the binding document has yet to be (fully) loaded when it becomes known that the binding applies, then the user agent must wait until all running scripts have completed before attaching the binding." looks like a huge can of worms to me

[01:15:02.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
it's too early

[01:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: oops. never mind

[01:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: that's just saying (in terms that predate the html5's event loop spec) to queue a task instead of preempting a script

[01:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: to keep things predictable

[01:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: am I reading this correctly that binding loads race with script loads?

[01:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[01:18:01.0000] <hsivonen>
fun

[01:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
i was young, what can i say

[01:18:03.0000] <hsivonen>
but not making it so would be painful, I guess

[01:18:04.0000] <Hixie>
not sure how else to do it, yeah

[01:18:05.0000] <othermaciej>
xbl2 is still young too

[01:18:06.0000] <Hixie>
short of doing what we do with css

[01:18:07.0000] <othermaciej>
at least in implementation years

[01:18:08.0000] <Hixie>
which is painful too

[01:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yeah sometime this year i'll take the feedback collected and do another CR

[01:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess blocking the parser on inline scripts if there are pending bindings would be doable

[01:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: (sometime after sicking sends some more feedback)

[01:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
also, it looks like a sane XBL2 impl. is going to continue to need the Gecko scriptrunner facility

[01:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I hope we get a chance to start on it soon but we only have bandwidth for so many architecture-level changes at a time

[01:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
(i have 52 e-mails in the XBL folder)

[01:20:03.0000] <hsivonen>
so I guess we aren't getting rid of that

[01:20:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yeah, it's just not as high priority as a lot of the other new stuff

[01:20:05.0000] <othermaciej>
after our current semi-stealth one the next big change will probably be one of HTML5 parsing, XBL2, or refactoring the render tree

[01:20:06.0000] <Hixie>
i vote for parsing

[01:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if other engines have a facility to queue tasks that go into a local task queue that is executed at a safe point between now and the next event loops spin

[01:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but more than any of those things I want to see implementation of more HTML5 elements and form controls

[01:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd love to see new form controls in Gecko *and* a story for styling them

[01:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: you mean like the spec's "synchronous section"?

[01:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: XBL2 spec's?

[01:22:03.0000] <hsivonen>
oh HTML5's

[01:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, html5

[01:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it says: "A synchronous section never mutates the DOM, runs any script, or has any other side-effects."

[01:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
so no

[01:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the whole point of scriptrunners is that they can do that kind of scary stuff

[01:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
man, i fixed both session history's async hairball and the microdata sub-vocab-in-rdf issue today. i'm on a roll.

[01:24:02.0000] <Hixie>
i hope this is indicative of a renewed level of productivity

[01:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: right now those are used to do async stuff that needs to inspect the DOM without being racy against running scripts

[01:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: basically it's a synchronisation section for other threads

[01:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
at some point i might have to add (e.g. for xbl) a new thing about the same place, like a high-priority queue or something

[01:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
so far i've avoided it

[01:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, w3c microdata editorial stuff, let's see

[01:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the idea of scriptrunners is that they look synchronous from the POV of scripts but are deferred from the POV of C++

[01:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: any suggestions for how i should describe microdata and 2dcontext in terms of "context and rationale"?

[01:30:01.0000] <Hixie>
(it's one of the things i have to put in the status-of-this-document section)

[01:31:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: can you give an example of text along those lines in another document's sotd for a point of reference?

[01:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not very familiar with the sotd requirements

[01:31:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's the paragraph starting "This specification is a module that forms part of the HTML5 series" in the microdata spec currently

[01:33:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm checking what Web Storage says in the equivalent place

[01:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't see any text analogous to that in Web Storage, it goes straight from the responsible Working Group paragraph to the patent policy paragraph

[01:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
uh, yes indeedy, i appear to have omitted the context section in that spec

[01:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Workers says "This specification is intended to specify a part of the Web platform closely related to HTML5. It is defined in a separate document primarily to ease the cognitive load on reviewers."

[01:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
WebSocket says "This specification is being developed in conjunction with an Internet Draft for a wire protocol, the Web Socket Protocol, available from the IETF at the following location"

[01:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can use the web worker text if you like

[01:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I would say something like "This specification was developed in tandem with HTML5 and is intended to be used in conjunction with it"

[01:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
or something like the Workers spec, though maybe people would get irked at "closely related"

[01:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
that works

[01:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the sentence I suggested seems more fact-based and so hopefully less controversial

[01:37:03.0000] <Hixie>
tis in

[01:37:04.0000] <Hixie>
though if you can predict what's going to be controversial, you're a better man than i

[01:38:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sometimes I am able to guess

[01:38:01.0000] <othermaciej>
certainly not always

[01:38:02.0000] <othermaciej>
signing off for a bit to debug something, will be back

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
figcaption, etc., pale in comparison when you consider that the token for denoting a person's name is called fn

[01:46:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me always assumes fn means "file name"

[01:46:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I assume it means "function"

[01:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
fullname

[01:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or that it's a symbol for the n-th fibonacci number

[01:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or an abbreviation of fnord

[01:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
an abbreviation of what?

[01:48:02.0000] <othermaciej>
your sentence got cut off it looks like

[01:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so... is it ok to refer to the HTML5 spec at all? Or...?

[01:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm confused about how to handle all the cross-references

[01:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
like the references to "boolean attributes", or "HTML element", or "applicable specification"

[01:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it is ok to normatively reference the HTML5 spec

[01:57:04.0000] <Hixie>
k

[01:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
not ok to claim to be part of it

[01:58:01.0000] <othermaciej>
you can look at HTML+RDFa as an example of ways in which it is apparently uncontroversial to reference HTML5

[01:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
its context paragraph is "This specification is an extension to the HTML5 language. All normative content in the HTML5 specification, unless specifically overridden by this specification, is intended to be the basis for this specification."

[01:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
k

[01:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
should i just use that?

[01:59:03.0000] <othermaciej>
that is actually a well-worded paragraph IMO

[02:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
k

[02:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: how much of http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#conformance-requirements (section 2.2 and its two subsections) should i have in the microdata spec? or should i just reference that too?

[02:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm referencing most of the rest of the 2.x sections

[02:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: my own judgment would be that Microdata should probably have most or all the bits besides the definitions of conformance classes, but could just cite the conformance class definitions

[02:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
at the very least I think it would be good to cite RFC2119 directly instead of via an indirect reference

[02:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[02:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
let's see if i can do that without duplicating the text

[02:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
this ought to be fun

[02:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if the document loading machinery really needs to be this complex

[02:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
this stuff dates back all the way to 1998

[02:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: then the answer is almost certainly "no"

[02:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
um

[02:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
opera got k-lined?

[02:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's... mysterious

[02:43:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me is still here

[02:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
you're not going through the office nat

[02:44:00.0000] <jgraham>
True :)

[02:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have a new feature request for gsnedders

[02:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
sanitising the <hx> to fit the outline

[02:46:02.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders what Hixie means by "sanitizing"

[02:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
turning <h2>...</h2> <h5>...</h5> into <h2> and <h3> respectively

[02:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
or just out-and-out supporting <section>

[02:47:02.0000] <Hixie>
and outputting appropriately numbered <hx>s

[03:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: There already is such a thing, written for lac

[03:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah

[03:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(with section, that is)

[03:11:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Dunno how brilliant it is

[03:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
then i guess my suggestion is to jgraham to enable it?

[03:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: You just need to send whatever option to PMS

[03:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[03:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
guess i should look into that

[03:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[03:14:00.0000] <gsnedders>

Hixie: I'll have a look at the recent microdata edits over the weekend

[03:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
;cool

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I signed up to give a lecture about HTML5 again

[04:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder what adjustments I should make to last year's lecture except mentioning Microdata

[04:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
And mentioning that instead of spec vs. buzzword there's now a class of things that used to be in the spec but have been split out

[04:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
hsivonen: Examples of progress in implementation?

[04:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: yeah, I should update my screenshots to show Firefox instead of Minefield, etc.

[04:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You could mention the @autobuffer case as an example of how people can get involved and effect change and improvement :)

[04:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: well, it's not a great example, because gruber didn't bother emailing the WG.

[04:17:00.0000] <foolip>
also, nothing has actually happened spec-wise with it yet (unfortunately)

[04:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
gruber said he would send in his feedback

[04:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me mails him to ask him when

[04:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i should do some video feedback sooner rather than later

[04:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it's a good example of how the people writing the specs take account of feedback for authors, even if it's a bad example of how authors should give feedback to the people writing the specs

[04:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
also, it's not clear yet if the change effected (if effected) is an improvement :-)

[04:19:02.0000] <Philip`>
s/for/from/

[04:19:03.0000] <danbri>
you could mention changes in the browser landscape (faster .js etc...)?

[04:19:04.0000] <foolip>
yes please :) we are holding off supporting autobuffer (or anything like it) until that issue is resolved

[04:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok it's on my list to do after the websocket feedback

[04:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is my plan for next week

[04:20:02.0000] <foolip>
ok, no panic on this end, sounds good

[04:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
right, i should go sleep

[04:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[06:41:00.0000] <annevk>
ah yes, fetching >4000 emails

[06:41:01.0000] <annevk>
joy

[06:41:02.0000] <jgraham>
Welcome home :)

[06:42:00.0000] <jgraham>
I recommend ignoring all the emails, most of them are boring and anything important enough to worry about will probably get resent anyway

[06:46:00.0000] <annevk>
sounds like a plan

[06:46:01.0000] <annevk>
about 350 are spam apparently

[06:48:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
How long were you gone, Anne?

[06:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
350 sounds like a low spam count to me.

[06:48:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Or high, if they actually made it to your inbox.

[06:49:00.0000] <annevk>
about three weeks

[06:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"Since previously, HTML content that invoked quirks mode *was* conforming, we can't make it non-conforming."

[06:52:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Can't we?

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Of course not, because that's not allowed

[06:54:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not allowed by... the axiomatic proof?

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
If it was allowed, then we could make old content non-conforming, which we can't do because it's not allowed

[06:55:01.0000] <Philip`>
therefore we can't allow it

[06:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
Proof by contradiction

[06:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
If it's not proof by axiom, it isn't valid

[06:57:01.0000] <annevk>
I think that statement follows from the imo misguided way media types are drafted to work

[06:58:00.0000] <annevk>
btw, I noticed data URLs were discussed at some point here

[06:58:01.0000] <annevk>
they do have fragment identifiers

[06:58:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Only in Opera, apparently

[06:58:03.0000] <annevk>
fragment identifiers depend on the media type, not URI scheme

[06:58:04.0000] <annevk>
well, Firefox is buggy

[06:58:05.0000] <jgraham>
And webkit

[06:58:06.0000] <annevk>
also buggy

[06:58:07.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe it's actually a (sensible) desire to guarantee backward compatibility within media types, but twisted by a (incorrect) notion that content conformance and interoperable operation are tied together

[06:59:00.0000] <annevk>
see RFC 3986

[06:59:01.0000] <Lachy_>
Dashiva, people who claim things like that need to realise that a new specification making things non-conformng with respect to that particular specification, doesn't make those things non-conforming with respect to other specifications.

[06:59:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: I think the complaint is partially that changing the registration would make all text/html be considered HTML5

[07:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
So you wouldn't be able to serve HTML<5 at all

[07:01:00.0000] <Lachy_>
that's nonsense. You can serve it. It's just non-conforming HTML5. But it may still be conforming with the older specifications, despite those older specifications being obsolete

[07:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can only serve it as text/html, and it's non-conforming text/html

[07:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
(since the new registration information for text/html would supercede the old ones)

[07:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
/me wonders where all the people fretting about whether their HTML2 is valid to send as text/html are

[07:03:01.0000] <jgraham>
Actually I know where they are, they are all on public-html

[07:09:00.0000] <Dashiva>
jgraham: I think they mostly live over at IETF

[07:10:00.0000] <jgraham>
Hmm maybe

[07:10:01.0000] <jgraham>
There seem to be a number on public-html as well though

[07:11:00.0000] <jgraham>
A number that I can count on my fingers admittedly 

[07:11:01.0000] <Dashiva>
They are possibly just fighting on behalf of others, not themselves

[07:13:00.0000] <jgraham>
Who are these others?

[07:13:01.0000] <Lachy_>
the others don't like to reveal themselves. They're a secret organisation.

[07:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
But they are many

[07:15:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy_: It wouldn't be conforming with the older specifications because the text/html registration would only allow HTML 5.

[07:16:00.0000] <Lachy_>
the text/html registration is irrelevant to the question of whether or not somthing conforms with an older edition of HTML

[07:17:00.0000] <jgraham>
Anyway the point is this is an issue so far removed from anything that real people care about that it isn't even worth the effort of discussing

[07:17:01.0000] <Dashiva>
You said "real people"

[07:17:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: It's a relevant question to whether the content of the resource representation of http://example.com/ which has a content-type of text/html is a valid response.

[07:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: As if the text/html registration says it must be HTML 5 and it is HTML 3.2 then the response is invalid

[07:18:01.0000] <Dashiva>
example.com uses utf-8, it's obviously fake

[07:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, yes. The response may be invalid per the text/html registration. But the file is still conforming HTML 3.2 (if the DOCTYPE was optional in that spec, which I think it was)

[07:20:00.0000] <gsnedders>
the _file_ is, but not the response.

[07:20:01.0000] <gsnedders>
And this is a concern about the validity of the response, not about the file itself.

[07:20:02.0000] <Lachy>
but regardless of that, what's the problem with the response being non-conforming now?

[07:20:03.0000] <jgraham>
People, you are still discussing this

[07:20:04.0000] <Lachy>
jgraham, sorry

[07:20:05.0000] <Lachy>
do you have an alternative topic?

[07:20:06.0000] <Philip`>
It's fun and relaxing to discuss things that don't actually matter

[07:21:00.0000] <jgraham>
There must be more fun things that don't actually matter

[07:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
because you don't have to worry about being correct or about the consequences of your statements and decisions

[07:21:02.0000] <Philip`>
What could be more fun than spec pedantry?

[07:21:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Charter pedantry, obviously

[07:21:04.0000] <jgraham>
And also you risk giving people the impression that things do actually matter

[07:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
Like the people who get worked up about Star Wars pedantry, or whatever

[07:22:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: Harry Potter pedantry?

[07:22:02.0000] <gsnedders>
I've never known you to pedant that.

[07:22:03.0000] <jgraham>
I'm not a Harry Potter pedant, just a fanboi

[07:22:04.0000] <Philip`>
Like how the Death Star explosion is scientifically proven to have wiped out all the ewoks?

[07:23:00.0000] <jgraham>
Yes

[07:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
That's not pedantry, that's genocide

[07:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What about pedantry about whether something constitutes pedantry or not?

[07:26:00.0000] <jgraham>
That's meta-pedantry

[07:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
Which isw quite longwinded to say and should be sortened to metandry

[07:27:01.0000] <jgraham>
erg

[07:27:02.0000] <jgraham>
With more of the original letters

[07:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
You can't just mix Greek and Latin like that :-(

[07:29:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Television says you can, and I believe television.

[07:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Truth in Television (literally)

[07:30:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(or should that be visually)

[07:31:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
It'd go with literally.

[07:31:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
s/It'd/I'd/

[07:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
"I've compromised some on my position, that means the rest of the compromise has to come from you"

[07:37:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
And that sort of idea is precisely why you can win by starting from a position more extreme than what you actually want.

[07:54:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmph.  "Fragment identifier semantics are independent of the URI scheme and thus cannot be redefined by scheme specifications."

[07:55:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
I guess I have to memorize the percent-encoding for # now for use in data URIs.

[07:55:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Note to self: %23.

[07:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
and %25 for %

[07:56:01.0000] <zcorpan>
iirc

[07:57:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, hrm.

[07:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That means that trying to use htmlspecialcharacters() will fail rarely but badly.

[07:57:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Why would you ever use htmlspecialchars() on a data: URL?

[07:58:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, except insofar as you have to on any URL included in an HTML document, I guess.

[07:58:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
I don't know why it would break in that light.

[07:58:02.0000] <Lachy>
wow, apparently there are XBL2 implementations now, used as part of some XForms implementations

[07:58:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
There are XForms implementations?

[07:58:04.0000] <Lachy>
haha

[07:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
this is one, apparently http://wiki.orbeon.com/forms/doc/developer-guide/xbl-components-guide#TOC-Why-use-XBL-and-not-simply-XSLT-

[08:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder if there's non-trivial content out there depending on # being valid in data URIs

[08:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
AryehGregor: Because you're dumb and don't know how to escape things properly.

[08:00:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
TabAtkins, well, obviously if you double-escape with htmlspecialchars(), it will break.  Or if you only escape with that and not rawurlencode() also.

[08:00:03.0000] <TabAtkins>
The latter is my intention.

[08:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, it is valid in data URIs. data:text/html,<p id="test">foo</p>#test

[08:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
unfortunately, Firefox's implementation is broken

[08:01:02.0000] <workmad3>
AryehGregor: people escape with the wrong things all the time... htmlspeciarchars on a uri is a bit of a biggie, but CGI escaping a url is quite common :)

[08:01:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: As a data character, not fragment separator

[08:01:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
Since I think people are at least somewhat familiar with htmlspecialchars, while browsers tend to be pretty lenient with urls and won't often break things if you forget to urlencode it.

[08:01:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, and WebKit's.

[08:01:06.0000] <Lachy>
oh :-(

[08:02:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Lachy, only Opera actually interprets # in data URLs per spec AFAIK.

[08:02:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
(haven't tested IE8)

[08:02:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I can test if anyone has a testcase

[08:02:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
That doesn't allow HTML documents anyway in data: URLs, right?

[08:02:04.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Changed in 10.50 I'm pretty sure

[08:02:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
So I'm not sure how you'd test.

[08:02:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, changed which way?

[08:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
IE's data URL implementation is totally broken

[08:04:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
On another note, how many months' worth of spam e-mails from "Approved VIAGRA® Store" do I need to mark as spam before Gmail takes the hint?

[08:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
if you try to load a data URL, it gives an error. If you try to load it into an iframe, it navigates the whole page to the data URL, and fails to load it

[08:05:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy: Find an image that happens to contain data that can be represented as #?

[08:05:02.0000] <Lachy>
how many times does GMail have to ignore your requests to treat it as spam for you to take the hint that it isn't!

[08:05:03.0000] <Lachy>
:-)

[08:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: # is part of the content now

[08:12:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I think

[08:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
Dashiva, using an img with a data URL, IE does treat the # as data

[08:15:01.0000] <Lachy>
see the live dom viewer, and download what I uploaded to its clipboard

[08:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, the save feature still seems to be very broken.

[08:16:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yay, interop, RFC 3986 can take a hike.

[08:16:02.0000] <Philip`>
AryehGregor: Could set up a filter to delete it automatically

[08:16:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Philip`, hmm, clever idea.

[08:16:04.0000] <AryehGregor>
Maybe I will.

[08:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
wow, even Opera can handle the data URI with a hash in it, when used as an img src

[08:17:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: It's not so much that, it's just URLs beginning with javascript: and data: are special-cased

[08:17:02.0000] <Lachy>
that's unfortunate :-(

[08:18:00.0000] <gsnedders>
It's better than fucking up every URI scheme totally

[08:20:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
gsnedders, RFC 3986 explicitly says that URI schemes can't special-case fragment syntax, as annevk pointed out.

[08:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Yes, but it isn't just fragment syntax that is special cased. It the whole URI-reference that is special cased.

[08:21:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
Really?

[08:21:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
/me looks more closely

[08:22:00.0000] <gsnedders>
If the string starts with javascript: or data:, it isn't treated as a URI at all

[08:23:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
It seems like RFC 3986 allows URIs like data: and javascript:, with the path component defined as path-rootless.

[08:23:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
In what way is it not treated as a URI at all?  It looks like a URI to me.

[08:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Indeed.

[08:24:01.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: It's not actually parsed as a URL. The leading string is stripped, and pct-encoding is decoded.

[08:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: <iframe src="javascript://foobar%0Adocument.write('a')"></iframe>

[08:26:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
So how is that not parsing as a URL?  It's just a URL that doesn't use the hierarchy syntax.

[08:26:01.0000] <AryehGregor>
RFC 3986 allows those as URIs.

[08:26:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Basically just a leading "something:" following by anything you like, and then a fragment.

[08:26:03.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: Because we'd have to separate it up into segments, and would only apy attention to path

[08:28:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Well, you do.  The path is just one segment, namely, the whole URL other than the initial "data:" and the trailing fragment.

[08:28:01.0000] <Dashiva>
And query part

[08:28:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Yeah, that too.

[08:28:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
Was about to say.

[08:28:04.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: No, we don't.

[08:28:05.0000] <gsnedders>
Look at that example above

[08:28:06.0000] <gsnedders>
AryehGregor: The whole thing is in the host

[08:28:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
What about it?  The path is "//foobar\ndocument.write('a')".

[08:28:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
No, there's no host.

[08:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How not?

[08:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
A path can't start with //

[08:29:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Because an authority starts with //

[08:29:03.0000] <AryehGregor>
URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

[08:29:04.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks AryehGregor has got his ABNF wrong

[08:29:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty

[08:29:06.0000] <AryehGregor>
                  / path-absolute

[08:29:07.0000] <AryehGregor>
                  / path-rootless

[08:29:08.0000] <AryehGregor>
                  / path-empty

[08:29:09.0000] <AryehGregor>
path-rootless = segment-nz *( "/" segment )

[08:29:10.0000] <gsnedders>
It doesn't match path-absolute, path-rootless, or path-empty

[08:29:11.0000] <AryehGregor>
segment-nz    = 1*pchar

[08:29:12.0000] <AryehGregor>
It matches path-rootless.

[08:29:13.0000] <gsnedders>
pchar doesn't contain /

[08:30:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Hmm.

[08:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Otherwise that would be ambiguous for cases like //gsnedders.com

[08:30:02.0000] <AryehGregor>
Touche.

[08:30:03.0000] <Dashiva>
javascript: URLs are just an abomination, we shouldn't try to treat them otherwise

[08:30:04.0000] <gsnedders>
The only alternation there that can start with // is "//" authority path-abempty

[08:30:05.0000] <AryehGregor>
Okay, you win.

[08:31:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
data: and javascript: don't follow URI syntax at all, so no reason to quibble over the fragment or query parts.

[09:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Whoops

[09:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think I broke the spec

[09:58:00.0000] <boogyman>
nice goin!

[10:02:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, it's okay now

[10:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me has moved the multipage thing to a new server and hopes it won't break much

[10:03:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, why is the notification API not under navigator?

[10:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does the notification API let twitter put tweets into Growl?

[10:06:01.0000] <annevk>
i think so

[13:09:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Good writeup, Sidnicious.

[13:09:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
Hey, thanks.

[13:10:00.0000] <AryehGregor>
Where?

[13:10:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
The list

[13:11:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
TabAtkins was helping me work through the basics of the idea a couple of days ago.

[13:11:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
whatwg, AryehGregor 

[13:14:00.0000] <annevk>
omg Buenos Aires was so much better

[13:15:00.0000] <annevk>
it's fricking freezing here

[13:17:00.0000] <Sidnicious>
annevk: One of my coworkers just came home from Argentina. He's been hanging around 85°F beaches for the last month, suddenly he's back in winter NYC.

[13:17:01.0000] <Sidnicious>
He's perplexed, to say the least.

[13:20:00.0000] <svl>
annevk: be glad you missed the -10 days

[13:32:00.0000] <annevk>
svl, I suppose :)

[13:32:01.0000] <annevk>
about 1800 emails read/deleted so far

[14:09:00.0000] <annevk>
did anyone file a bug on s/srcdoc/srcDoc/ yet?

[14:21:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
what, about removing it, annevk?  Yes.

[14:22:00.0000] <annevk>
no, about properly naming the IDL attribute

[14:22:01.0000] <annevk>
more or less every addition has a bug for removal, that's not very special :)

[14:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
re the obsoleting old versions thing, see my comments on the text/html rfc from a couple of days ago on irc

[14:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
the gist of which was that the currrent text/html rfc does the same as far as i can tell

[14:38:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, still no File.URL? -- http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/FileAPI/#dfn-file

[14:38:01.0000] <annevk>
with everyone implementing I hope that gets fixed soon :/

[14:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
send feedback again

[14:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
or e-mail arun directly

[14:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
the latter is probably best

[14:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Saying "the old version already has that problem" doesn't seem like a good reason for not fixing it, in general

[14:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
my argument is that there is no problem

[14:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
If there's no problem, why does it matter what the current text/html RFC says?

[14:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose it does matter if people who say the new one has a problem don't also acknowledge that the old one has the same problem

[14:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: it demonstrates that there's no problem

[14:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
the argument is "you can't publish a registration that doesn't do X" but the existing registration doesn't do X, so it is a counterproof.

[14:49:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Equal rights

[14:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You can't just go changing what is considered a conforming mime-type registration because a new spec for the format has been released

[15:09:00.0000] <annevk>
http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/jsvec/TypedArray-spec.html

[15:24:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hum

[15:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Geez, Lief's turned into sort of an ass.  >_<  Dude doesn't seem to know how to accept disagreement.

[15:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me searches for [^</]\bd[dt]\b\|[^<]/d[dt]\b (just putting that here in case i need to search for it again, don't want to have to work that out again)

[15:30:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Escaped pipe, hum

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
emacs

[15:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
doesn't use regular regexps

[15:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
That won't work if the dd/dt is at the beginning of a line

[15:37:01.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it's okay if everything's indented, though

[15:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me would probably do something more like (?<!<)(?<!</)\bd[dt]\b in Perl

[15:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: in emacs, [^...] matches newlines

[15:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
in perl too, if oyu have /s

[15:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
iirc

[15:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
Then you still have the problem at the start of the file :-)

[15:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
i know what's at the start of the file :-P

[15:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
(In Perl /s only changes the meaning of ".", \n is just like any other character in any other patterns)

[15:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
well then :-P

[15:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me was assuming line-based processing so you wouldn't have \n at the beginning

mm, tasty figcaptions

[21:00:00.0000] <karlcow>
good for figcaptions but summary is a mistake imho. element/attribute name being the same. People have hard time to understand the diff betweenn cite="", <cite>

[21:00:01.0000] <karlcow>
oh well.

[02:48:00.0000] <annevk>
it seems the Chrome team is set on beating our version number :-)

[02:48:01.0000] <Dashiva>
They could just pull a slackware

[02:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Or a Windows

[02:49:01.0000] <annevk>
<figcaption> and <summary>, really?

[02:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
apparently

[02:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
i still think <legend> is better

[02:50:02.0000] <annevk>
/me longs for <legend>

[02:50:03.0000] <annevk>
yeah

[02:50:04.0000] <annevk>
toally

[02:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
especially for <details>

[02:50:06.0000] <Hixie>
well for both really

[02:50:07.0000] <annevk>
is there any element name remotely similar to <figcaption>?

[02:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
optgroup, colgroup

[02:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
keyge

[02:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
n

[02:51:03.0000] <annevk>
well, they're the other way around

[02:52:00.0000] <annevk>
oh well

[02:52:01.0000] <Dashiva>
figurecap?

[02:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
other way around?

[02:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
keygen is the other way around

[02:52:04.0000] <Hixie>
optgroup is basically the same thing

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
<option> group -> optgroup, <figure> caption -> figcaption

[02:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
but <legend> is the right answer.

[02:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
just not the popular answer.

[02:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
yay consensus.

[02:53:04.0000] <Hixie>
(assuming we even get consensus.)

[02:53:05.0000] <Dashiva>
Are you tempted to remove it from w3c HTML5 just so it can be added later when <legend> is viable? :P

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
i tried to remove <details>

[02:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
there was an uproar

[02:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
never though i'd see that many complaints about doing something shelley asked for so quickly

[02:54:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Only because you did it voluntarily

[02:54:04.0000] <Hixie>
thought, even

[02:54:05.0000] <Dashiva>
You have to wait for the WG decision

[02:56:00.0000] <annevk>
personally i'd rather drop them both too until <legend> works

[02:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah me too but too many people want them now

[02:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
next time i think of adding something like this i'll make sure it really works, parser-wise, before adding it, since it's easier to keep something popular out than to remove it later.

[02:57:01.0000] <annevk>
yeah, and it's pretty costly at the price of two new elements :/

[02:57:02.0000] <Hixie>
no kidding

[02:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to raise an objection :-)

[02:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i think there's no chance of either <legend> or removal being a WG decision

[02:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
still, at least we can point to this as proof the WHATWG is trying to cooperate :-)

[02:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Just find another w3c technology that predates details and does the same thing :P

[02:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me still doesn't see why making a new element name is worse than overloading an existing name to have different meanings depending on context

[03:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
More rules to remember

[03:00:01.0000] <annevk>
I wonder if the chairs thought of the consequences for html5-diff when they started making things complex

[03:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: having four element names for legends instead of two makes it twice as hard to know which to use when you are in a situation where you need to use one

[03:00:03.0000] <annevk>
Maybe I should just define [HTML5] in html5-diff as the WHATWG copy :p

[03:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[03:00:05.0000] <Hixie>
works for me :-P

[03:00:06.0000] <Hixie>
the whatwg copy references it :-)

[03:29:00.0000] <annevk>
Hixie, should I file a bug on s/srcdoc/srcDoc/ ?

[03:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
would it improve the web?

[03:30:01.0000] <annevk>
it would improve consistency

[03:30:02.0000] <annevk>
I agree it looks less nice

[03:30:03.0000] <annevk>
but it makes matters more predictable I think

[03:30:04.0000] <annevk>
due to stupid decisions earlier on

[03:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
i dunno that it really helps much in this case

[03:33:01.0000] <jwalden>
/me points out http://whereswalden.com/2010/01/29/humor/ for the benefit of anyone here not reading p.m.o (and who, incidentally, have by far the highest probability of understanding it of anyone who might read it :-) )

[03:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[03:33:03.0000] <roc>
what would srcDoc improve consistency with?

[03:34:00.0000] <roc>
aren't all HTML attributes all lowercase?

[03:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
he's talking about the IDL attribute

[03:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Shouldn't it be src-doc in HTML to be srcDoc in IDL?

[03:36:00.0000] <annevk>
not necessarily

[03:36:01.0000] <annevk>
e.g. contentEditable

[03:36:02.0000] <jwalden>
I don't think I care, but: document.createElement("a").hreflang

[03:36:03.0000] <jwalden>
may be the odd man out

[03:36:04.0000] <annevk>
yeah, I just noticed that one

[03:36:05.0000] <Hixie>
i think looking for consistency in HTML and its APIs is a fool's errand

[03:36:06.0000] <Hixie>
i'd just go with what makes the most sense

[03:36:07.0000] <annevk>
I guess hreflang sets a precedence for both

[03:37:00.0000] <jwalden>
I see hreflang as similar because the first word of the compound is abbreviated; are there others like that which are capitalized?

[03:37:01.0000] <Dashiva>
.tBodies

[03:37:02.0000] <jwalden>
or not-abbreviated but lowercase-mashed

[03:38:00.0000] <jwalden>
whoa, that's some funky caps

[03:38:01.0000] <jwalden>
/me never would have guessed .tBodies existed

[03:39:00.0000] <annevk>
others are e.g. tabIndex, contextMenu, accessKey, maxLength, readOnly, useMap, isMap

[03:39:01.0000] <jwalden>
bgColor counters hreflang's precedent

[03:39:02.0000] <Dashiva>
I guess it's a bit off topic since there's no a content attribute for it

[03:39:03.0000] <jwalden>
or maybe it's only lower-mash if all parts are abbrevs?

[03:39:04.0000] <annevk>
and a bunch of presentational and obsoleted attributes, noShade, noHref, bgColor, ...

[03:40:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me continues on the fool's errand

[03:41:00.0000] <annevk>
vAlign counters that somewhat

[03:41:01.0000] <annevk>
or colSpan

[03:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
ignore the deprecated ones when looking for a pattern to hang this lampshade on

[03:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
we can argue those won't be used by authors so aren't relevant

[03:57:00.0000] <jwalden>
enctype, I'm guessing, isn't deprecated, maybe argues for "short" compounds not being capsed

[03:58:00.0000] <jwalden>
but I'm getting tired of racking brains for obscure element names :-)

[04:00:00.0000] <annevk>
I'm fine with srcdoc, but I also successfully argued for itemId, itemType, itemValue, itemRef, itemProp, and itemScope

[04:01:00.0000] <annevk>
so I guess in the future someone can point at this line on krijnhoetmer.nl and blame me if they got confused

[04:01:01.0000] <Dashiva>
There I'd argue item is a common prefix, so the camelcase is useful

[04:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
However, srcdoc is abbreviated enough to be equally readable with or without

[04:02:01.0000] <Dashiva>
(in my opinion)

[04:02:02.0000] <annevk>
hopefully the confused people of the future will concur

[04:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
i agree with Dashiva 

[04:05:01.0000] <jwalden>
yeah

[04:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm no network person, so if anyone can find a better way to do this:

[04:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://damowmow.com/playground/demos/websocket/saturate.html

[04:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
...that would be awesome

[04:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm going to bed now.

[04:49:04.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[05:26:00.0000] <annevk>
is anyone following stuff like http://www.w3.org/TR/contacts-api/ ?

[05:27:00.0000] <annevk>
related, anyone knows if cloning technology is getting any better?

[05:53:00.0000] <annevk>
whoa

[05:53:01.0000] <annevk>
/me just read a bunch of messages in the <canvas> accessibility thread

[05:54:00.0000] <annevk>
>3000

[06:32:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me waves

[06:32:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(from Oslo)

[06:33:00.0000] <annevk>
Oslo is cool

[06:33:01.0000] <annevk>
you should go skiing

[06:34:00.0000] <annevk>
some skiing stuff of mine is at Lachy's place

[06:34:01.0000] <annevk>
feel free to borrow

[06:34:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Probably too big for me, tall man.

[06:35:00.0000] <annevk>
the glasses will be alright :)

[06:35:01.0000] <annevk>
but yeah, the outfit, dunno about that :p

[06:35:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has glasses of his own in Scotland :P

[06:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me needs to decide what to do today

[06:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, I thought you weren't arriving in Oslo till tomorow?

[06:37:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Wrong.

[06:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
I would go skiing, but unfortunately I can't for at least another 4 to 6 weeks. :-(

[06:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
First thing I need to do is get lunch, though

[06:42:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me thinks wondering around town might be a good idea for today, seeming everything closes soon

[06:43:00.0000] <annevk>
how are the roads?

[06:44:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Bit icy, not bad

[06:44:01.0000] <annevk>
there's a bicycle at Marcos' place

[06:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Better than lkpg

[06:44:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hasn't ridden a bike much i years

[06:45:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I also have no idea where Marcos' place is :P

[06:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, what street are you in?

[06:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Storgate

[06:46:01.0000] <gsnedders>
*gata

[06:46:02.0000] <gsnedders>
/me fails Norwegian

[06:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
oh, is that where your hotel is, or just where you are now?

[06:47:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Both :)

[06:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm in the Anker Hotel

[06:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok. They didn't put you where I thought they might, closer to Opera.

[06:48:02.0000] <Lachy>
but at least it's not too far. Just jump on bus 34 or 54 on monday morning

[06:48:03.0000] <annevk>
you should've asked for an apartment

[06:49:00.0000] <annevk>
they're 5min from Opera rather than 25

[06:49:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me really doesn't care

[06:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
OK, I'm going to head into town and get food and wonder around

[07:13:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me is befuddled by smart compilers rearranging his computations for efficiency.

[07:14:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I understand that moving the division into a non-critical path so it can be done at the computer's leisure is *theoretically* a good thing, but the fact that this actually translates into a 10% speedup is astonishing.

[07:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's more befuddling because CPUs rearrange computations too

[07:19:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I know!  It's crazy.

[07:19:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I would never have thought to swap my algorithm around to move where the division takes place.

[07:19:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I think I'm spoiled by not ever coding in C?

[07:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Was it moved out of a loop or something?

[07:20:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or into a rare conditional branch?

[07:20:02.0000] <Philip`>
/me wouldn't expect simple shuffling to affect much

[07:21:00.0000] <annevk>
oh yes, <1300

[07:21:01.0000] <annevk>
only 800-900 to go to get back to the old level

[07:22:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I was doing an array walk, based on the value in the array.  Previously the division was required to find the next index and I simply collected the value, but I swapped it so I use the division to collect values, and use the array val itself as the next index.

[07:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(In more specific terms, I was factoring a number using a slightly modified Sieve of Eratosthenes.  Originally I stored the smallest factor of the index, now I store the largest factor.)

[07:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
You mean so it can now do the division and memory fetch in parallel, or something like that?

[07:26:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I presume that's what is happening, yes.

[07:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sounds plausible

[07:56:00.0000] <annevk>
<1000

[07:56:01.0000] <annevk>
really time for breakfast/lunch/dinner or any kind of food now

[08:22:00.0000] <annevk>
<900

[08:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Maybe you should make a graph, like Hixie :P

[08:23:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me is plesed to find that gsnedders did not get stuck in Katrineholm

[08:23:02.0000] <jgraham>
sp?

[08:24:00.0000] <jgraham>
Ah no, I spelt it right

[08:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: The train from Lkpg was 20/25 mins late

[08:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: But not enough for the 45 min change

[08:27:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Also: is it bad my first thought upon realizing I had 20 mins to wait was, "Where can I get fika?"

[08:29:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Also: food is so fucking expensive.

[08:29:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: Could have been worse. You might have thought "help, I'm covered in bees", which, given the climate, would have implied that you were having weird hallucinations.

[08:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
Aren't you supposed to be enjoying Norway or something?

[08:30:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It's dark outside now, and everything's shut.

[08:30:02.0000] <gsnedders>
And I have no friends.

[08:30:03.0000] <gsnedders>
/me just had lunch

[08:30:04.0000] <jgraham>
Sounds quite like Linkoping

[08:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Yeah, just lunch costs more for worse food.

[08:32:00.0000] <jgraham>
(!!)

[08:33:00.0000] <annevk>
you should go to better places then :)

[08:33:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Hey, I'm on my own in a city I've never been in before.

[08:42:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, zcorpan submitted a patch for web-apps-tracker

[08:42:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'm pretty sure that "help, I'm covered in bees" is a pretty bad thought to have regardless of the climate.

[08:43:00.0000] <gsnedders>
On the bright side, it seems warmer here

[08:43:01.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: It is like -17 here

[08:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: What if you're a bee keeper?

[08:44:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
In that case you're shouting for help.  Still no good.

[08:44:02.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I guess I got out in time

[08:44:03.0000] <Philip`>
Maybe you're covering yourself in bees and running around as a publicity stunt

[08:44:04.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: It didn't seem -17 when I left at 8am though

[08:44:05.0000] <gsnedders>
/me loves Philip`'s ridiculous alternative reasons for things

[08:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Why is it ridiculous?

[08:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'm sure I've seen that on TV

[08:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think they say help

[08:46:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd still rate that a not-good situation to be in, personally.

[08:46:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
I suppose it's the best of all the bad situations?

[08:46:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, maybe bees is also the name of some kind of delicious batter

[08:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And you need help to eat it all up because it's too much for one person

[08:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
Being covered in batter doesn't seem good in any situation

[08:47:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Better than bees

[08:47:03.0000] <Philip`>
Just ask the fish

[08:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
Fish will complain about batter, not about bees

[08:48:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
If you covered a fish in bees, it would complain.

[08:48:02.0000] <Dashiva>
That's because a fish in a position to be covered in bees has bigger trouble than just the bees (i.e. being on land)

[08:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
/me supposes this isn't any more ridiculous than the "vampires vs werewolves" debate he had in the bar last night.  But at least he was drunk then.

[08:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: You're making unsafe generalisations

[08:50:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I refuse to consider underwater bees.

[08:50:02.0000] <Philip`>
The fish might have fashioned itself a raft of bees, so it can float safely across shallow water

[08:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
s/on land/out of water/

[08:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Can it truly be said to be 'covered in' bees, then?

[08:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
The weight of the fish is sufficient to ensure it actually remains in the water, with the bees providing just enough buoyancy to not sink

[08:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: Yes, the raft also has a roof made of bees, to keep the rain off

[08:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Oh, yes, the fish wouldn't want to get wet.

[08:53:03.0000] <Dashiva>
I don't think being inside a structure counts as covered

[08:53:04.0000] <Dashiva>
It would have to be quite tight-fitting

[08:55:00.0000] <jgraham>
gsnedders: It was like -20something this morning

[08:55:01.0000] <gsnedders>
It didn't feel that bad.

[08:55:02.0000] <jgraham>
Possibly all your nerve endings have withered in the cold

[08:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Do you know how hard it is for a fish to collect bees and knit them together?

[08:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's going to be tight-fitting just to save on the material and construction costs

[08:59:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Then it's not a raft anymore

[09:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
Now you're just quibbling over technicalities

[09:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
As opposed to when? :P

[10:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder how many are just running noscript or somesuch

[11:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
Dashiva: I guess a lot of them are running flashblock or similar. Especially given Gruber's audience and the legendarily bad performance of flash on non-Windows platforms

[12:26:00.0000] <annevk>
<500

[12:26:01.0000] <annevk>
back to normal I suppose

[12:26:02.0000] <annevk>
took a little longer than expected

[12:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gruber's readers use iPhones

[12:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me read DF last week on Maemo with Flash disabled for stability reasons

[13:21:00.0000] <Viper550>
I find it ridiclous that afaik, your forum is so standards incompliant

[13:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
What would be the value of spending effort making it more compliant?

[13:29:00.0000] <jgraham>
Or, to put it differently, are you offering to spend the effort needed to provide a different forum?

[13:31:00.0000] <annevk>
we could look for a more compliant forum

[13:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
Sure

[13:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
what does it do that is not compliant?

[13:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
we can always change the spec if there's no value in making it more compliant

[13:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, that's cheating :-)

[13:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
but it uses a bunch of presentational attributes

[13:40:01.0000] <Lachy>
it also seems to declare the encoding wrongly with <meta> as ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8

[13:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
ah, well then it's probably not optimally accessible

[13:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
and will have i18n issues

[13:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
best to fix the problems

[13:44:00.0000] <annevk>
seems I haven't checked the forums since september

[13:47:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, FAQ is still somewhat wrong

[13:47:01.0000] <annevk>
though I guess removing HTML5 everywhere will just make matters more confusing at this point

[13:48:00.0000] <Viper550>
plus phpbb2 is olllllllld

[13:48:01.0000] <annevk>
whoa, Dell sucks with international pricing

[13:48:02.0000] <Viper550>
maybe just go to fluxbb?

[13:49:00.0000] <annevk>
Adamo is EUR 720 in US and EUR 1350 in the Netherlands

[14:17:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Yeah, I know glazou figured that out and bought a computer last TPAC.  Get one of us americans to buy for you and ship it?

[14:23:00.0000] <annevk>
no it's okay, though that's an interesting offer I might take you up on one day :)

[14:27:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
I'd be happy to help if you ever need it.  Market segmentation is annoying as hell, even if I *usually* benefit from it.  ^_^

Google product login policies make no sense

[16:14:01.0000] <annevk>
one tab with Gmail and one tab with Google Reader

[16:14:02.0000] <annevk>
login to Gmail and then refresh Google Reader

[16:14:03.0000] <annevk>
Google Reader asks for a password

[16:15:00.0000] <annevk>
going to reader.google.com does not ask for a password

[16:15:01.0000] <annevk>
you'd think that more people hit this situation and that it would be fixed by now...

[17:00:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: I would guess that is an implementation bug, not a policy

[17:00:01.0000] <othermaciej>
unfortunately Google has no way to report bugs

[17:05:00.0000] <annevk>
btw: http://blogs.webtide.com/gregw/entry/websockets_ietf_v_whatwg

[17:06:00.0000] <annevk>
I added a comment with a link to http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=3724&to=3725

[17:07:00.0000] <annevk>
it also seems somewhat dubious to me to assert that none of "servers, routers, bridges, proxies, firewalls, caches, load balancers, aggregators, offloaders, ISPs, filters, corporate security policies, traffic monitoring, billing, accounting, shaping, application frameworks etc. etc." participates in the WHATWG

[17:08:00.0000] <annevk>
but whatever

[19:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: yeah especially given that the editor of the spec works for the third biggest web server implementor

[20:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
annevk: site seems to be down

[01:13:00.0000] <annevk>
seems to work for me

[01:13:01.0000] <annevk>
maybe it was down temporarily?

[01:13:02.0000] <annevk>
still no comments approved though

[01:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
it was down temporarily

[01:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: you don't need anything in websocket to do the negotiation of what frame types are supported, because you simply wouldn't use the frame types with an unsupporting server

[01:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: you know who the server is when you connect to it -- it's the server you specified

[01:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: how does the server know what frame types the client supports?

[01:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: it's the same as when you write a <form>, you know what form fields it's expecting, because you know the server

[01:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: send a frame of that type and see if you get a reply from your script

[01:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: also: the knowledge of frame types may need to be in the UA, not the JS-level code, if you expect frame types to have special processing and the UA is supposed to send them transparently

[01:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: or have the script feature-test and inform the server

[01:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
can you give an example of such a type?

[01:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm having difficulty working out what that would look like

[01:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
let's say there was a frame type that implies gzip compression by the sender and gzip decompression by the client

[01:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
(don't forget that this is intended to be as close to pure TCP as we can get)

[01:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh, that's easy

[01:21:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(so that your compression/decompression code could be C++ in the browser, instead of coded in JS)

[01:21:04.0000] <Hixie>
just include a Supports-Gzip: header in the handshake

[01:21:05.0000] <othermaciej>
is it ok to add arbitrary headers to the handshake?

[01:21:06.0000] <Hixie>
                                   yes

[01:21:07.0000] <Hixie>
er, yes

[01:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
then that seems to be all the negotiation mechanism needed

[01:22:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it might be useful to define a convention for known frame types, but that is not really needed until frame types exist beyond the 1.0 set

[01:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
indeed

[01:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
all I wanted to know is that there is a mechanism whereby the negotiation can be added compatibly, and without extra round trips

[01:23:01.0000] <othermaciej>
using custom headers seems fine

[01:23:02.0000] <othermaciej>
especially if we can later define one with a standard meaning

[01:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not new to this forwards-compatible language design gig :-P

[01:24:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I am trying to take Greg's feedback seriously, since I care about the protocol being workable and useful for server-side implementors, but he mixes up useful technical feedback with sudden leaps to feature requests, and process rants

[01:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
but I'm not new to this peel-the-useful-feedback-out-of-the-rant gig

[01:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[01:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
i've been trying the same for a while myself

[01:25:03.0000] <othermaciej>
he actually has tried to implement it in a server-side component that could potentially be production quality

[01:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I wonder if there is any other general implementation besides the Python module that Google coded

[01:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
of the server?

[01:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
i made a toy in perl: http://damowmow.com/playground/demos/websocket/blank-server.pl

[01:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
and another in pascal: http://software.hixie.ch/fun/cuddlyworld/src/websocket.pas

[01:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
pascal!

[01:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's what my toy MUD is written in :-)

[01:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
pascal these days is not what it used to be

[01:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
it has generics, method pointers, variants, the works

[01:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
method and operator overloading, classes, reflection

[01:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
(not to mention a function pointer syntax that actually makes sense, unlike C/C++)

[01:37:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders whether it's worthwhile getting a week ticket for the public tansport

[01:37:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(which, because I'm under 20, is only 105 NOK)

[01:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: other implementations i'm aware of include Kaazing's

[01:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: also http://rainbows.rubyforge.org/sunshowers/

[01:38:01.0000] <annevk>
gsnedders, if you're planning on using it a lot, maybe

[01:39:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk: It's 26 for a single jounrney, so I only need to use it five times for it to be worthwhile

[01:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: have any of the server implementations generated feedback on the spec?

[01:39:02.0000] <gsnedders>
Even if I just used it to get to the office each day it's be worthwhile

[01:39:03.0000] <gsnedders>
*it'd

[01:39:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(going by the usual rule of "implementation that does not result in any feedback is suspicious" rule)

[01:39:05.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: that is cool though

[01:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: Kaazing basically invented the protocol as it stands now, if i'm not mistaken

[01:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: oh, that's the guy who pushed the version with the HTTP-based handshake?

[01:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
i think so

[01:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
i can't remember his name though

[01:40:04.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: but I thought you automatically rejected all feedback from server-side developers, since they are not represented in the WHATWG

[01:40:05.0000] <Hixie>
which is highly embarassing

[01:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am dismayed at this breach of cabal protocol

[01:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: well as i pointed out on the list just now... i'm a representative of the third largest HTTP server developer by active domain count

[01:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: and we wrote an implementation for the biggest one

[01:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: and i just replied to the feedback from the second biggest

[01:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
so...

[01:42:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: but... but... what about proxy developers?

[01:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
like squid? had a huge thread with squid a few months ago

[01:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
took into account their feedback (also rejected a bunch of it, admittedly)

[01:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think the main reason people suggest i'm ignoring feedback is that i don't share the same priorities they do

[01:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
for grammar, s/i don't share the same priorities they do/we don't share the same priorities/

[01:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
i put ease of server-side implementation very high on the list, they put reducing the total number of TCP connections higher

[01:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
for instance

[01:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
Michael Carter, that's the Kaazing guy who did the original WebSocket design

[01:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
great guy

[02:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: Per what we said before, I'll probably come over to yours sometime between 5 and 7 this evening

[02:34:00.0000] <Lachy>
gsnedders, ok

[02:45:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, is it only Document.URL that has it uppercase?

[02:45:01.0000] <annevk>
I guess we could change WebSocket/EventSource

[02:45:02.0000] <annevk>
but then I don't really care

[02:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd really rather not change names for the sake of capitalisation at this point

[02:46:01.0000] <annevk>
oh, Stream.URL

[02:47:00.0000] <annevk>
I still find it wrong we use URNs for this...

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
me too

[02:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's just going to screw up URNs in the future

[02:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's basically going to make it impossible to use URNs for anything but this in Web browsers

[02:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
but I have already tried to make that point, and the people who presumably care about URNs didn't believe me, so... not much I can do

[02:56:00.0000] <annevk>
it mostly that the meaning of the urn:uuid is very application-specific, but there's no way to tell if someone handed you that URL

[02:57:00.0000] <annevk>
we could register urn:local-file or some such to make it less of an issue but I don't see why filestream: or some such cannot work

[02:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
ditto

[02:58:01.0000] <annevk>
btw, should I draft a counter-proposal to UMP once I'm done with other XHR feedback?

[02:59:00.0000] <annevk>
either create a new AnonXMLHttpRequest() constructor or maybe make XHR take a new constructor argument

[03:00:00.0000] <annevk>
and then always set origin to null and the credentials flag too

[03:00:01.0000] <annevk>
othermaciej, ^^

[03:12:00.0000] <annevk>
argh

[03:12:01.0000] <annevk>
making everything in XHR byte-based instead of Unicode-based is a pain

[03:13:00.0000] <annevk>
not hard

[03:13:01.0000] <annevk>
just a pain

[03:13:02.0000] <annevk>
well, it's hard figuring out how to do it easy I guess

[03:15:00.0000] <annevk>
in retrospect I should've let Hixie do XHR and work more on the CSSOM instead

[03:15:01.0000] <csarven>
The URI to full whatwg spec is such a trap, if I end-up at it using Firefox, guaranteed chaos/doomed/crash/lockup.

[03:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk: I'm so glad you took XHR on!

[03:20:00.0000] <annevk>
basically ASCII case-insensitive and all need to go and be replaced with byte equivalent terms instead

[03:20:01.0000] <annevk>
though maybe I can just use case-insensitive then

[03:21:00.0000] <annevk>
just like HTTP does

[03:22:00.0000] <annevk>
it's actually slightly weird imo that HTTP uses case-insensitive and case-sensitive while the same WG also states that the character encoding in usage is not defined

[03:22:01.0000] <annevk>
or some such

[03:22:02.0000] <annevk>
but maybe case-insensitive "just works" for series of octets

[03:29:00.0000] <annevk>
/me wonders why http://www.defectivebydesign.org/shareipad does not have a share on twitter button...

[04:32:00.0000] <annevk>
sites using Flash was a real problem when trying to find more information about certain hostels online in Argentina by the way

[04:33:00.0000] <annevk>
basically, we ended up picking one of the hostels of which the site did not require Flash

[04:34:00.0000] <annevk>
threaded view in Opera Mail is now just like Gmail except faster

[04:34:01.0000] <annevk>
pretty neat

[04:35:00.0000] <annevk>
/me had been using a flat view until trying to go through 4000 emails efficiently

[04:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Does it support multiple accounts yet?

[04:51:01.0000] <annevk>
character to byte conversion is complete btw; please review!

[04:52:00.0000] <annevk>
Dashiva, you mean something other than multiple IMAP accounts on the server?

[04:53:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Multiple SMTP accounts

[04:53:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Or more accurately, multiple sending addresses

[04:55:00.0000] <annevk>
there's a from dropdown when composing

[04:55:01.0000] <annevk>
no idea whether it works

[04:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Sounds like the old system

[04:59:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It breaks sent mail saving and such

[05:17:00.0000] <annevk>
damn video codecs

[05:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
http://twitter.com/reckless/status/8431718270

[05:57:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Dashiva: I don't get his argument

[05:57:01.0000] <virtuelv>
at all

[06:03:00.0000] <Dashiva>
virtuelv: In response to the claim that the number of flash-enabled UAs is dropping

[06:08:00.0000] <virtuelv>
yes

[06:08:01.0000] <virtuelv>
but it still doesn't make sense

[06:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the reason people use flashblock and similar is because there are sites that break (read: youtube) if they rid themselves of flash

[06:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
There are plenty of sites that don't break without flash, though

[06:11:00.0000] <Steve^>
and plenty that do

[06:11:01.0000] <Steve^>
So either you block the crappy ones and have a full browsing experience or uninstall flash and have a 90% experience

[06:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That's the point. Flash is part of the full browsing experience.

[06:12:01.0000] <Steve^>
so.. we need flash installed?

[06:13:00.0000] <Dashiva>
That depends on your definition of need

[06:13:01.0000] <Steve^>
and your definition of browsing experience, apparently

[06:14:00.0000] <Dashiva>
You don't need flash to browse in general, but you need flash to browse sites that use flash

[06:14:01.0000] <Steve^>
exactly

[06:14:02.0000] <Steve^>
so you need flash to browse the full experience of the web

[06:14:03.0000] <Steve^>
Youtube is included in that

[06:18:00.0000] <annevk>
not anymore

[06:18:01.0000] <Steve^>
ok, ok, but the statement holds

[06:18:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Unless you use firefox :)

[06:20:00.0000] <Steve^>
Would it be impossible for firefox to use H.264 because of the licensing?

[06:21:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes, no, depending on ideology

[06:21:01.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
it would *cost* firefox to use H.264 - in the same way as it does for Chrome/Opera

[06:22:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
but then it should also cost content providers who encode in H.264

[06:22:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
And, iirc, it will, starting sometime next year?

[06:22:02.0000] <Dashiva>
There are also problems with using OS-provided codecs, although people disagree on how signficant those are

[06:23:00.0000] <Steve^>
Who does the money go to/

[06:23:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
MPEGLA

[06:24:00.0000] <Steve^>
why do Apple want to push a technology that mean its content providers need to pay money to those people

[06:24:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Because they've already paid for h264

[06:24:02.0000] <Steve^>
Apple have

[06:25:00.0000] <Steve^>
but by content providers, I read Youtube or anyone hosting video on their website

[06:25:01.0000] <virtuelv>
in terms of flash, though: I see mostly only flash I want to see, but then again, I block graphical ads

[06:25:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
Because they're short-sighted, imo.

[06:25:03.0000] <Dashiva>
Apple also has a strong interest in devices, where hardware h264 is already established

[06:25:04.0000] <virtuelv>
and it's not the flash I want to see, rather the video

[06:25:05.0000] <TabAtkins>
(I agree fully with ROC's view on the matter.)

[06:25:06.0000] <Steve^>
Long term I'll need to pay money to put home-made videos on my website?

[06:26:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
In h.264, likely yes.

[06:26:01.0000] <Steve^>
That will just empower flash to keep going, surely

[06:26:02.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, you can't create really flash for free either

[06:26:03.0000] <Dashiva>
/me moves the 'really' over a few words

[06:27:00.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
lol

[06:27:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Take youtube, the whole h264 business is hidden from the content creators

Dashiva: what about when the cost won't be hidden?

[06:31:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Then it won't matter much if they're using h264 inside or outside of flash, will it?

[06:32:00.0000] <Steve^>
I take Youtube to be the content provider, the uploader wouldn't be charged unless Youtube decided to pass on the costs

[06:33:00.0000] <Steve^>
which may become a way for Youtube to become more profitable

[06:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Would mean waving goodbye to the long tail, though

[06:37:00.0000] <virtuelv>
btw, for web video, I don't really get the quality argument

[06:38:00.0000] <virtuelv>
the quality of the majority of uploaded video is so abysmal anyhow that a slightly lower-quality codec won't matter

[06:39:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Quality isn't an absolute, it's a trade-off against size. Better codecs let you optimize in either direction

[06:39:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also a tradeoff against encoding time

[06:39:02.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
virtuelv: I don't get *that* argument

[06:39:03.0000] <GarethAdams|Home>
virtuelv: you're saying, cameraphones make rubbish quality video so we should standardise on a solution that stops production-quality video from being shown off at full quality?

[06:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Encoding is only once, though

[06:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also the quality of the codec is not the only major factor, the quality of the encoder implementation is pretty important too

[06:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
and popular codecs have more and better encoders, so you can get better videos even if the codec is technically no better than another

[06:41:01.0000] <Steve^>
Does OGG violate any of these factors?

[06:41:02.0000] <Dashiva>
No

[06:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Theora's main lack is that h264 has an established position, e.g. in the form of companies already paying for it and exposing patent risk, and in the form of hardware support

[06:43:01.0000] <Dashiva>
The squabbling over quality is less important, for reasons Philip` pointed out

[06:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: If you're someone like Youtube and you have a day of videos to encode per minute, I imagine the overall encoding time is an issue

[06:43:03.0000] <Philip`>
and if you're a user of Youtube then the latency of encoding is important, because you want to point people at your video as quickly as possible

[06:43:04.0000] <Steve^>
Hardware support shouldn't be an issue for Apple as they control the hardware they use

[06:44:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`: Those seem lesser concerns than bottom line costs and profits, though

[06:44:01.0000] <Steve^>
It would be an issue for say, Opera Mini, which has a very large target hardware

[06:44:02.0000] <Philip`>
and if you're encoding and hosting videos by yourself then you probably still don't fancy spending an hour compressing your videos with really good compression before uploading them

[06:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
Dashiva: Isn't the cost basically CPU time + storage + bandwidth, so encoding time is an important part of that concern?

[06:46:01.0000] <Steve^>
Philip`, it is of course a concern, but not has important as the others

[06:46:02.0000] <Philip`>
(and most videos are viewed approximately zero times so bandwidth is negligible)

[06:47:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I wonder what the stats on that actually are

[06:48:00.0000] <Dashiva>
And it's easier to grow server CPU time than it is to grow the end user's bandwidth :)

[06:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
Fig 7 in http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jcliu/Papers/YouTube-IWQoS2008.pdf indicates some numbers

[06:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
Looks like 50% have <400 views

[06:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
and 90% have <10000

[06:54:01.0000] <Steve^>
that's more than 0

[06:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
(in 2007)

[06:56:00.0000] <Steve^>
this argument is a little pointless unless a competing video codec happens to have terrible encoding times

[06:56:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Seems quite possible that their data collection method is biased towards more popular videos, given how they crawled the site)

[06:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
Steve^: Not a lot more than 0 :-)

[06:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Well, maybe a bit

[07:02:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Steve^: From what I understand, Google is happy with Youtube's current profitability.

[07:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
TabAtkins: You mean its current lack of profitability? :-)

[07:04:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
All I know is, last article I read where they were asked about it, they coyly suggested that it wasn't *nearly* as unprofitable as everyone assumes.

[07:10:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Completely differently unprofitable

[07:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Hmm, if I actually look at numbers instead of guessing, it seems like encoder CPU time and disk storage are about equally cheap, and bandwidth is around a thousand times higher, to within a couple of orders of magnitude)

http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8850

[12:05:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Just when you thought it was safe to focus on technical details...

[12:06:00.0000] <annevk>
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=8849 is interesting

[12:46:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
annevk: A better variant of that idea would be to allow @sandbox on <html>, but that's already been suggested to be possible on any element - it fails open in legacy clients, though.

[12:47:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least, though, the escaping situation is less dire if you don't do it right - worst case the page will end prematurely because an attacker emitted </html>.

[12:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
<plaintext sandbox>

[12:48:01.0000] <Philip`>
That'll have safe legacy behaviour

[12:49:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Once you do that, though, what's the point of @sandbox?

[12:49:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
<plaintext> prevents the <script> from running anyway.

[12:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
In supporting browsers it would parse the context as sandboxed HTML instead

[12:51:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
...that makes sense.  Hmm.

[12:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
How about just serving text/html-sandboxed?

[12:52:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That doesn't let you specify which sandboxing behaviors you want.

[12:53:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
Though, of course, if you then do <html sandbox>...

[12:53:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
That is, if you do that and serve it with text/html-sandboxed.

[12:53:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
That seems like a good idea.

[12:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
No point making it so complex that people won't bother using it

[12:57:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
I've added a comment to the bug along those lines.

[12:57:02.0000] <TabAtkins>
No more complex than iframe sandboxing.

[12:57:03.0000] <Philip`>
Does <iframe sandbox src> require that the content is text/html-sandboxed?

[12:57:04.0000] <TabAtkins>
No, it doesn't require it.  It'll just fail open if you don't.  Same thing here.

[12:57:05.0000] <annevk>
it wouldn't fail for cross-origin

[12:58:00.0000] <annevk>
at some point we might need a global script language switch

[12:58:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Well, partially.  You'd get the different-origin protection, at least.

[12:58:02.0000] <Philip`>
I guess it'll be common for people to either forget to set the content-type at all, or to accidentally set it back to text/html later when they're not paying attention, which wouldn't be much fun

[12:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and they wouldn't notice until someone exploited it)

[12:59:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
Shrug.  The alternative is encoding the content in such a way so that it can't be interpreted as html at all by legacy clients.

[13:00:00.0000] <TabAtkins>
At least it's a problem that will go away with time.

[13:00:01.0000] <TabAtkins>
(As legacy clients drop off.)

[13:16:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, trying to figure out when enableStyleSheetsForSet was renamed in Mozilla is somewhat of a pain with Bugzilla not giving me answers and HG Blame not going back to when CVS was still used

[13:18:00.0000] <annevk>
oh, it never was renamed

[13:18:01.0000] <annevk>
hmm

[13:20:00.0000] <annevk>
I guess it must have been a private email conversation back then

[13:21:00.0000] <annevk>
oh well, it does not matter, history will record it as a typo I made

[13:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
If you didn't find it already: CVS blame still exists and works, for the pre-Hg code

[13:28:00.0000] <annevk>
yeah, found it when looking a little longer

[14:10:00.0000] <smaug___>
annevk: to look for changes in mozilla tree before hg time, use http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/ or http://mxr-test.konigsberg.mozilla.org/

[14:10:01.0000] <smaug___>
the latter one has links to both hg and cvs

[14:11:00.0000] <annevk>
thanks, already found what I needed

[15:59:00.0000] <annevk>
smaug___, note that <h1><h2> may be relevant because <h2> closes <h1>

[15:59:01.0000] <annevk>
iirc

[15:59:02.0000] <annevk>
smaug___, so you want to use <div> instead if you were to actually use that in example code
