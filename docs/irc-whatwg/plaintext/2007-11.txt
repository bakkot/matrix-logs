they didn't check robots.txt, either

[17:01:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: clearly, a big tic tac toe fan

[17:01:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I mean, I don't read robots.txt everytime before I read a site

[17:02:00.0000] <jruderman>
gsnedders: you need the "Grab robots.txt" Firefox extension

[17:02:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me doesn't use Fx

[17:03:00.0000] <jruderman>
gsnedders: it has an option to show whether the current page is robot-excluded in the status bar

[17:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: no, but presumably one would do so before crawling the entire site

[17:03:02.0000] <jruderman>
(just kidding, i made that up)

[17:03:03.0000] <gsnedders>
jruderman: knowing how useless some extensions are, that's believable :)

[17:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: maybe I would. depends how busy I am.

[17:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: i'd hope your software would, at least :-)

[17:04:02.0000] <jruderman>
lol at "The clouds of tagging"

[17:04:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: oh, I was talking about doing it all manually

[17:05:00.0000] <chipig>
roy needs to making posse badges.

[17:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: this was clearly an automatic thing

[17:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
If you're writing some automated web-page-downloader that only downloads one page per site, should you still respect robots.txt (given that fetching it would double the number of requests)?

[17:05:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: well, from the size of your site, that's obvious. I was hardly serious

[17:05:04.0000] <gsnedders>
(I mean, when was I ever serious?)

[17:05:05.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: :-)

Hmm. Sleep would be a good idea I guess

[17:23:00.0000] <karlUshi>
robots.txt is useful for certain things but not all unfortunately. 

[17:23:01.0000] <karlUshi>
I think it is useful to say, I want this indexed.

[17:24:00.0000] <karlUshi>
but very poor for blocking access.

[17:25:00.0000] <karlUshi>
For some bots, I have been using .htaccess instead of robots.txt

[17:25:01.0000] <karlUshi>
things like this in the .htaccess

[17:25:02.0000] <karlUshi>
SetEnvIfNoCase User-Agent "Technoratibot" bad_bot

[17:25:06.0000] <karlUshi>
Allow from all

[17:25:07.0000] <karlUshi>
Deny from env=bad_bot

[17:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
hm, dave raises an interesting point about auto-pausing cue ranges

[17:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
since seeking affects them now, it's hard to know when to fire the autopause

[17:50:00.0000] <bradee-oh>
Hixie: okay okay

[17:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[17:50:02.0000] <bradee-oh>
Hixie: you've beat me over the head with "not important enough for v1"

Hixie: enough times...  that I'll let it go  :)

[17:50:05.0000] <Hixie>
i'm mostly chanelling aaron on this i think

[17:53:00.0000] <bradee-oh>
Hixie: okay okay  =D

[19:47:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: "mouseydown"?

[19:47:01.0000] <jruderman>
on http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-contenteditable.html

[19:47:02.0000] <jruderman>
is that a typo?

[19:54:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me snickers

[19:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
heh

[20:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
fixed.

[20:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
(good catch.)

[20:02:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: "The in-memory representation is known as 'DOM5 HTML'" -- i think that's confusing and it should be "HTML5 DOM" instead

[20:02:01.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: i often say "DOM 2 Core" to mean "DOM Level 2 Core", but "DOM5 HTML" does not mean "DOM Level 5 HTML"

[20:03:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: it's not just me; see http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM_Levels for example

[20:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I find DOM5 HTML confusing too

[20:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML5 DOM makes more sense

[20:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
just as there is an SVG1.2 DOM, not DOM1.2 SVG

[20:05:00.0000] <jruderman>
'Comments that contain the string "-->" can be represented in "DOM5 HTML" but not in "HTML5" and "XHTML5".' mmm, non-serializable doms

[20:05:01.0000] <jruderman>
well

[20:05:02.0000] <jruderman>
they can be serialized as scripts to generate them

[20:05:03.0000] <jruderman>
(i have a script that does that)

[20:09:00.0000] <jruderman>
it even has a text/html mode that whines about some non-serializable things, such as BR elements with children

[20:09:01.0000] <jruderman>
but it doesn't complain about adjacent text nodes

[20:31:00.0000] <jruderman>
what does "This specification is independent of the various proprietary UI languages that various vendors provide." mean?

[20:31:01.0000] <jruderman>
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#relationship1

[20:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think it's supposed to be some sort of odd aspersion on XUL and XAML and the like

[20:39:00.0000] <jruderman>
the sentence after it, sure

[20:39:01.0000] <jruderman>
but i don't understand the sentence i pasted

[20:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: btw please send feedback to one of the lists (or me directly); with few exceptions, i don't track feedback sent on irc

[20:50:01.0000] <jruderman>
you should track feedback sent on irc ;)

[20:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
maybe

[20:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't :-)

[20:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
re "DOM5 HTML", i just took the previous name -- DOM2 HTML, with its earlier DOM1 HTML -- and incremented the number to 5.

[20:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah but those were part of the DOM, not part of HTML, as would be the current practice

[21:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: *shrug*

[21:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
same language, new version...

[21:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it's hardly the world's most important issue

[21:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
true

[00:11:00.0000] <jacobolus>
hsivonen: is there a version of the conformance checker which would be of a reasonable size, and able to run w/o a server component, to include with a text editor?

[00:26:00.0000] <jacobolus>
hsivonen: incidentally, it doesn't seem to like "irc://…" hrefs in a elements.  is that proper behavior?

[00:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: well, there's no specification for the IRC scheme, which makes any occurrence non-conforming

[00:57:00.0000] <jacobolus>
hmm.  but it's quite useful to put in different schemes in hyperlinks of html documents :)

[01:05:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jacobolus: from a purely conformance POV, nothing that isn't registered should be used :)

[01:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jacobolus: there is currently only a server version.

[01:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jacobolus: the current way to integrate with a text editor is to run the HTTP server on localhost and to use the Web service API locally as an interprocess communication protocol

[02:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
is the semicolon at the end of a sql statement part of the sql statement?

[02:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
Most SQL APIs only accept a single statement-like-thing with no semicolon, so I assume the actual statement doesn't include a semicolon (and it's handled by command-line UIs instead), but that's not very helpful if you want to be precise about what SQL calls a statement

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
what i really want to know is what are people going to implement?

[02:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
I thought the semicolon was required

[02:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/c-api-multiple-queries.html talks about statements "separated" by semicolons (though only when you turn on an appropriate flag), so they're separators rather than terminators in that kind of API

[02:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-stmt-prepare.html - "You should not add a terminating semicolon (“;”) or \g to the statement."

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but sqlite seems to do it differently

[02:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
sqlite3_complete is the only thing that the documentation says cares about semicolons, and that's just designed for command-line input - I'm fairly sure the rest of the API doesn't need semicolons (unless that's being hidden by all the language bindings I've used)

[02:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I vaguely think different systems differ in whether a trailing semicolon is ignored or a syntax error, but can't really remember)

[03:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
need is one thing; i'm worried about allow

[03:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
<div> is gonna be a pain

[03:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i really don't want <body><div>test</div></body> to be conforming (or <body><div><img ...></div></body>)

[03:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
but people are having issues with my suggestion of <form><p>...</p><p>...</p></form> instead of <form><div>...</div><div>...</div></form> (where ... = <label> ... </label>)

[03:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me no longer thinks about block vs inline when writing HTML because it's just a waste of time and makes no practical difference, and would like it if conformance checkers didn't complain about that, but maybe that's just laziness :-)

[03:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think it makes a difference, but i conveniently have to sleep now and can't defend my position. :-)

[03:15:01.0000] <Hixie>

[07:42:00.0000] <rene32>
Good morning! ;-)

[07:51:00.0000] <rene32>
I have an HTML5 feature request. Where do I have to go to so that this is discussed and maybe considered?

[07:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
rene32: http://www.whatwg.org/mailing-list#specs should be a good place to send ideas

[07:56:00.0000] <rene32>
Hmm, I don't like mailinglists. Isn't there a place where I can just drop the idea and then leave? :-)

[07:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rene32: well, if you don't take the trouble of subscribing to a list and sending your use cases there, you could state them here and risk them getting forgotten

[07:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
There's http://forums.whatwg.org/ too

[07:58:00.0000] <rene32>
hsivonen: Sounds good :-D

[07:58:01.0000] <rene32>
Maybe I subscribe, discuss the idea and unsubscribe again.

[08:02:00.0000] <rene32>
In case someone is interested in the idea: I'd like to see a parameter "ellipsis" that tells the browser to replace some text by "..." in case the space to render all text is not sufficient. I think I'll write an email about it to the list.

[08:04:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Doesn't CSS3 do that already?

[08:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
rene32: I can tell you right away that there's almost zero chance of that making it into HTML5

[08:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
rene32: you might have better luck with CSS

[08:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
rene32: I wouldn't be too surprised if CSS overflow was already extended like this

[08:05:01.0000] <rene32>
Wrong place?

[08:05:02.0000] <Dashiva>
text-overflow: ellipsis

[08:05:03.0000] <rene32>
So I have the right ideas but post them in the wrong places and too late.... tough luck :-D

[08:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Opera has some support for it, but it's a pain to use

[08:06:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Don't know about other browsers

[08:06:02.0000] <rene32>
is that CSS3?

[08:07:00.0000] <rene32>
it's probably end ellipsis only (opposed to centre ellipsis)

[08:07:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Yes

[08:08:00.0000] <rene32>
9.5 has it implemented already?

[08:08:01.0000] <Dashiva>
It used to be in css3-text, but was removed. It's also listed on msdn

[08:09:00.0000] <rene32>
What does it mean "it's listed on msdn"?

[08:09:01.0000] <Dashiva>
Meaning IE supports it somehow, but I don't know the details myself

[08:09:02.0000] <OmegaJunior>
That's the documentation network for Microsoft Programmers: msdn.microsoft.com

[08:10:00.0000] <rene32>
I know. But I did not know what it means when something is listed there. I know what it means if something is listed on eBay though ;-)

[08:10:01.0000] <OmegaJunior>

i'm just curious as to why i haven't gotten any

[15:22:04.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose it could be because people are travelling to the plenary

i think i've now said no to about half a dozen suggestions by this Eugene T. S. Wong person.

[17:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
it really is nothing personal... it's just that in each case, the arguments against were stronger than the arguments in favour. :-(

[18:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
yay, i broke the 3500 barrier!

[18:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
down to 3482 issues

[01:14:00.0000] <tantek>
Hixie, re: nigh-on-impossible to implement href="" on all elements, it's actually not that bad.  if you think of "hyperlinkness" as just a behavior that anything can have, it's quite trivial.  As if you could just wrap an <a href> element (assuming proper inline/block embedding etc.) around the element being hyperlinked.

[13:32:00.0000] <Hixie>

(oh, we're doing algorithms in computing at school now — vitally important for me, obviously)

[13:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
i never did algorithms. missed out on a bunch of stuff that i really should have learnt.

[13:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
big O() notation, sort algorithms, etc

[13:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
oh, I mean the _really_ simplistic algorithms like in both of our specs

[13:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(well, arguably, they aren't that simple in parts, but compared with some stuff, they are)

[14:04:00.0000] <gsnedders>
and then we get to implement the algorithms… in BASIC.

[17:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm having connection issues, so i'm gonna go home and will be back online later to continue replying to all this mail

[01:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[01:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
how about a rel value that disables sending of referer headers for a link?

[01:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
people seem to go to extreme lengths right now with document.open and document.written meta refreshes and all kinds of nonsense

[01:27:00.0000] <jruderman>
for a long time, i argued that things like "meta refresh doesn't send referrer" and "links from https to http send no referrer at all" are bugs, maybe even security problems

[01:28:00.0000] <jruderman>
how about making the rel strip out the path&query from the referrer but leave the hostname

[01:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
seems simpler just to allow the whole thing to be dropped

[01:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
why would it be a security problem?

[01:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
how is not sending referer conceivably a security bug?

[01:34:00.0000] <Hixie>
rel=noreferer now in the spec.

[01:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is that really a RELationship?

[01:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
not really, but hey, rel is pretty damn poluted already anyway

[01:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
i considered rel=untrusted, but i figured why pretend

[01:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
we could add an attribute, but that's far heavier

[01:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
(adds an attribute to two elements, DOM attributes to match, etc)

[01:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me hopes that TPAC will have better wifi connectivity than XTech

[01:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me expects GPRS/EDGE/HSDPA roaming to be insanely expensive and perhaps even broken

[01:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
tps usually have wifi.

[01:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
better wifi, i wouldn't count on.

[01:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
at least not at the start of hte week

[01:46:04.0000] <Hixie>
it usually settles down by about noon on wednesday

[01:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: XTech had none for people who weren't presenting the same day, so almost any connectivity would be better

[01:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[01:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
huh

[01:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
HTMLHeadElement.profile in DOM2 HTML is defined to return one URI

[01:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
but <head profile=""> in HTML4 is defined to take a space-separated list of URIs

[01:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
yum

[01:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
(HTML5 drops both)

[01:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
are there other attributes that take lists of URIs?

[01:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
or is it just profile (and now ping)?

[01:52:03.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess that happens when the operation/DOM nonsense is pushed to another spec

[01:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yeah, that's why i think it's totally stupid to suggest they should be split again. but whatever. :-)

[01:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how i should expose ping in the DOM

[01:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
did someone suggest that?

[01:53:03.0000] <Hixie>
i think ff3 just has a DOMString of absolute URIs

[01:53:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the input method attribute on WF2 whatever it was called takes a list on tokens and URIs

[01:53:05.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: oh it's a common request

[01:53:06.0000] <Hixie>
the xforms thingy?

[01:53:07.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[01:53:08.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how i handled that

[01:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
i bet i just ignored it

[01:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: "operational/DOM nonsense" is from Roy Fielding's survey "disagree" rationale

[01:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
/me notes searching for "input" and searching for "method" in the wf2 spec... not useful

[01:54:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yeah, the XForms thingy

[01:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
inputmode

[01:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: I wonder if anyone told him about SVG, MathML, XForms...

[01:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
crap. inputmode is just a DOMString.

[01:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
screwed myself again.

[01:55:04.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it's xsd:string in the XForms schema :-)

[01:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
good times.

[01:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok so what do i do for ping. Make it a DOMString with a parallel pingList that uses the DOMTokenList thingy, and then never actually put pingList in the spec because, you know, why bother?

[01:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
or do i actually do URI resolution

[01:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
do i have a DOMStringList for it?

[01:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
aaah so many options

[01:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aside: IIRC, XForms wasn't clear on whether IRIs are OK as inputmodes

[01:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me looks up the new ed with so many diffs

[01:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think i'll just make .ping return a DOMString of resolved absolute URIs

[01:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is a dumb API

[01:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i don't see what else to do

[02:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me doesn't find "IRI" in XForms 3rd ed.

[02:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
does this mean XForms isn't properly internationalized? :-)

[02:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
no diffs in the inputmode section

[02:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(schema-wise inputmode is the most complex attribute in HTML5)

[02:02:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(and in XForms they dodged it all with xsd:string)

[02:03:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, a DOMTokenList if resolved URIs?

[02:03:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I have written this in comments: "# XForms seems to allow IRIs when it talks about URIs."

[02:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder where I got that from

[02:04:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I also have "# Let's assume case, digits and symbols are mutually exclusive to cut down on possible permutations."

[02:04:02.0000] <hsivonen>
# "halfWidth" is deprecated

[02:04:03.0000] <hsivonen>
# Just assuming at least one token is required. The spec does not say.

[02:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess the spec wasn't unambiguous :-)

[02:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and WF2 imports the ambiguity

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: btw, I've made inputmode enumerated tokens case-sensitive

[02:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: HTML5 enumerated tokens are otherwise ascii-case-insensitive

[02:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the spec should probably say something about case-sensitivity when importing inputmode from XForms

[02:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if the S60 version of Opera will have actual inputmode support

[02:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Opera 9 that is

[02:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i expect to define inputmode explicitly or drop it completely when wf2 becomes part of html5.

[02:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: but then you can't do .ping = 'x y z'

[02:09:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok

[02:09:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: you have to use the API to add and remove URIs

[02:09:03.0000] <annevk2>
you can do setAttribute("ping", "x y z")

[02:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: sure, but that's inconsistent, you can set every other attribute

[02:11:00.0000] <annevk2>
ok, dunno really then

[02:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah me either

[02:11:02.0000] <annevk2>
i'm not sure what the use case is for a DOM attribute here anyway

[02:11:03.0000] <Hixie>
consistency

[02:11:04.0000] <hsivonen>
aside: something else profile='' and inputmode='' have in common is that they require absolute IRIs

[02:12:00.0000] <annevk2>
Hixie, in that case do the resolve URI thingie

[02:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh yeah i guess profile="" didn't allow relative ones

[02:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: yeah that's what the spec now says

[02:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
annevk2: :-(

[02:13:00.0000] <annevk2>
how does the spec deal with space separated lists of URIs then in "reflect"

[02:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
i added a paragraph there

[02:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
in fact that's all i changed

[02:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
see diff

[02:15:00.0000] <annevk2>
ah, refresh helps

[02:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm confused by issue-2

[02:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what to do about it

[02:16:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: about the ping UI req

[02:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whether the spec can/should require ping to be exposed in the UI

[02:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is seeing the death of an old business model: my mobile Internet is now fast enough to route Skype calls through for fraction of the cost circuit-switched calls cost

[02:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: oh i understand the issue. i just don't know what to do about it.

[02:19:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the telco sells me flatrate packet data but charges 0.25 euros per minute for circuit-switched video calls

[02:19:02.0000] <hsivonen>
oh sorry

[02:19:03.0000] <Hixie>
and there are lots of business models dying at the moment

[02:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
it's great

[02:19:05.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[02:19:06.0000] <Hixie>
breathing new blood into the human race

[02:19:07.0000] <Hixie>
or at least the capitalist part

[02:21:00.0000] <hsivonen>
off-topic, but I've never like the attitude of telco folks. 

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
back at the university, we had a course where the IP part was lectured by a guy who had been extending the Internet to Finland early on

[02:22:01.0000] <hsivonen>
and had later built the "Saudi Internet"

[02:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and then there were guest lectures from telcos talking about phone stuff

[02:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the different in attitude was striking 

[02:23:02.0000] <hsivonen>
a telco person showed a slide pondering what they can charge for

[02:23:03.0000] <hsivonen>
and it had a "per bullet" (in a game) bullet point

[02:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(now that I think of it, that would be the game version of Chris Rock's "bullet control" :-)

[02:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
what's shocking isn't so much their gall or greed but that it works

[02:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: actually, the failure of WAP and the rise of real browser engines and Internet connectivity on phones is some indication that the telco gall is no longer working like it used to

[02:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah they're slowly dying

[02:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
but not very fast

[02:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the main problem is that many countries allow telcos to control the handset features

[02:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that's evil

[02:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
it's frustrating that the business side of Nokia is blocking some technical goodness because Nokia needs to appease to telcos abroad where the telcos call the shots

[02:52:01.0000] <Lachy>
Another problem is that some countries allow locked handsets to be sold without an unlocked version avaliable

[02:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
am i really not explaining myself in this ping='' discussion, or is julian just not reading what i write?

[02:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
for the past like 3 e-mails he's asked me the same question, as far as i can tell

[02:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: that's the mechanism that they use to control handset features

[02:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me throws the ping="" mail onto the links pile and goes to bed

[02:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[02:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the major *business* innovation in Nokia 770, N800 and N810 is that the device doesn't have a GSM unit and, therefore, can bypass the phone sales channel in countries with bad laws

[02:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
how do they work without GSM?

[02:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: through wifi or routing via Bluetooth through a separate GSM device

[02:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: so I get to run VoIP software on the N800 and route the packets through my phone

[02:59:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok. So it's only really useful in areas where there's sufficient open wifi coverage

[03:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: in Helsinki, I use my N800 with the traffic routed through my HSDPA phone

[03:00:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[03:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: that I can't get proper VoIP software for the S60 handset is just an artificial barries

[03:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
barrier

[03:01:02.0000] <hsivonen>
people can ship all the VoIP software they want for the N800

[03:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
gah, i couldn't help replying.

[03:09:01.0000] <Hixie>
now i'm really going to bed

[10:47:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders how to define quoted-string unescaping.

[10:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
Copy someone else's definition that looks good?

[10:48:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: bleh. :P

[10:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
HTTP implementations tend to be rather confusing, sadly

[11:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me can't actually find the code in Fx that does it

[11:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: There's things like http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/netwerk/protocol/http/src/nsHttpChannel.cpp#2989 that appear to be handling quoted-string in at least one case

[11:07:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me hopes nobody wants to quote a string with a \ in it

[11:24:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: yeah, there seem to be all kinds of different implementations all over the sourcebase, all with their own bugs (though there are a very finite number of bugs I've ever seen)

[11:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: from what I've seen, there's no reason _not_ to follow the RFC 2616 meaning (however undefined that happens to be)

[14:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: With the link changes, it doesn't need the definition "A subdocument is said to be a child of the document it is a subdocument of." any more

[15:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also s/a // in "the end of the a sequence"

[15:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand your first comment

[15:01:02.0000] <Philip`>
That sentence is defining what "a child" means, but that term is never used in the rest of the document

[15:01:03.0000] <Hixie>
ah ok

[15:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if anyone cares about infinite or cyclic sequences

[15:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
well there's no UA conformance criteria

[15:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
so it doesn't really matter all that much

[18:02:00.0000] <KwonHikaru>
hello people

[18:04:00.0000] <KwonHikaru>
waaaaa

[00:46:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv - any idea of there is an opera:config option that corresponds to the "Display tooltips" option that you can set in Preferences?

[00:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I find opera:config#UserPrefs|DisplayLinkTitle but that's for disabling display of content of title attributes

[00:47:01.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: gimme a moment and I'll find out

[00:47:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
thx

[00:47:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
My dad is asking me because he says he finds it really annoying to have tooltip text popping up every time he hovers over links.

[00:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I tell him, get used to it.

[00:48:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
But he seems unsatisfied with that answer.

[00:49:00.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: easy solution: turn on the status bar

[00:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv - OK

[00:50:01.0000] <virtuelv>
then the tooltips will only show up for links which have their title attribute set

[00:57:00.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: opera:config#UserPrefs|PopupButtonHelp

[00:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv - thanks very much

[00:59:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
oddly named but so are a lot of other options I guess

[01:00:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Yeah, I guess it's named that way for historical reasons

[01:00:01.0000] <virtuelv>
again, according to opera:config we're also caching figs

[01:00:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
huh?

[01:00:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
btw, would help if the search box on the opera:config page searched the help text for the options instead of just the option names

[01:01:00.0000] <virtuelv>
(Image caching, actually, but any english-speaking version person would think of them as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig )

[01:01:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I searched for "tooltips" but finded nothing

[01:01:02.0000] <virtuelv>
MikeSmith: I know

[01:01:03.0000] <virtuelv>
I'd like to see the helpfile integrated into that page

[01:01:04.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me opens up BTS to file an enhancement request

[01:01:05.0000] <MikeSmith>
damn, looks like my BTS access has been disabled for some reason

[01:04:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv - You telling me about image caching because I asked you about it earlier?

[01:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Also by the way, will you be able to call into the WAF meeting today?

[01:05:01.0000] <virtuelv>
no, just to mention how opera:config options aren't always logically named

[01:05:02.0000] <virtuelv>
yeah, I'm calling in

[01:06:00.0000] <virtuelv>
We got a fair bit of work done in the late session yesterday

[01:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
virtuelv - yeah, I was scribing it -- though not very well since my body is still on Tokyo time, where it was 3 or 4am during that session

[06:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[06:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
not sure how to handle rel="up up" in relList

[06:45:00.0000] <annevk>
just make it non-unique unordered collection

[06:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
no i mean in relList

[06:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
relList only deals with uniques

[06:48:00.0000] <annevk>
so you'd have to change that I guess

[06:49:00.0000] <annevk>
or remove support for "up up"

[06:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[06:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[06:49:03.0000] <Hixie>
i could just warn that relList doesn't expose that

[06:50:00.0000] <annevk>
i suppose

[06:50:01.0000] <annevk>
for the current scenarios scripting isn't that important anyway

[06:50:02.0000] <annevk>
scenario*

[06:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[07:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
woot, finished the 'links' folder

why do people only ever ping me when I'm asleep?

[08:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
so what do people think of type=a on <ol>

[08:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
should it be in or out?

[08:55:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm thinking out.

[08:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
but there's a thread asking for it to be in.

[08:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
type=a?

[08:57:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie - was already deprecated in HTML4, right?

[08:58:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so seems like it should be put to rest

[08:58:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
for good

/me and anne look at the history of the whatwg

[18:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
anne: http://hixie.ch/specs/html/forms/web-forms-3 is the last version of wf2 to be on my site

[18:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://hixie.ch/specs/html/forms/xforms-basic-1 is when it was called "xforms basic"

[07:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hixie: Your issues list system is stripping leading asterisks from the lines in messages

[07:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I have no idea if that's a trivial problem, or if it's related to the whole mail encoding problem that affects other messages and that I guess is non-trivial to fix)

[10:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: got an example?

[10:24:00.0000] <Philip`_>
Hixie: http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/cgi/issues.cgi/message/%3C689CD652-3320-11D9-8ACF-000A95AD3972%40myrealbox.com%3E vs http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-November/002344.html

[10:24:01.0000] <Philip`_>
and http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/cgi/issues.cgi/message/%3C472BA9D4.1000607%40cam.ac.uk%3E vs http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007Nov/0043.html

[10:24:02.0000] <Philip`_>
Oops, I should have said it's stripping lines which have leading asterisks, not just stripping the asterisks

[10:24:03.0000] <Philip`_>
(I see the same broken output on the whatwg.org/issues version of the emails)

[15:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixe, re video/ogg, looks like there's a draft RFC for video/ogg being written

[15:16:01.0000] <doublec>
this one? https://trac.xiph.org/browser/experimental/ivo/drafts/draft-xiph-rfc3534bis.txt

[15:17:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[15:18:00.0000] <annevk>
I think that's why it says video/ogg

[15:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I just didn't realise that existed before I sent my mail about it 20 min ago

[15:21:00.0000] <annevk>
aah

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yeah i really don't know anything about this, i just took the advice of people who claimed authoratative knowledge

[21:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
fantasai, of course you can

[21:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hey Lachy 

[21:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
hi

[22:02:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
hello

[22:02:01.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
can html5 be used today?

[22:03:00.0000] <jwalden>
lots of it is, in existing browsers :-)

[22:03:01.0000] <jwalden>
be more specific about what you want to use

[22:03:02.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
well, it's for a web framework called merb

[22:04:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
right now we're discussing xhtml/html issues

[22:04:01.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
and trying to figure out what we should default to serving

[22:05:00.0000] <jwalden>
HTML is generally a safer choice, because then you don't have to do content negotiation or deal with two different DOMs

[22:05:01.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
yeah

[22:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
assuming you mean serving xhtml as application/xhtml+xml

[22:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
browser xhtml implementations also tend to be less thoroughly tested and optimized

[22:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
since the web is pretty much html

[22:06:03.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
people are going to use it to serve xhtml as text/html, no matter what we do

[22:07:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
so this is more about reasonable defaults

[22:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
serving xhtml as text/html is not so great either

[22:08:01.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
oh, i know

[22:08:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but will probably cause fewer practical problems than serving different MIME types to different browsers

[22:09:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
*nods*

[22:09:01.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
we also have a bunch of helpers for creating code snippets

[22:09:02.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
image tags, etc.

[22:10:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
at the moment, they're producing xhtml syntax (trailing slashes for empty elements)

[22:10:01.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
which was what brought me here, really

[22:11:00.0000] <webben>
raspberry-lemon: Can your framework give developers a choice?

[22:11:01.0000] <webben>
(perhaps even a choice of content negotiation)

[22:11:02.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
yes

[22:11:03.0000] <webben>
raspberry-lemon: So this is literally about what to use as a default serialization?

[22:11:04.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
yes

[22:11:05.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
we'd like to use html

[22:12:00.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
but we know that if we go for html4.01, we'll have lots of confused users

[22:12:01.0000] <webben>
confused by what?

[22:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
HTML5 allows the trailing slashes

[22:14:00.0000] <webben>
If users are going to be confused by HTML 4.01 syntax, then they seem likely to be confused by a whole new version of HTML.

[22:14:01.0000] <webben>
Seems the only risk here is that users get confused and produce invalid documents.

[22:15:00.0000] <webben>
By using an XHTMLism.

[22:15:01.0000] <webben>
The documents will still "work" in browsers.

[22:15:02.0000] <raspberry-lemon>
right

[22:17:00.0000] <webben>
The risk of using HTML5 is greater, since the draft continues to change substantially.

[22:17:01.0000] <webben>
The potential benefits mainly revolve around features, but those come and go.

[22:18:00.0000] <webben>
I'd look at whether the more stable bits of HTML5 allows your developers to offer any benefits to /their/ end-users.

[10:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/demos/canvas/opera-3d/textured-cube.html

[10:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
Can't see any way to do lighting, so I can't even make a nice-looking cube :-(

[11:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[11:18:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Hixie: hm what?

[11:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
so the next issue i have to reply to is for an element in html5 for trees

[11:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
as in directory trees, family trees, that kind of thing

[11:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
like graph-style trees?

[11:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or tree view type trees?

[11:19:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie - I remember aaron leventhal mentioning that as a deficiency in HTML ... 

[11:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think datagrid provides the right semantics for n-ary trees

[11:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but unclear if it is desirable presentation for all cases

[11:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
well datagrid is more of a control, i'm looking for a way to mark up the data

[11:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. a family tree

[12:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders how to do it

[12:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
how to do what?

[12:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
the family tree thing

[12:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
RDF?

[12:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
/me ducks

[12:15:02.0000] <Hixie>
hmm, good idea

[12:15:03.0000] <Hixie>
/me embeds RDF into html5

[12:15:04.0000] <othermaciej>
family trees are not actually trees

[12:15:05.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[12:15:06.0000] <othermaciej>
in the general case

[12:15:07.0000] <Hixie>
they're graphs

[12:15:08.0000] <Hixie>
complicated ones in many cases

[12:15:09.0000] <othermaciej>
they are directed graphs with labelled edges

[12:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[12:20:00.0000] <annevk>
hmm, RDF

[12:20:01.0000] <annevk>
nice

[13:18:00.0000] <piratepenguin>
does either of firefox's video patch or Opera's video build support <audio>?

[13:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
WebKit nightlies support it I believe

[13:23:00.0000] <piratepenguin>
hmm cool but how would I test that on GNU/Linux, what's the simplest way?

Hixie, yo


2007-11-11
[16:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, that warning in the spec about providing an API for full screen video seems like unsubstantiated nonsense

[16:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
Flash already provides an API for playing full screen videos. YouTube and many other sites use it.

[16:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
also, using a video to trick a user into entering a password seems overly complicated, especially when there are more effective techniques employed by phishing sites already

[16:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
and there are things that browsers could do to prevent such techniques anyway, such as...

[16:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
1. The "Press Esc to exit full screen mode" automatically shown by flash clearly shows it's a video

[16:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
2. Showing video control tool bars when the mouse is moved or a key is pressed

[07:54:00.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, yt?

[08:09:00.0000] <Lachy_>
never mind, I'll send mail

[13:03:00.0000] <nie>
hello

[23:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa! I got a bug report about giving IDness to id.

[23:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
apparently there really is an XML language out there that by design allows multiple ids

[23:55:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: multiple IDs to an element or repetitions of the same ID?

[00:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
webben: same id value appearing many times, as far as I can tell

[00:37:00.0000] <webben>
hsivonen: Are they declaring something else as id with xml:id ?

[01:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
when will zcorpan be back from vacation?

[01:56:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is in awe over the ping idempotence discussion

[02:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: Re: ping: Surely Google and other ad providers could make their servers accept pings with a new HTTP method. I think Apache bugs are less of an issue with ping than with access-control

[03:32:00.0000] <Philip`_>
/me 's attempt at scheduling events in an HTML table gets somewhat more complex now he has an event at 1315-1415 instead of being nicely hour-aligned

[03:33:00.0000] <Philip`_>
(Are there nice ways to do this, without horrible code?)

[03:40:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Philip`_: Canvas? :)

[04:08:00.0000] <Philip`_>
Dashiva: That'd just be silly :-p

[04:08:01.0000] <Philip`_>
Currently I'm just using my nice hour-aligned table with a <div style="position:absolute; left:2em">...</div> in one cell to offset the contents by 15 minutes

[04:13:00.0000] <Philip`_>

hi

[10:23:01.0000] <mitsuhiko>
ValueError: Invalid tag name u'<DOCUMENT_ROOT>'

[10:23:02.0000] <mitsuhiko>
when trying to use html5lib with lxml's etree

[10:23:03.0000] <mitsuhiko>
(in fragment mode)

[10:27:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
(i get it in non fragment mode too apparently)

[11:59:00.0000] <jgraham>
mitsuhiko: re: lxml.etree; that is a known issue (sort of). Which exact release of lxml are you using?

[11:59:01.0000] <mitsuhiko>
jgraham: svn head

[12:00:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
guess it's the “fault” of lxml

[12:00:01.0000] <jgraham>
In that case try using lxml.html rather than lxml.etree

[12:01:00.0000] <jgraham>
We should have a better solution for 0.11

[12:01:01.0000] <jgraham>
(but I don't know what it will be yet ;) )

[12:01:02.0000] <mitsuhiko>
jgraham: lxml.html as etree impl?

[12:01:03.0000] <mitsuhiko>
or what do you mean?

[12:01:04.0000] <jgraham>
mitsuhiko: Yeah, as the etree imp.

[12:03:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
jgraham: ValueError: Invalid HTML tag name u'<DOCUMENT_ROOT>'

[12:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
Ah, maybe I haven't committed the wallpaper patch to svn

[12:04:01.0000] <jgraham>
/me goes to look

[12:05:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
oh btw. is mark pilgrim on irc from time to time?

[12:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
mitsuhiko: occasionally, as markp

[12:07:00.0000] <jgraham>
mitsuhiko: it seems that the fix for lxml 2.0 isn't in svn yet. I should be able to add it later this evening

[12:07:01.0000] <jgraham>
(this evening GMT)

[12:08:00.0000] <jgraham>
i.e. soonish but perhaps not immediatley

[12:08:01.0000] <jgraham>
I'm on the wrong computer atm

[12:08:02.0000] <mitsuhiko>
oh cool :)

[15:03:00.0000] <jgraham>
mitsuhiko: it turns out that there's an issue with the patch to make html5lib work with lxml trunk so it's not sutiable for checkin yet. I'll try and make some time to work on it in the next few days

[15:04:00.0000] <jgraham>
in the meantime, I believe we work with lxml 1.3.6, if that has the features you need


2007-11-14
[23:28:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
is there a way to tell the html5lib sanitizer to strip script tags instead of escaping them?

[23:28:01.0000] <mitsuhiko>
i have to aggregate some blog posts that are using digg/reddit buttons .)

[00:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hello internet

[00:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: hello!

[00:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hi hsivonen

[00:25:01.0000] <zcorpan>
what have i missed?

[00:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: ARIA discussion for starters

[00:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: also, FPWD publication has been delayed over charter and patent policy concerns

[00:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
fun

[01:34:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
is the conversion between <font size="..."> to css em/% defined somewhere?

[01:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
css2.1 has something informative, i think

[01:37:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
zcorpan: thanks a lot

[01:37:01.0000] <mitsuhiko>
found it

[03:21:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
anyone has a "powered by html5lib" logo? :D

[03:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is very unhappy about the effects of upgrading to Leopard

[03:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
/me seeks to do something productive now

[03:57:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
hsivonen: i'm switching to the ubuntu ltls soon :)

[03:57:01.0000] <mitsuhiko>
(next february. until then tiger)

[03:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mitsuhiko: yeah, the point of using Mac OS X is not having to do the kind of tweaking one would do on Ubuntu

[03:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
mitsuhiko: so when Leopard starts requiring tweaking, one might as well tweak Ubuntu

[03:59:01.0000] <mitsuhiko>
i have to tweak my os x more than i tweak my ubuntu

[03:59:02.0000] <mitsuhiko>
i just say port, mysql, and mud-mousing

[04:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(I'm most unhappy about calendar changes made on my phone no longer syncing to the Mac despite numerous troubleshooting attempts)

[04:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
this is the first OS X release that is a step backwards

[04:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like the UI fashion reached its peak in Tiger

[04:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
the new menubar, folder icons and Dock appearance are all worse than what Tiger had

[04:22:00.0000] <virtuelv>
does this mean that operating systems have a half-life, where every subsequent release only gets worse?

[04:22:01.0000] <virtuelv>
Windows peaked with Windows 2000

[04:22:02.0000] <virtuelv>
XP was a giant step backwards, and I never installed it

[04:23:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
It's an iterative cycle: up, down, up, down, needing continuous feedback.

[04:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: I think the data isn't sufficient for predicting a trend

[04:28:00.0000] <virtuelv>
might be, but both versions of windows since 2k has been downhill

660

[05:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
plus the html5 log i just marked as read without reading it (will use the tracker)

hey zcorpan

[05:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, where have you been lately? On holidays or something?

[05:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hi Lachy

[05:21:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah, thailand

[05:21:02.0000] <Lachy>
oh, cool

[05:22:00.0000] <Lachy>
I made those test case videos you asked for while you were gone, you should have an email about them somewhere

[05:22:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yep, replied

[05:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
they're perfect :)

[05:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, almost. There's a few things I need to change in them

[06:36:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: about <bdo>, "For example, an HTML+CSS user agent should implement these requirements by implementing the CSS unicode-bidi property." -- is that intended to be a SHOULD?

[07:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh great. XML 1.0, CSS and HTML5 all have different notions of whitespace

[08:47:00.0000] <dglazkov>
hello whatwg

[08:47:01.0000] <dglazkov>
have a question about client-side storage section

[08:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hello dglazkov

[08:50:00.0000] <dglazkov>
hello zcorpan

[08:50:01.0000] <dglazkov>
actually, it's about async execution

[08:50:02.0000] <dglazkov>
specifically, the degree of async execution

[08:51:00.0000] <dglazkov>
does tx run in:

[08:51:01.0000] <dglazkov>
a) separate thread

[08:51:02.0000] <dglazkov>
b) uses setTimeout-style continuation model

[09:07:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me doesn't really know

[09:07:01.0000] <dglazkov>
:) me neither

[09:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
dglazkov:b)

[09:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
dglazkov: it uses a callback

[09:37:02.0000] <dglazkov>
great!

[09:38:00.0000] <dglazkov>
that's easy

[09:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[09:39:01.0000] <dglazkov>
but what about "long epilogue" problem? what if there's a long-running bit of code right after the .transaction is called?

[09:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
then the sql takes a while to run

[09:40:00.0000] <dglazkov>
that kind of stinks, don't it?

[09:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
having any script that takes a long time is likely to block the user's UI, which is far worse anyway

[09:44:00.0000] <dglazkov>
right

[09:45:00.0000] <dglazkov>
ok, another quick question:

[09:46:00.0000] <dglazkov>
what's the utility of having the tx callback? Because it runs asynchronously and calls in turn asynchronous method(s), you can't really control the flow based on the data you're receiving. Couldn't an array of prepared statements be more logical?

[09:47:00.0000] <dglazkov>
Couldn't => Wouldn't

[09:50:00.0000] <dglazkov>
this is because of the chaining, isn't it?

[09:51:00.0000] <dglazkov>
i.e. function(tx) { tx.executeSql(..., function(tx, rs) { .. tx.executeSql() } }

[09:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
the only reason it's asynchronous is because the method might take a long time, and we don't want to block the UI while the method runs

[09:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
same reason executeSql() is async

[09:56:00.0000] <dglazkov>
what would you put in tx callback, other than a list of tx.executeSql statements?

[09:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
not much

[09:57:01.0000] <dglazkov>
here's where I am going with this

[09:58:00.0000] <dglazkov>
if tx callback is replaced with an array of prepared statements, I can execute statements truly asynchronously, without waiting on the main thread to finish

[09:59:00.0000] <dglazkov>
granted, the results will still be delivered via a queue

[09:59:01.0000] <dglazkov>
when the thread is done

[09:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
you could, but i'm not convinced the loss of expressibility is worth the potential performance gain

[10:00:00.0000] <dglazkov>
me neither -- just providing feedback

[10:00:01.0000] <dglazkov>
/me has a partially working implementation of the updated HTML5 spec

[10:00:02.0000] <dglazkov>
I will try to share it with the list later this week

[10:02:00.0000] <dglazkov>
Hixie, are you planning to add workerPool stuff to the HTML5 spec?

[10:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, eventually. right now the spec has so many new features I don't want to add stuff, for fear of the browsers getting lost and either giving up or implementing random stuff instead of staying mostly in sync.

[10:03:01.0000] <dglazkov>
good

[10:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
worker pools and communication pipes that can carry communication pipes are the two features i'm aware of that are currently waiting

[10:05:00.0000] <dglazkov>
.. and they are --- by far -- the coolest, IMHO

[10:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
possibly

[10:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
offline is probably better imho :-)

[10:07:00.0000] <dglazkov>
everybody has a favorite pet in the zoo that is HTML5 spec

[10:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[10:10:00.0000] <dglazkov>
do you have a feeling that a lot of HTML5 spec is really a DOM API?

[10:10:01.0000] <dglazkov>
I mean, there is a format, and there is a set of APIs

[10:10:02.0000] <dglazkov>
all in one big pile

[10:11:00.0000] <dglazkov>
/me wants everything neatly in their proper partitions

[10:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
HTML5 as a platform

[10:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
which involves two syntaxes, a language, and APIs for that language

[10:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
splitting the API from the language is artificial and just leads to ambiguities

[10:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
just look at DOM2 HTML

[10:12:03.0000] <Hixie>
the spec was originally called Web Applications 1.0, which is probably a more accurate name

[10:12:04.0000] <dglazkov>
right

[10:13:00.0000] <dglazkov>
what's wrong with DOM2?

[10:14:00.0000] <dglazkov>
what I see is a lot of tension on public-html between people who came to work on the format and people who came to work on the APIS

[10:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
look at the definition of things in DOM2 HTML and then compare them to the detail we have in HTML5

[10:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
the DOM2 HTML and HTML4 specs were written by groups of people who didn't want to write markup languages and didn't want to write APIs, respectively

[10:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
and we ended up with poor APIs and a poor markup language

[10:16:01.0000] <Hixie>
the two absolutely have to be designed in tandem

[10:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hey y'all

[10:18:01.0000] <alp>
heya othermaciej

[10:18:02.0000] <Lachy_>
hi

[10:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
to be effective for applications, HTML5 has to include a rich API

[10:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
much of the API is tied to the markup

[10:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the idea of separating them does not make sense

[10:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
and the charter requires us to do both

[10:19:04.0000] <othermaciej>
so I don't think it is even really worth thinking about

[10:20:00.0000] <Lachy_>
/me challenges those who think APIs should be specified in a separate spec from markup, to explain how they would even consider doing that for video, audio and canvas

[10:21:00.0000] <dglazkov>
ok, how does Web API WG fit into this, then?

[10:21:01.0000] <Lachy_>
they work together with us where appropriate

[10:21:02.0000] <dglazkov>
but.. aren't they an attempt to do exactly what you're advocating not to do?

[10:21:03.0000] <Lachy_>
in fact, we share some of the same members and some web api specs have been taken from older versions of HTML5 spec

[10:22:00.0000] <Lachy_>
dglazkov, not all APIs need to be specified with markup

[10:22:01.0000] <Lachy_>
some APIs aren't related to specific markup at all

[10:22:02.0000] <Lachy_>
like XHR or Window

[10:22:03.0000] <dglazkov>
like client-side storage spec?

[10:23:00.0000] <Lachy_>
maybe, but there's also the problem of finding competent editors in webapi to do it

[10:25:00.0000] <dglazkov>
ah..

[10:26:00.0000] <dglazkov>
maybe they can borrow a certain part of Hixie's brain? :)

[10:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't have the bandwidth to work on two specs

[10:27:01.0000] <Lachy_>
there's another advantage with doing it within the HTML spec though. a lot more people will review it there

[10:27:02.0000] <dglazkov>
definitely true, Lachy_

[10:31:00.0000] <dglazkov>
thanks for the primer, folks.

[12:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me summons othermaciej

[12:57:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me watches othermaciej appear from a lantern

[12:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(slowly)

[12:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
woot, it worked

[12:59:01.0000] <gsnedders>
:D

[13:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: so, what's wrong with ES ed 3 proposals? I need technical details to do my mojo here.

[13:02:00.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, apparently there are some problems with it degrading gracefully in current implemnetations

[13:03:00.0000] <gavin__>
what ES ed 3 proposals? do you mean ed 4?

[13:03:01.0000] <Lachy_>
I don't know much though, I just spoke to him about it briefly earlier and that's what othermaciej said

[13:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
er right, ed 4

[13:03:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I'm about to send a review of the language overview whitepaper

[13:03:04.0000] <Hixie>
ok cool

[13:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I am still trying to figure out all the technical issues worth pursuing

[13:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the ones that worry me are:

[13:04:02.0000] <roc>
http://www.ecmascript.org/es4/spec/incompatibilities.pdf for what it's worth

[13:04:03.0000] <othermaciej>
1) does not address compatibility from the "degrades gracefully" perspective

[13:04:04.0000] <othermaciej>
(easily fixable, I will make a concrete proposal)

[13:04:05.0000] <othermaciej>
2) slightly excessive in feature additions, some seem redundant

[13:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(unneeded features are bad for developers, bad for interop, and bad for small devices)

[13:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
3) unclear if it will hurt or improve performance in online implementations (I think this can probably be determined better with some experimentation and maybe some modest spec changes)

[13:05:02.0000] <othermaciej>
mainly I am worried about wether Brendan will be open to change proposals at all, since he seems to be in defensive mode

[13:06:00.0000] <gavin>
I'm sure he will be open to concret change proposals

[13:06:01.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, I am going to turn this into real specific points

[13:06:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and proposals

[13:06:03.0000] <othermaciej>
and we'll see what happens

[13:06:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I do think the objections so far have not been concrete enough

[13:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, I'm gonna go back to typing in my margin comments on the whitepaper

[13:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[13:07:02.0000] <gavin>
/me awaits othermaciej's comments with great anticipation :)

[13:08:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm happy to persue very specific technical concerns, i just don't have the bandwidth to figure out what they are myself

[13:08:01.0000] <othermaciej>
gavin: they are very rough so far - I almost literally typed in my notes in the margins from a printed copy I read on the plane

[13:08:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i look forward to further e-mail

[13:08:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: roger that

[13:09:00.0000] <gavin>
othermaciej: that's fine, I'm still looking forward to seeing them :)

[13:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: btw does ES4 define the semantics of 'replaceable' properties?

[13:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I don't think so - I am not sure ES4 would be the right level to define that in any case

[13:20:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: actually, I'm not up to speed on how exactly they act in various browsers

[13:20:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but it seems like they can be modelled at the ES4 level as an untyped read-write property even though the IDL makes them a typed read-only attribute

[13:20:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: investigating how replaceable properties (and shadowing a window property with var) is high on our agenda to investigate though

[13:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think ggaren is working on it

[13:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I will try to make sure the right thing ends up in the right spec (whether that is Bindings4DOM or ES4)

[13:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
,

[13:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
er, "k" even

[13:34:00.0000] <gsnedders>
similar is meaning really.

[13:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
so does ES4 require an explicit flag right now to enable it?

[13:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
as in, type="text/javascript;es4=1" or something?

[13:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
like e4x in firefox?

[13:39:03.0000] <Hixie>
cos the whole e4x=1 thing was clearly a failure...

[13:40:00.0000] <Lachy_>
if there needs to be some switch to turn on es4 features, it should be within the script itsself, not the mime type

[13:40:01.0000] <Philip`>
Firefox does all the JS1.8 features without an explicit flag, so I assume that's at least part of ES4

[13:41:00.0000] <gavin>
there's a proposal for a flag for certain incompatible features to be enabled

[13:41:01.0000] <gavin>
aiui

[13:41:02.0000] <Lachy_>
HTML5 fixed the issue with the required <script type=> in HTML4, it would be terrible if it were required anyway just to use es4

[13:41:03.0000] <gavin>
it's not required to use es4

[13:42:00.0000] <Lachy_>
AIUI, there are problems with hiding the new syntax features from current es3 implementations

[13:42:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, I'm wrong, FF doesn't do 'let' expressions without an explicit flag

[13:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
gavin: so how does the implementation know whether "yield" is a keyword or not?

[13:48:00.0000] <gavin>
I don't really know the details

[13:48:01.0000] <gavin>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=336376 was landed for Firefox 2, it allows reserved keywords as property names

[13:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
what i've heard from other people on the committee is that you'd need a flag like type=""

[13:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see how else you'd handle something like:   function () { var yield = 1; yield; }

[13:51:00.0000] <gavin>
I really don't know enough about the ES4 proposals to comment

[13:51:01.0000] <gavin>
http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=discussion:versioning and http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=proposals:versioning seem relevant

[13:53:00.0000] <gavin>
(I'm not sure whether those accurately reflect current thinking)

[13:53:01.0000] <gavin>
they seem to be fairly recent

[13:53:02.0000] <Hixie>
k

[13:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/demos/js/jsversion.html - oh, quite a few things need the flag, though quite another few don't

[13:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
gavin: giant email sent

[13:56:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: it requires a version=4 flag

[13:56:02.0000] <Hixie>
that sucks giant, and i mean giant, ass

[13:56:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Lachy_: agreed on in-script switches, I have a specific proposal for that comming semi-shortly

[13:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
that would basically make it impossible for cross-domain APIs to ever upgrade

[13:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
brb, cycling to the other building

[13:57:02.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: basically you have to write your script twice if you want to use ES4 features and still work in ES3 browsers

[14:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: that's not gonna fly

[14:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: what's not gonna fly? the Big Switch model of compatibility?

[14:06:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I agree that it won't fly and have told Brendan that in so many words on multiple occasions

[14:06:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: yes

[14:06:02.0000] <Hixie>
e4x showed that

[14:06:03.0000] <Hixie>
though the lack of easy conversion to/from DOM nodes also killed that

[14:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
E4X almost entirely works without any switch, so that doesn't seem relevant to its success

[14:12:00.0000] <roc>
I don't think we can draw any conclusions from E4X

[14:12:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: was the DOM integration problem a spec problem or an impl problem?

[14:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
impl

[15:30:00.0000] <marl>
heya

[15:30:01.0000] <marl>
those web applications include things like gmail?

[15:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
yup

[15:36:00.0000] <marl>
Hixie: is this related to that 'web 2.0' ?

[15:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i guess

[15:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what web 2.0 is

[15:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
web 2.0 should be rescinded, we need to fix all of the compat issues in web 2.1

[15:40:00.0000] <roc>
heh

[15:41:00.0000] <roc>
of course some people think that. "Why are you releasing new features when you haven't fixed all the bugs yet"

[15:42:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yes, that is a charmingly naiive point of view

[15:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
othermaciej: Didn't you get the SP yet?

[15:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
SP?


2007-11-15
[16:01:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Web 2.0 Service Pack 1

[16:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh I see

[16:21:00.0000] <marl>
Dashiva: what is this web 2.0 service pack?

[16:21:01.0000] <Dashiva>
This: http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/UnNews:Web_2.0_Service_Pack_1_to_be_released

[16:23:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's a joke

[22:38:00.0000] <yod>
karl, tu as toujours ton script pour recuperer tout ce que tu as fait sur cvs?

[22:39:00.0000] <yod>
aha, wrong window, sorry

[06:46:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yay! i catched up with whatwg mail. now i can dive into public-html (227 mails)

[06:46:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
zcorpan - enjoy

[08:47:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oooook. i think it's time to skip the rest of the ping thread

[08:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
please tell me if there's a message in that thread i should have read

[08:48:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me calls it a day

[13:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me adds two more steps to his spec generating pipeline

[13:31:01.0000] <Hixie>
it now runs the w3c pubrules checker (which includes a validator step) every time i generate the spec

[13:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
output is here: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/pubrules-conformance-report.html

[13:35:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
hmm. i somehow have troubles contacting mark pilgrim :(

[13:39:00.0000] <markp>
mitsuhiko: you rang?

[13:40:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
ah. yes i did :)

[13:40:01.0000] <mitsuhiko>
markp: are there plans to make the sanitizing in the feedparser optional?

[13:40:02.0000] <mitsuhiko>
i don't need it because i have to preprocess it with html5lib anyways

[13:41:00.0000] <markp>
that's a good question

[13:41:01.0000] <markp>
there has been some rumbling about replacing large chunks of feedparser with html5lib

[13:42:00.0000] <markp>
esp. now that it has sanitizing built-in

[13:42:01.0000] <mitsuhiko>
(thoug i'm using a subclass of the sinitizing filter that removes script tags instead of escaping it)

[13:42:02.0000] <mitsuhiko>
because there are countless blogs with those annoying digg buttons

[13:45:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
markp: oh. and kudos, the lib rocks :)

[13:56:00.0000] <jgraham>
mitsuhiko: If you want to create a patch for making the sanitizer optionally discard rather than escape, it would be welcome

[13:58:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
jgraham: sure

[13:59:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
jgraham: can filters assume that they operate on a valid stream?

[13:59:01.0000] <mitsuhiko>
say, that for each StartTag an EndTag is emitted?

[14:02:00.0000] <jgraham>
mitsuhiko: It depends where you're putting the filter. If it is a filter that operates on a treewalker stream, then yes, modulo void elements e.g. <img>. If you're operating at the tokenizer-treebuilder boundary (like the existing sanitizer can), no.

[14:14:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
jgraham: i must admit that i was too lazy to read it up and it worked for my planet: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/10696

[14:15:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
don't know if it's useful for anyone else out there

/me has now catched up with public-html mail

[08:32:00.0000] <dglazkov>
who can help me with a question on SQLResultSetRowList

[08:33:00.0000] <dglazkov>
this "item(in...)" is a short-hand for indexer, right?

[08:33:01.0000] <dglazkov>
in other words, this should work

[08:34:00.0000] <dglazkov>
tx.executeSql(..., function(tx, rs) { var row = rs.rows[0]; })

[09:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
zcorpan: is what the spec says compatible with firefox for events in designMode?

[09:21:01.0000] <Hixie>
(and by the way, the past tense of "to catch" is "caught". don't ask me why.)

[09:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
dglazkov: yes

[09:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
dglazkov: that will be specified more thoroughly in due course

[09:26:00.0000] <dglazkov>
excellent


2007-11-17
[18:12:00.0000] <dglazkov>
ok, another SQL spec question..

[18:13:00.0000] <dglazkov>
the spec doesn't mention what I should do about multiple transactions:

[18:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
in what regard?

[18:14:01.0000] <dglazkov>
db.transaction(function() { ... }); // 1

[18:14:02.0000] <dglazkov>
db.transaction(function() { ... }); //2

[18:14:03.0000] <dglazkov>
are these queued up? is 2 blocked until 1 is finished

[18:15:00.0000] <dglazkov>
since both tx callbacks are executed asynchronously, what's the expected behavior

[18:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the locking isn't specified in detail, but they have to follow the lock requirements

[18:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
if both only do reads they can likely execute in parallel

[18:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
if they write, then they will get serialized

[18:41:00.0000] <dglazkov>
sorry, had to restart ff

[18:42:00.0000] <dglazkov>
so, in SQLite-speak, you're saying that transaction is BEGIN DEFERRED, not BEGIN IMMEDIATE

[18:43:00.0000] <dglazkov>
because BEGIN IMMEDIATE won't let another BEGIN IMMEDIATE happen until it's committed

[18:48:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well I don't know, the spec is unclear on this

[18:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
we've been discussing what it should be

[18:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
dglazkov: are you looking to implement the spec?

[18:49:01.0000] <dglazkov>
I think I am just going to go with BEGIN IMMEDIATE for now and sort it out later

[18:49:02.0000] <dglazkov>
yes, I already have it pretty much working

[18:49:03.0000] <othermaciej>
cool

[18:49:04.0000] <othermaciej>
native implementation for Gecko?

[08:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
anyone know where the demo this is a screenshot of is? http://annevankesteren.nl/2006/05/canvas-3d

[08:22:01.0000] <zcorpan>
(is that correct english?)

[08:29:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or other 3d canvas demos

[08:29:01.0000] <zcorpan>
found this http://files.myopera.com/grafio/files/demo1.html

[08:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is the experimental build already available for Mac PPC?

[08:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
don't think so

[08:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://www.svgopen.org/papers/abstract3/wowslides+demos.zip has a 3d canvas demo

[09:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/demos/canvas/opera-3d/textured-cube.html has a totally exciting cube demo

[09:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
apart from the 3d snake game, all demos are a rotating cube, it seems :)

[09:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not really sure what else you could do with it :-p

[09:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
heh

[09:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
As far as I can tell, it can't do anything like http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/3d.html since there's no lighting

[09:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
and the addVertex(...) API doesn't scale very well when vertexes have coordinates, optionally texture coordinates, optionally normals, and optionally whatever else is added later

[11:04:00.0000] <Philip`>

[02:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: "Element a from namespace http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml requires significant inline content but did not have any." -- shouldn't this be "Element a requires ..." (with a link)?

[03:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: is the "(Suppressing further error errors from this subtree.)" intended to reduce errors for bimorphic content models?

[03:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
afaict it emits further errors

[03:03:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or is it just chilren of that element?

[03:04:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ah yes, that makes sense

?

[16:21:00.0000] <alp>
othermaciej: xaml is just the markup, but afaik wpf is entirely retained mode

[16:22:00.0000] <othermaciej>
looks like it to me too, so far as I can tell from the docs

[16:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
aha, there is direct rendering

is the consensus on geolocation currently use navigator.getGeolocation()? i'm going to hack up support for this in the n810 tablet browser

[16:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
no idea

maybe someone who was involved in this thread knows, http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-February/009626.html

[16:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know if anyone implements it, might be worth asking Opera and/or Nokia folks

[18:19:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: have you been following the discussions in m.d.a.firefox about <a ping>?

[18:19:01.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_thread/thread/a8469770c8f9fe52

[18:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was aware of the discussion but haven't followed it

[18:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
anything i should be aware of?

[18:48:00.0000] <roc>
"UI for pings sucks"

[18:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you could do a status bar effect, that would be sufficient for the sort of person likely to be a privacy weenie and unobstrusive otherwise

[18:53:01.0000] <othermaciej>
that's what I would do if I wanted to implement ping

[18:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(if you have the status bar off, or don't look, you don't even know where the link will go, so why would you care that it pings an extra URL?)

[18:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah i didn't understand the arguments against the status bar thing

[18:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't see how it sucks any more than the link UI in the first place

[19:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I did not read the arguments in detail, that's just my immediate thought

[19:02:01.0000] <roc>
a privacy weenie might as well just disable ping altogether

[19:03:00.0000] <roc>
maybe the sort of person exists who obsessively checks the status bar every time they click on a link

[19:03:01.0000] <roc>
I'd like to see an existence proof before implementing UI for them

[19:03:02.0000] <roc>
(and in Firefox of course they could have their own special extension)

[19:04:00.0000] <othermaciej>
my conclusion is mostly that "ping" is not useful enough to implement

[19:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the main benefit is that it potentially gives users more info

[19:04:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but most users won't care

[19:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: I tend to look at the status bar before clicking blog links, though out of curiosity more than anything

[19:05:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't always look though

[19:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess <a ping> has the side effect that if sites use it, you get to see the real target URL in mouseover feedback

[19:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not the tracking redirect URL

[19:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the question is whether any sites will use it

[19:08:01.0000] <roc>
I think it's useful to implement. a) it's supposed to yield faster navigation than going through a redirect, b) you get the real URL on "copy link location" instead of some redirect URL, c) if sites start using it then people can disable it to get privacy benefits

[19:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think all of those are contingent on "if sites start using it"

[19:09:01.0000] <roc>
most features are :-)

[19:09:02.0000] <othermaciej>
the more people disable it, the less sites are inclined to use it

[19:09:03.0000] <othermaciej>
well, some can give significant benefits only if relatively few sites use it

[19:10:00.0000] <roc>
if we ship it enabled, almost no-one will disable it

[19:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but certainly every feature should consider transition costs to using it

[19:10:02.0000] <jwalden>
get Google to promise to use it, and maybe I'd go for it

[19:10:03.0000] <othermaciej>
some sites get upset that Firefox lets you do ad blocking through extensions (not even the default UI)

[19:10:04.0000] <othermaciej>
some sites have crazy counter-measures for pop-up blocking even though it is not on by default for the majority of browser users

[19:10:05.0000] <roc>
yes, well, some sites are run by morons

[19:10:06.0000] <jwalden>
(instead of their current sucky redirect-URL-that-you-can-copy approach)

[19:11:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and "ping" has no story for fallback in browsers that don't support it

[19:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
unlike things like <canvas> and <video>

[19:11:02.0000] <roc>
I "heard" that major search sites are keen on using <ping> because of the usability speedup from cutting the redirect out of the equation

[19:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
for ad links?

[19:12:01.0000] <roc>
the fallback story for <canvas> and <video> is in reality quite weak.

[19:12:02.0000] <jwalden>
tangible benefits for the user are the only way to sell it -- that's the one I see working

[19:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I doubt search engines would use it for ad links, since then they would undercount the number of ad hits

[19:12:04.0000] <othermaciej>
which loses them money

[19:12:05.0000] <roc>
I think the idea was to track which search results users click on

[19:12:06.0000] <othermaciej>
(until most browsers support it, they would *vastly* undercut the number of ad hits)

[19:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
ah

[19:14:00.0000] <jwalden>
depends how cheap user-agent-specific behavior is -- probably pretty cheap

[19:15:00.0000] <othermaciej>
might be useful for cases where lossy data is acceptable

[19:15:01.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, I think either no UI or status bar indicator would be a reasonable form of the feature

[19:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I would lean towards status indicator since you lose the ability to see that the URL is some weird redirect thing with <a ping> but I don't think that is a very strong argument

[19:17:00.0000] <roc>
I think sites have to care enough to UA-sniff. Hopefully some will. We'll have to ship it and hope, like a lot of other things we've done

[19:17:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I specifically don't think the UI for ping needs to be any better than the UI for seeing where a link will go before clicking it

[19:17:02.0000] <othermaciej>
<video> could be used without UA-sniffing

[19:17:03.0000] <othermaciej>
and UA-sniffing is a bad practice

[19:18:00.0000] <othermaciej>
any fallback story that depends on UA sniffing is weak

[19:19:00.0000] <roc>
got a better idea for this situation?

[19:19:01.0000] <roc>
maybe standardize a redirect URL format and have "ping" automatically re-directize the URL :-)

[19:19:02.0000] <roc>
er

[19:19:03.0000] <roc>
un-redirectize

[19:29:00.0000] <jwalden>
redirect://site.com/redirector?http://url-to-visit/

[19:29:01.0000] <jwalden>
so basically feed: all over again

[19:30:00.0000] <roc>
no

[19:30:01.0000] <jwalden>
er

[19:30:02.0000] <jwalden>
yeah, that's wrong

[19:30:03.0000] <jwalden>
blah, this hurts my head

[19:32:00.0000] <roc>
more like <a ping="pings.example.com" href="http://pings.example.com/redirect?http://mozilla.org"> and we guarantee that "ping", if supported, will strip off everything up to and including the first ?

[19:32:01.0000] <roc>
well, that's kinda wrong but that's the idea

[19:32:02.0000] <roc>
but that's actually a stupid idea

[19:32:03.0000] <roc>
so never mind

[19:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: ah, interesting

[19:35:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: that certainly has better fallback behavior, though still not sure that would drive more adoption

[19:35:01.0000] <othermaciej>
this is really a case where we need to ask content authors who do tracking what they think

[19:37:00.0000] <roc>
my understanding is that this was driven by content authors

[19:38:00.0000] <roc>
the problem with my idea is that it leaves the HREF busted

[19:38:01.0000] <roc>
for "Copy Link Location" etc

[19:39:00.0000] <roc>
oh, I suppose that for "ping"-supporting browsers, Copy Link Location and other UI features could auto-strip the URL

[19:39:01.0000] <roc>
as well

[19:40:00.0000] <roc>
adds complexity :-(

[19:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah ping="" was basically designed by google to handle the problems that google has with the currently available options (and believe me, google is an _expert_ at how to do this kind of stuff)

[19:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
the biggest problems with that state of the art, from google's point of view, are lack of user privacy options (disabling), redirect slowness (which can be avoided with some browsers by abusing some bugs, but that sucks), and the transparency issue

[20:28:00.0000] <jruderman>
i hadn't thought of the "which search results did the user click?" use case, but it makes a lot of sense, given that google has been trying to do that for a while (presumably to improve search results rather than for any nefarious purpose)

[20:30:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: i thought beltzner's posts in that thread were especially good

[20:30:01.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: do you have a suggestion for what the enable-ping checkbox label should be? :)

[20:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
what did beltzner propose?

[20:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
[x] Allow sites to track which links you click on

[20:33:00.0000] <roc>
the problem with that is that even when you clear it, sites can still track which links you click on

[20:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
sites can still animate images even when animated images are disabled

[20:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
so what?

[20:35:02.0000] <roc>
this is true

[20:36:00.0000] <roc>
but we don't seem to have that pref in Firefox anymore :-)

[20:37:00.0000] <roc>
so I guess you need to think of another example

[20:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
cookies and flash

[20:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
but my point is just that the pref doesn't have to be pedantically correcty

[20:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
correct, even

[20:38:02.0000] <roc>
I guess the problem is that it's not even close

[20:38:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's close enough

[20:38:04.0000] <roc>
since at least initially clicking that box will have no effect on anything

[20:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
[ ] Enable out-of-band declarative link tracking

[20:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
s/link/click/

[20:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
but personally i think "Allow sites to track which links you click on" is fine

[20:40:01.0000] <roc>
[ ] I trust Google

[20:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
or that

[20:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
though actually that's more misleading, imho

[20:41:00.0000] <roc>
I was joking, sorry

[20:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
since if you didn't trust google to use the track data ethically, you wouldn't trust google to use ping= in the first place

[20:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
oh i know :-)

[20:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
but even as a joke i don't think it works :-)

[21:06:00.0000] <jwalden>
[ ] Whatever

[21:06:01.0000] <jwalden>
none of the proposed phrasings are clear enough to work without needing to refer to help documentation

[21:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
"Allow sites to track which links you click on" seems reasonable, although it makes the feature sound scarier than it is

[22:28:00.0000] <mpt>
s/Allow (.+) to (.+)/Let \1 \2/g

[22:29:00.0000] <mpt>
But it still fails the "...or what?" test

[22:29:01.0000] <mpt>
i.e. you can't tell, by reading it, why you'd want to check it

[22:30:00.0000] <mpt>
(or uncheck it)

[22:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
mpt: how would you phrase it?

[22:46:00.0000] <jwalden>
accuracy, clarity, non-tinfoil-hat-inducing -- pick two

[22:46:01.0000] <jwalden>
actually, make that second understandability

[22:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
to be honest i would target the pref at the tinfoil induced

[22:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
they're the only ones who will really care, based on my experience

[22:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
for all the cries about privacy -- and i agree that privacy is important -- few users seem to actually care in practice

[22:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's those who do care who should be able to turn it off easily

[23:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if I were designing the UI for Safari my recommendation would probably be no pref setting at all

[23:29:00.0000] <mpt>
Hixie, I don't think there's any good way to phrase it without referring to the specific HTML attribute (and therefore delving into geekitude), because it controls only one of the ways by which a Web site can track your clicks

[23:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
mpt: possibly

[23:29:02.0000] <mpt>
To go back to your animated images example, in my dream browser that checkbox would control GIFs *and* Flash *and* JavaScript src-changes

[23:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
mpt: and <canvas> painting and DOM manipulation on a timer and meta refresh in an iframe?

[23:30:01.0000] <mpt>
probably :-)

[23:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: unfortunately that removes one of the main reasons to do it (though not all of the reasons that benefit the user, it must be said)

[23:31:00.0000] <Hixie>
mpt: that would be a very confusing pref

[23:31:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: I don't think "privacy extremists can turn it off" is a very good reason to do anything

[23:31:02.0000] <othermaciej>
at least, so far as Apple products go

[23:31:03.0000] <Hixie>
fair enough

[23:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I do think 

[23:32:01.0000] <othermaciej>
"you can see the real link target"

[23:32:02.0000] <othermaciej>
is a good reason

[23:32:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(to the extent that seeing the link target is interesting at all, which it is somewhat)

[23:32:04.0000] <mpt>
/me realizes he's not saying anything he didn't already say in October 2005

[23:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think the reduced latency is the second most important reason (the first being the "option for privacy extremists"), at least from google's perspective

[23:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
from google's perspective, can't it have its own pref?

[23:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
(we already handle showing the right uri, by changing the uri at the last second when the user follows the link)

[23:34:02.0000] <Hixie>
well, the target audience likely isn't logged in

[23:34:03.0000] <othermaciej>
(though I guess privacy extremists wouldn't want to let google set a cookie)

[23:34:04.0000] <Hixie>
right

[23:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
there are a number of reasons to do this beyond just the privacy angle, of course

[23:35:01.0000] <Hixie>
latency, ui, reliability, etc

[23:35:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it might be reasonable to restrict it only to be able to ping the host that served the page

[23:36:00.0000] <Hixie>
that actually fails to address some of google's most important occurances of click tracking

[23:36:01.0000] <Hixie>
sadly

[23:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
similar to the default cookie policy in Safari

[23:36:03.0000] <Hixie>
(e.g. adsense)

[23:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
would adsense be ok with a form of click tracking that you could turn off?

[23:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
users come above profits

[23:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
so yes

[23:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
(obviously, that might change if a browser defaulted to disabling it)

[23:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
frankly we have bigger problems with false reported hits than false unreported hits

[23:39:02.0000] <othermaciej>
so you wouldn't want a browser to ship with the "ping every click counter [ 10 ] times" pref?

[23:40:00.0000] <mpt>
Even assuming this was a good idea, it looks to me like it would be a tragedy of the commons

[23:40:01.0000] <othermaciej>
tragedy of the commons?

[23:40:02.0000] <mpt>
The first browser to choose to default to ignoring ping= would be (slightly) faster than those that observed it

[23:41:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what's the scarce resource with no allocation policy in this case?

[23:41:01.0000] <mpt>
So other browsers would eventually ignore it to match, driving site authors back to using server-side redirects.

[23:41:02.0000] <othermaciej>
what you describe is (perhaps) a race to the bottom, not a tragedy of the commons

[23:41:03.0000] <othermaciej>
however, I don't think ping would be a significant perf hit

[23:41:04.0000] <othermaciej>
as long as you prioritize it lower than actual I/O for the page you are loading

[23:42:00.0000] <mpt>
The scarce resource being bandwidth

[23:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
actually the great thing about ping="" is it can be implemented in a way that totally avoids any performance hit

[23:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
which is, as noted above, the second most important reason google is interested in it

[23:43:00.0000] <mpt>
Send the ping once everything else has finished transferring?

[23:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: and yeah, such a pref would be a quick way to kill the feature from our point of view :-)

[23:43:02.0000] <mpt>
... in all browser windows?

[23:43:03.0000] <Hixie>
mpt: right

[23:43:04.0000] <mpt>
... and other Internet-using software you happen to have open?

[23:43:05.0000] <Hixie>
mpt: four TCP packets aren't even going to be a blip on the radar if you wait for a lull

[23:43:06.0000] <mpt>
true

[23:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's not the bandwidth that kills you in the redirect case, it's the latency

[23:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
and that's all you need (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK, HTTP POST, close connection)

[23:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[23:44:03.0000] <othermaciej>
/me loves saying "it's not the bandwidth, it's the latency"

[23:44:04.0000] <Hixie>
latency is all i care about these days

[23:44:05.0000] <Hixie>
bandwidth only matters when you're trying to watch video

[23:44:06.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems like the software engineer equivalent of "I'm a doctor, dammit, not an engineer"

[23:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[23:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
bandwidth also matters when you are on EDGE and want to look at web sites

[23:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
i avoid such networks :-)

[23:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't have any hardware even capable of connecting to such lame networks

[23:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[23:46:02.0000] <othermaciej>
it certainly seems like such networks are on the way out

[23:46:03.0000] <othermaciej>
but latency is still a killer

[23:46:04.0000] <othermaciej>
this is why <script src=""> is worse than <img> for page loading performance

[23:47:00.0000] <othermaciej>
also why the http connection limit and the fact that pipelining is not practically usable taken together are bad

[23:47:01.0000] <othermaciej>
maybe sites should have some way to opt out of the connection limit

[23:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
<script async> baby

[23:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
the http limit is a pain, i agree

[23:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure what to do about it

[23:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
there are sites that would quickly DOS themselves if it wasn't for that limit

[23:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
(e.g. flickr)

[23:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
people ship Firefox extensions and Safari haxies to violate the connection limit for allegedly faster network perf

[23:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
not sure if it works

[23:54:02.0000] <othermaciej>
another useful thing would be a reliable way for the site to report that it can support pipelining correctly

[23:54:03.0000] <othermaciej>
wait, that wouldn't work

[23:54:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I just remembered the reason we don't enable it is that apprently some proxies break in horrible ways

[23:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
so an end-to-end header wouldn't help

[23:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
can't remember if they are normal http proxies or transparent proxies

[23:55:02.0000] <othermaciej>
or indeed if they still exist

[23:55:03.0000] <othermaciej>
would flickr really blow up without the limit? (I have no idea)

[23:55:04.0000] <Hixie>
proxies are, from what i've heard in conversations with pretty much everyone who has ever deployed real end user software on the web, the worst pieces of software on the web

[23:56:00.0000] <othermaciej>
seems like with enough users, the connection limit won't actually reduce connections made per second

[23:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've heard horrible stories about proxies

[23:56:02.0000] <othermaciej>
assuming constant time to serve a request

[23:56:03.0000] <Hixie>
if you have N users, and you remove the connection limit on a page with 20 images, you'll got from 2N connections to 21N+ connections

[23:56:04.0000] <othermaciej>
no, I think I am doing bad math there

[23:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
s/got/go/

[23:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think max number of connections used would give the best perf, I doubt network stacks would schedule it that way

[23:58:00.0000] <othermaciej>
would probably just use more for data more likely to be latency-sensitive

[23:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
if you're selfish, and have ample bandwidth, why wouldn't opening as many connections as possible win?

[23:58:02.0000] <othermaciej>
and use some reasonable limit, like 4 or something, for images

[23:58:03.0000] <othermaciej>
pipelining would be better though

[23:58:04.0000] <Hixie>
what might help is to drop the connection limit for specific things, like <event-source> or TCPConnection (or whatever replaces them)

[23:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I guess it depends on how many it takes to saturate your bandwidth

[23:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
once you've filled bandwidth adding more is bad

[23:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[23:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
and on dial-up that might be a concern

[23:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
and maybe even on low-end DSL or cable

[23:59:05.0000] <Hixie>
but there comes a point where you really aren't going to notice

[00:00:00.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i can tell

[00:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, i'm a doctor, not an engineer

[00:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
so...

[00:00:03.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[00:00:04.0000] <Hixie>
i should sleep

[00:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
nn

[00:10:00.0000] <roc>
there's got to be a way to detect bad proxies

[00:10:01.0000] <roc>
like maybe we set up a special test site

[00:11:00.0000] <roc>
and when pipelining is enabled in the browser, every time the user's IP address changes, we send a test HTTP pipelining transaction to the test site

[00:43:00.0000] <othermaciej>
roc: proxy config can change w/o IP change

[00:43:01.0000] <othermaciej>
generally that is detectable

[00:43:02.0000] <othermaciej>
dunno about the transparent proxy case

[00:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the problem really is that in the failure case it's not always obvious at a machine level that the response is currupted

[00:51:00.0000] <roc>
yeah

[00:51:01.0000] <roc>
someone can always bring up a transparent proxy that causes pipelining requests to be mangled/hang

[00:52:00.0000] <roc>
but we have to figure out a way to unbreak this part of the Web

[00:52:01.0000] <roc>
one day...

[01:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it is a problem worth solving, but pretty tough

[01:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
ironically something like Google Web Accelerator could solve it

[01:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
though perhaps it also obviates the need for it

[01:08:00.0000] <Hixie>

[02:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
where do I find the allowed whitespace positions in mime types?

[02:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
surely text / plain is not allowed?

[02:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i remember this being discussed here (or in #html-wg) a few weeks ago

[02:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I figured that parsing media queries manually was a mistake, so I'm going with ANTLR for mime types

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I haven't figured out yet how to get human-friendly error messages out of ANTLR, though

[02:21:00.0000] <kfish>
hsivonen, do you mean the allowed whitespace in something like "text/plain; charset=us-ascii (Plain text)" ?

[02:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
kfish: yes. where is it defined that WS around the semicolon is OK but around the slash (presumably) not?

[02:22:01.0000] <kfish>
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt

[02:22:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I didn't find it there

[02:22:03.0000] <kfish>
section 5.1 has the bnf

[02:23:00.0000] <kfish>
content := "Content-Type" ":" type "/" subtype

[02:23:01.0000] <kfish>
where type and subtype are basically made of token

[02:23:02.0000] <kfish>
token := 1*<any (US-ASCII) CHAR except SPACE, CTLs,

[02:23:03.0000] <kfish>
                 or tspecials>

[02:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so where does it say that space after the semicolon is OK?

[02:24:01.0000] <hsivonen>
are where does it say that inter-token WS is always OK?

[02:24:02.0000] <hsivonen>
s/are/or/

[02:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt - "implied *LWS" "Except where noted otherwise, linear white space (LWS) can be included between any two adjacent words (token or quoted-string), and between adjacent words and separators, without changing the interpretation of a field."

[02:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: that would allow white space like this "text   / html"

[02:32:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: is that actually supported?

[02:32:02.0000] <kfish>
and rfc822 explicitly allowed spaces around the @ in email addresses

[02:32:03.0000] <hsivonen>
kfish: scary

[02:33:00.0000] <kfish>
seems to have been cleaned up in 2822

[02:33:01.0000] <kfish>
(and newlines, i might add ...)

[02:33:02.0000] <Philip`>
data:text / html,<b>Test  suggests maybe in Firefox

[02:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
In addition, comments are allowed in accordance with RFC 822 rules for structured header fields.

[02:39:01.0000] <hsivonen>
argh. who came up with the idea of allowing comments in headers?

[02:41:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://philip.html5.org/demos/http/content-type/text-html vs http://philip.html5.org/demos/http/content-type/text-plain suggests IE/Firefox/Opera don't accept "text / html"

[02:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay

[02:42:01.0000] <hsivonen>
time to send email I guess

[02:42:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Not sure why data:text / html,... works in Firefox)

[03:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
were these RFCs written before there was a requirement for "rough consensus and *running code*" at the IETF?

[03:07:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I mean: one would think that actual implementors would have revolted over some of the gratuitous complexity

[03:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. with RFC 2616 media type simplification rules, ANTLR looks like an overkill again...

[04:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is unhappy due to time wasted over RFC 2045 considering that RFC 2616 is much better on the media type point

[04:01:00.0000] <annevk>
you could just ignore it

[04:01:01.0000] <annevk>
it's not even a comment on the intro doc

[04:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
annevk: I didn't mean Julian's comments. I meant my efforts to implement conformance checking for attributes that take a MIME type optionally with parameters

[04:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm rather unhappy that I followed the normative reference to the MIME RFC rathole instead of realizing right away that I should have known to read RFC 2616 instead

[04:51:00.0000] <annevk>
hsivonen, ah, I see

[04:51:01.0000] <annevk>
somehow we need to solve the HTTP mess...

[04:51:02.0000] <annevk>
but I guess that's simply said...

[08:10:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`, hsivonen: Implied LWS is explicitly disallowed around the slash in MIME types

[08:11:00.0000] <Philip`>
gsnedders: I think the problem was it isn't explicit in RFC2045

[08:11:01.0000] <gsnedders>
ah

[08:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: sorry about out of date references -- they're the best references i am aware of when i make the reference, but i have trouble keeping track of what's what, that's why i haven't updated them and why the section doesn't yet exist

[08:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
if i don't have a references section, people can't claim they're out of date

[08:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
at least that was the theory

[08:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
in practice people complain about as much, i just ignore them more :-)

[09:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: yes

[09:42:00.0000] <Lachy_>
gsnedders, ?

[10:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Lachy: accessing your site

[12:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me wonders if HTTP implementations really support backslash escaping control chararacters...

[13:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Mozilla in places just keeps the slashes and everything until double quote not preceeded by a slash

[13:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: is there a bug filed? what do other browsers do?

[13:25:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: dunno.

[13:25:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: I've had so little time to reverse engineer such things

[13:26:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: Mozilla doesn't have a unified place for decoding quoted-string, and does it all over the place

[14:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish i understood what karl was trying to say in his last e-mail

[15:03:00.0000] <Lachy_>
Hixie, I think he's trying to say that determining the demand for a feature is subjective and depends upon who is asked

[15:05:00.0000] <jgraham_>
I can't say it makes a lot of sense to me, but Lachy_'s interpretation seems plausible

[15:10:00.0000] <gavin>
I interpreted it as "there are features currently in the spec for which I haven't seen requests on the mailing lists"

[15:11:00.0000] <Lachy_>
that would be because most of the features in the spec were discussed on the whatwg list well before the htmlwg started

[15:11:01.0000] <Lachy_>
and also because demand for a feature can come from a lot more places than just the mailing list

[15:13:00.0000] <gavin>
yeah, I know

[15:13:01.0000] <gavin>
but his message gave me the impresion that he doesn't see it that way

[15:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
well, the former interpretation is a truism, so i doubt that's what he meant

[15:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
gavin's interpretation makes sense, but i'm not sure what karl expects me to do with it if that's what he meant

[15:16:00.0000] <Hixie>
since it's clear that public-html is far from the only source that we should look at

[15:16:01.0000] <jgraham>
I think the implication is that the spec has solicited input from a subset of its potential users and so is biased toward the desires of those people

[15:17:00.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: Can't you just ask? (what Karl meant)

[15:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
i haven't had good luck asking karl what he meant in the past

[15:18:01.0000] <webben_>
ah

[15:22:00.0000] <jgraham>
(in addition it seems to imply that the development has been on a "we go to some community and ask what they want out of html" model, which I don't think matches reality)

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
jgraham: the implication that the spec has solicited input only from a subset of its potential users (and so is biased) is true, of course

[15:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
not sure how to avoid that

[15:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyway

[15:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
it would de helpful if karl made it clearer in his e-mails what he desired from his e-mails

[15:26:00.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: Regardless of what Karl meant, I suppose the way to solicit input from lots of users is to simply ask different communities for input. I suspect the challenge would be translating such input into stuff that's in scope for HTML. But that doesn't mean it would be a worthless procedure.

[15:26:01.0000] <jgraham>
Hixie: Of course not all communities are equally easy to reach but the doors for feedback have always been open

[15:27:00.0000] <jgraham>
so in principle, any community can provide input

[15:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: right, that's what we've been doing for years

[15:28:00.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: Haven't most of these users been technical?

[15:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
many have, but by no means all

[15:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
most of html's target audience is technical, though, so that bias is to be expected

[15:29:00.0000] <webben_>
No. Most of HTML's target audience is technically illiterate. It's just that their use of HTML is mediated through applications.

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
i should rephrase

[15:29:02.0000] <webben_>
actually if you include stuff like blog comments, maybe even most HTML authors are technically illiterate

[15:29:03.0000] <Hixie>
most of web apps 1.0's target audience was technical

[15:29:04.0000] <webben_>
ah yes

[15:29:05.0000] <Hixie>
html5's primary goal is extending html to apply to web application authors

[15:29:06.0000] <Hixie>
who are technical

[15:30:00.0000] <jgraham>
There is a distinction to be made between HTML+DOM and content-that-happens-to-be-in-HTML

[15:31:00.0000] <jgraham>
HTML+DOM is mainly aimed at technical users (although hopefully with a very low barrier to entry)

[15:31:01.0000] <jgraham>
HTML content is aimed at everyone

[15:31:02.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: where do comments on blogger fit into that scheme

[15:32:00.0000] <webben_>
(Blogger allows markup like b and i)

[15:33:00.0000] <jgraham>
webben_: Essentially HTML is an implementation detail there; they could be using a GUI editor or markdown or anything else. But it happens that a subset of HTML-the-language is easy enough for many non-technical people to use

[15:33:01.0000] <jgraham>
Which is a good thing and I think we should consider those uses

[15:33:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure if non-technical users could express their needs in a very useful form

[15:33:03.0000] <jgraham>
by e.g. keeping <b> and <i>

[15:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
you'd have to use techniques like user testing to get useful data

[15:34:01.0000] <othermaciej>
or otherwise make indirect inferences from behavior patterns

[15:34:02.0000] <webben_>
othermaciej: That's possibly true. Maybe that's an essential part of soliciting input.

[15:34:03.0000] <Hixie>
(note that i have used input from usability studies on users of wysiwyg editors in drafting html5)

[15:35:00.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: That's good.

[15:42:00.0000] <webben_>
Does HTML5 have a document listing persona yet?

[15:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
persona?

[15:47:00.0000] <webben_>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personas

[15:48:00.0000] <webben_>
it was an idea raised early on in public-html somewhere ... at some point someone linked to the WAI personas

[15:48:01.0000] <webben_>
but that's only one aspect of HTML usership

[15:48:02.0000] <Hixie>
i do not believe anyone has written a document describing use cases from the point of view of fictious characters, no

[15:50:00.0000] <jgraham>
I always wonder about the value of such documents; it's hard to say if a fictional use case scenario corresponds to reality or not

[15:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone wants to write such a document, i'm certainly not opposed. the whatwg wiki is available as a place to put such discussions, if needed.

[15:51:01.0000] <webben_>
jgraham: That's true. But it's equally hard to say if a use case scenario considered in the abstract corresponds to reality or not.

[15:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
we don't tend to consider use cases in the abstract

[15:51:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I'm not sure personas are a useful abstraction for extremely widely deployed technical specifications

[15:51:04.0000] <Hixie>
for most features the use cases are derived straight from actual feedback

[15:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
they are most useful for end-user applications with a specialized but not monolithic target audience

[15:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. the offline stuff is derived straight from experience the Google Reader team had in developing an offline version of Google Reader

[15:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
(amongst other things)

[15:52:03.0000] <Hixie>
similarly, i took experience from the YouTube, Google Video, and (in the form of feedback and discussions) the Quicktime teams in writing the video section

[15:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
all of which is very much not abstract :-)

[15:54:00.0000] <webben_>
Does the HTML5 WG have a way by which your average Joe can send feedback?

[15:54:01.0000] <Hixie>
the html5 wg, or the whatwg?

[15:54:02.0000] <Hixie>
the whatwg has several

[15:54:03.0000] <webben_>
Or would they need to send it to WHATWG?

[15:54:04.0000] <webben_>
I'm talking about the HTML5 WG.

[15:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know that the w3c is really set up for getting feedback from random joe

[15:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose they could mail www-html⊙wo, i follow that

[15:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
public-html-comments⊙wo?

[15:55:03.0000] <Hixie>
oh, is that active?

[15:55:04.0000] <webben_>
Maybe the HTML WG homepage should say?

[15:55:05.0000] <Hixie>
maybe. tell the people in #htmlwg :-)

[15:55:06.0000] <Philip`>
It had two emails this month, so presumably it works

[15:55:07.0000] <Hixie>
(i don't have access to those pages, i don't think)

[15:55:08.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: ah

[15:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'd better make sure i'm subscribed

[15:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
Hmm, 14% of the list's posts is spam

[15:57:01.0000] <webben_>
I assume that's true of any W3C list that isn't looked after.

[15:57:02.0000] <Philip`>
or maybe it's 17%

[15:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-comments/ says September had 3 posts, but http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-comments/2007Sep/ shows two

[15:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders what a good way of faking |span { content: '' }| would be

[15:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
i suppose i have to use the evil text-indent trick

can anyone find a better 16x16 image on a microsoft-owned domain to represent IE than http://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico ?

[16:32:00.0000] <jruderman>
it needs to be hosted on a microsoft domain?

[16:38:00.0000] <jruderman>
does exploiting an XSS hole on a microsoft domain count?

[16:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd like it to be hosted on a microsoft domain

[16:38:02.0000] <Hixie>
what's your uri? :-)

[16:39:00.0000] <gavin>
does it have to be exactly 16x16?

[16:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
if possible

[16:41:00.0000] <gavin>
closes I've found so far is http://www.microsoft.com/enable/images/icons/windowsvista/ie7.jpg

[16:41:01.0000] <jruderman>
jpg wtf

[16:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535205.new(en-us,VS.85).gif

[16:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
oooh, that might work

[16:43:02.0000] <Philip`>
http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531207.ATTR_msext(en-us,VS.85).gif

[16:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
sweet, that first one is perfect

[16:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
thanks

[16:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
how about something for safari that's better than http://www.webkit.org/favicon.ico ?

[16:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
the problem with apple is that their "icons" have become photo-realistic multi-megapixel images at this point

[16:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
(ideally something on apple.com or webkit.org)

[16:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Your search - imagedoesnotexist - did not match any documents.  Results have been omitted at your request. If you'd like, you can <a href=/images?q=imagedoesnotexist&svnum=50&um=1&hl=en&safe=off&client=opera&rls=en&sa=G>repeat your search with the omitted results included</a>." [as the displayed text] - hmm, looks like someone escaped their HTML one time too many

[16:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
uri?

[16:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://images.google.com/images?imgsz=icon&q=imagedoesnotexist

[16:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess http://images.apple.com/safari/images/performance_safari20070611.gif is a bit too big

[16:55:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use <canvas> to resize it :-)

[16:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm using it from css

[16:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use <canvas> to resize it and toDataURL it into the CSS

[16:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
(except that doesn't work because of the security restrictions :-( )

[16:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i reported the overescaped html issue)

[16:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
(thanks)

[17:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me continues working on http://damowmow.com/playground/spec-annotation/001.html

[17:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
(which is what i need those icons for, btw)

[17:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
cute

[18:37:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: i think http://www.hixie.ch/tests/evil/page-loading/incremental/001.cgi?mime=text%2Fxml&delay=1&repeats=10 is busted

[19:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: could be

[19:27:00.0000] <Hixie>
jruderman: not sure how to fix it

[19:44:00.0000] <jruderman>
Hixie: :/

[19:44:01.0000] <jruderman>
not having that test makes me sad, because it was the testcase for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=368909

[19:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
can you tell what's going on?

[19:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
is it getting gzipped or something?

[19:45:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't really even know where to begin looking for a fix

[19:45:03.0000] <jruderman>
dunno. i tried using telnet last week but didn't get very far.

[19:47:00.0000] <jruderman>
ok, yeah, it's getting gzipped

[19:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
that's really weird

[19:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
gzip is disabled on this server in theory

[19:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i'm going through some sort of proxy or something

[22:33:00.0000] <Dan->
hello

[22:35:00.0000] <Dan->
any iphone software developers here?

[22:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Dan-: in what sense?

[22:50:00.0000] <Dan->
i want to start a new company

[22:51:00.0000] <Dan->
and need people to program web apps for the iphone

[23:15:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
andrioid ftw!

[23:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Dan-: you can probably look for anyone who is a good web developer then

[00:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://damowmow.com/playground/spec-annotation/001.html

[00:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone wants to fill in the XXX parts in http://damowmow.com/playground/spec-annotation/status.js -- be my guest :-)

[00:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
(in particular, the network object at the bottom)

[00:33:01.0000] <Hixie>
(see also http://damowmow.com/playground/spec-annotation/PROTOCOL )

[00:34:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Interesting. Using Javascript to automate compliance testing?

[00:35:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
No, it does something else

[00:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Hixie: nice

[00:39:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
I happen to prefer using Opera... Does Opera not support the feature or does your feature only work in MSIE?

[00:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt it works in IE

[00:39:02.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: what's it supposed to do?

[00:40:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
It tells me it only works in MSIE though...

[00:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: i hope to evneutally develop it to allow us to annotate sections of the spec

[00:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
OmegaJunior: seems to work fine in opera 9.x

[00:40:03.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Wouldn't that require a javascripted write action to the server document?>

[00:41:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: so the javascript is supposed to do what then?

[00:41:01.0000] <OmegaJunior>
OK, I'll try again and disregard the status message.

[00:41:02.0000] <jacobolus>
i.e. what does SpecStatusNetworkConnection do?

[00:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: the XXX bits?

[00:41:04.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: it's the API between the UI and the server

[00:41:05.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: it'll do XHR calls to the cgi scritps (which are also yet to be written)

[00:42:00.0000] <jacobolus>
gotcha

[00:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
basically it implements what that PROTOCOL file describes

[00:42:02.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Cute

[00:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyway, unless someone beats me to it, i'll work on those XXX bits tomorrow :-)

[00:42:04.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: so those XXX bits are pretty simple then.  they just do a cgi call and then update the UI?

[00:42:05.0000] <OmegaJunior>
It's like Google Maps, using Javascript to add material to a server-based file

[00:42:06.0000] <Hixie>
then it's the server side, unless mike smith beats me to it

[00:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: just do a cgi call and then invoke the callback, yeah

[00:43:01.0000] <jacobolus>
aha.  so why are they all separate functions? seems like it'll just be repeated code

[00:43:02.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Hixie: you\re right, the feature does work in Opera 9. The Implementation Status tells us otherwise.

[00:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
OmegaJunior: you may be confusing the test data with some sort of report on the code itself

[00:44:01.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Possible

[00:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: look at the PROTOCOL file, they each have different things they have to send

[00:44:03.0000] <OmegaJunior>
:)

[00:45:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Oh, I see. Yes, I did misinterpret that Implementation Status.

[01:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: very cool.

[01:22:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, ie doesn't seem to interpret us-ascii as windows-1252

[01:22:01.0000] <zcorpan>
it seems to convert high bytes to some ascii character

[02:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I need Open Source (non-viral) author readable succinct descriptions of the expected syntax for each attribute value microsyntax in HTML5

[02:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
should I write my own?

[02:52:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Delegate to working group? 

[02:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
which one? the WHATWG? W3C document output is not Open Source in general

[02:54:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Hmm.

[02:54:01.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Start a draft on WikiPedia, select open source license, have others add on and correct.

[02:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I guess I'll start a draft on the WHATWG wiki as its licensing policy suits my needs

[02:56:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Suggested WikiPedia for the larger audience.

[02:56:01.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Granted, WhatWG wiki will reach target group.

[03:25:00.0000] <mpt>
OmegaJunior, Wikipedia is licensed under the FDL, which is share-alike aka viral

[03:26:00.0000] <mpt>
And you'd likely have people crying "WP:NOT", too

[03:26:01.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Hmm. MediaWiki allows several license options. I had hoped WikiPedia would allow that as well.

[03:27:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
People will cry that about any kind of social encyclopedia, but also about any non-open source too

[03:27:01.0000] <OmegaJunior>
They'll cry because they like to cry.

[03:27:02.0000] <mpt>
particularly "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information"

[03:27:03.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Is anything?

[03:28:00.0000] <mpt>
No, but that's not relevant to this question :-)

[03:28:01.0000] <OmegaJunior>
:D

[03:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
It seems to me there's quite a bit of original research on Wikipedia and people complain semirandomly when they don't like the results

[03:30:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
So they should do their own research and publish their own results.

[03:31:00.0000] <mpt>
There's quite a bit of lots of things that are against Wikipedia policy on Wikipedia, and some people will remove it for political reasons, but others will remove it because it's against Wikipedia policy

[04:30:00.0000] <jacobolus>
hsivonen: they mostly complain when they know that some bit of it is BS

[04:30:01.0000] <jacobolus>
(which is quite common :)

[04:30:02.0000] <jacobolus>
some "original research" is pretty useful, and sticks around

[04:31:00.0000] <jacobolus>
hsivonen: what's an attribute value microsyntax?

[04:31:01.0000] <hsivonen>
jacobolus: e.g. floating point number, media query, MIME type, IRI reference

[04:32:00.0000] <jacobolus>
why do you need a non-viral license?

[04:33:00.0000] <jacobolus>
or you want to incorporate it into some non-free derivative work?

[04:35:00.0000] <jacobolus>
hsivonen: how many of those are there? is it a major undertaking to write such a document?

[04:37:00.0000] <hsivonen>
http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MicrosyntaxDescriptions

[04:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jacobolus: I want the software as a whole to be embeddable as widely as possible and I want it to be packageable for Debian which is likely to invoke GPLv3 for some parts and I can't have competing strong copyleft licenses in there

[04:39:00.0000] <jacobolus>
gotcha

[04:39:01.0000] <jacobolus>
yeah, that is pretty many of them :)

[04:39:02.0000] <jacobolus>
shouldn't be too hard to fill in if you put out a blog post or something

[04:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
jacobolus: I think I'll fill in a sample entry and then announce the project on the wiki

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. a couple of Polish link spammers have found the WHATWG blog

[05:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zapped the moderation queue

[05:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I wrote sample content for language tags: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MicrosyntaxDescriptions#Language

[05:25:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does it look author-readable?

[05:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
that is, is it a good sample?

[05:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
can anyone think of a politically correct non-contrived example of a language tag that has language, non-default script and a region?

[05:35:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy, Hixie: blog.whatwg.org warns that WordPress is out of date

[05:35:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: it looks ok to me

[05:35:02.0000] <zcorpan>
(the language tag text, that is)

[05:36:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, yes, I'm aware. It's just a minor revision update that I need to do later

[05:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: thanks.

[05:36:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: ok

[05:38:00.0000] <hsivonen>
posted announcement

[05:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me gets an index of/ at blog.whatwg.org

[05:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: weird. works for me

[05:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I just tried upgrading, but will have to do it later

[05:46:01.0000] <Lachy>
things got messed up. it's restored now

[05:55:00.0000] <zcorpan>
works now, yep

[05:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
blog is now upgraded

[05:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
I should probably update the wiki to the latest version of media wiki later too

[05:58:00.0000] <dglazkov>
hi all

[06:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: links point to 404s in the blog

[06:35:01.0000] <zcorpan>
e.g. http://blog.whatwg.org/microsyntax-descriptions

[06:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, hsivonen, fixed. I just forgot to copy .htaccess

[06:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: thanks

[08:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/test/xml/xml-stylesheet/

[08:00:01.0000] <zcorpan>
time to start drafting a spec

[08:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
any opinions off-hand?

[08:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: do you mean you are going to write style sheet PI 5?

[08:02:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yes

[08:02:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nice

[08:02:03.0000] <hsivonen>
so many specs in need of the 5 treament

[08:02:04.0000] <zcorpan>
indeed

[08:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
btw, does someone know enough xslt to know how http://simon.html5.org/test/xml/xml-stylesheet/support/transform.xml can be modified such that the <title> survives the transform?

[08:08:01.0000] <zcorpan>
/me knows close to nothing about xslt

[09:46:00.0000] <gsnedders>
hmmm… my site rather breaks in IE5.01. sorry 0.25% of my site's visitors. the 0.2% using IE5.5 are fine, though

[09:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
My recent sites break in IE6 and IE7 too, and it was only intentional in one of them

[09:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
(*one of the sites)

[09:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
interesting. ie parses entities twice when you feed it xml with a css stylesheet -- once with the xml parser and then again with the html parser

[09:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
test case: <?xml-stylesheet type='text/css'?><a>&amp;amp;</a>

[09:58:01.0000] <zcorpan>
(actual result: "&", expected result: "&amp;")

[09:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
you can also use &amp;auml; or so to confirm that html entities work

[10:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/specs/xml-stylesheet5

[11:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
well. the http group is a whole new level of wow.

[11:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ?

[11:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: multi-content-type?

[11:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: or the RFC 2119 discussion?

[12:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: all mail to that list in the last 24 hours

[12:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: well, over 50% of that is RFC 2119 :(

[12:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if he actually has any homework that isn't overdue

[12:50:00.0000] <gsnedders>
why the hell does the UCAS pre-registration form require you to choose six subject areas you may be interested in studying at higher education!?

[12:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
Pre-registration?

[12:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I guess this isn't the same as the thing where you choose six courses/universities to apply to)

[12:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: nowadays you're meant to get a UCAS card in Year 12/S5

[12:53:00.0000] <gsnedders>
this form is badly marked up and badly worded and illogical.

[12:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, okay

[12:53:02.0000] <gsnedders>
do not…receive…by mail

[12:53:03.0000] <gsnedders>
do…receive…by email

[12:53:04.0000] <gsnedders>
do…receive…by text messaging

[12:53:05.0000] <gsnedders>
can we not be consistent!?

[12:54:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me wonders if he can get away with putting just four subjects down

[12:54:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's annoying when they take a mostly-understandable paper form and then migrate to an online system which doesn't work and doesn't make sense and is full of errors

[12:54:02.0000] <gsnedders>
(as, quite frankly, if I didn't get in for any of them, I wouldn't go to uni)

[12:54:03.0000] <gsnedders>
it seems to have worked

[12:54:04.0000] <Philip`>
and then charge you £20 to apply onlnie instead of on paper

[12:54:05.0000] <gsnedders>
heh

[12:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
*online

Philip`: you're at Cam, aren't you?

[12:55:02.0000] <Philip`>
I am

[12:55:03.0000] <gsnedders>
which college?

[12:55:04.0000] <Philip`>
King's

[12:55:05.0000] <gsnedders>
nice

[12:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think it is :-)

[12:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
my sister went to Sewlyn to do law

[12:56:02.0000] <gsnedders>
however you spell it :)

[12:56:03.0000] <gsnedders>
admittedly, my sister is far older than me (i.e., old enough to legally be my mother!)

[12:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
*Selwyn :-p

[12:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
yeah, phonetically that makes more sense

[13:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
I walk past Selwyn most days, but don't really know much about it except that I don't particularly like the name

[13:00:01.0000] <gsnedders>
the actual quad is nice, not so the rest of the site

Question 2 of my Computing homework (given to 16/17 y/os): "What is a _user interface_?"

[13:02:00.0000] <gsnedders>
now, time to try and get back to doing my homework :)

[13:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
(My old physics teacher was quite happy that Cambridge forces you do to Natural Sciences for a year instead of something specialised like physics, since he originally went there to do chemistry and then changed his mind)

[13:06:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me writes date in ISO8601 form, just too confuse most of his teachers and prove he will not be forced to break specs :P

[13:06:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(in the basic form, and therefore without hyphens)

[13:07:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: I haven't done any other sciences since before the two-year Standard Grade (GCSE equiv.) course started

[13:08:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: ironically, I am actually better than some people who have done chemistry/biology Standard Grade

[13:09:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I occasionally wish I had done chemistry, but I've never liked biology at all really

[13:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
There are a few options in the NatSci first year that don't require any previous knowledge, like, uh, geology

[13:12:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I will most likely go to Edi, and go straight into second year (as traditionally in Scotland you go to uni after S5 — I'm staying on to S6 and will have done A-Level equivs. (some people just take two years to get to A-S level equivs.))

[13:13:00.0000] <gsnedders>
and going straight into second year limits the options for outside subjects, partly as you have extra teaching of the one or two things you'll be missing from the slightly more specialist course at uni

[13:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
How much of the algorithm is actually designed by the programmers in large software development companies?

[13:16:01.0000] <gsnedders>
/me has his doubts about quite how true what he is being taught is

[13:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
"the algorithm"?

[13:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
i.e., a formal design such as that within HTML 5's UA requirements

[13:36:00.0000] <gsnedders>
as is taught, every tiny smallest stage is defined

[14:13:00.0000] <jgraham_>
/me points out that he did Cellular Biology in his first year of Natural Sciences despite not having done Biology since GCSE

[14:14:00.0000] <jgraham_>
(although in retrospect the computer science option would have been much more useful, although Cells was fun)

[14:16:00.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham: I stopped the two before GCSE equiv :P

[14:21:00.0000] <jgraham_>
hmm my keyboard just stopped working entirely.

[14:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
(I'm not sure the first year of CS is especially useful, particularly the 25% version - most of the interesting bits come in later years)

[14:21:02.0000] <jgraham_>
Philip`: The same is true of almost all of Nat. Sci.

[14:22:00.0000] <jgraham_>
I guess

[14:26:00.0000] <jgraham_>
/me finds it slightly odd that he works ~5 minutes from Philip` yet they have never knowingly met

[14:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me won't have the excuse in a month's time of having a grand-mother in Cambridge

[14:28:00.0000] <jgraham_>
gsnedders: the excuse for what?

[14:28:01.0000] <gsnedders>
jgraham_: going to Cambridge

[14:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
jgraham_: It seems surprisingly hard to meet people accidentally - there are a few people in Cambridge from my previous school who I've only encountered by chance about twice in three years

[14:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
(or maybe that's just because I don't hang around the colleges much)

[16:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
arg, karl is again implying (not very subtly) that browser vendors are somehow hostile to the desires of web developers

[16:01:01.0000] <jgraham_>
Hixie: where?

[16:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
public-html

[16:02:00.0000] <jgraham_>
/me hasn't got that yet

[16:03:00.0000] <jgraham_>
Oh. What an odd email.

[16:06:00.0000] <Dashiva>
The vast browser-wing conspiracy lives on

[16:08:00.0000] <jgraham_>
I wonder why browser makers would want to implement features that "a big majority" of web designers and developers were opposed to.

[16:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think the history of whatwg has shown that should that happen, the spec changes pretty fast to match the desires of said developers

[16:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think most browser vendors would like to give web designers what they need and want, on the engine side

[16:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: of course, that's the easiest way to get web developer mindshare, which is a good way to get more market share

[16:26:01.0000] <othermaciej>
certainly Apple has no nefarious plan to force in features that web designers actively are hostile to

[16:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: i'm baffled as to why karl believes otherwise

[16:26:03.0000] <othermaciej>
and I can't imagine what motive we'd have to do so

[16:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
not only that, but I am not sure there is such a thing as a feature that a majority of web developers hate so much that they don't want to see it implemented

[16:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, they'd just ignore it if they didn't like it

[16:27:02.0000] <othermaciej>
that they would be actively upset to see it

[16:28:00.0000] <jgraham_>
I assume he feels that browsers are over-represented in the group and other communities are under represented and therefore concludes that we might do something browser friendly that is hostile to those other communities. But I don't think the conclusion follows in general (for the reason mentioned)

[16:29:00.0000] <jruderman>
what feature is he unhappy about?

[16:29:01.0000] <jgraham_>
although in can in specific cases e.g. features that are hard to use in a WYSIWYG editor

[16:29:02.0000] <othermaciej>
browser vendors are highly motivated by economic incentives to do what web developers and end users want

[16:29:03.0000] <gavin>
jruderman: I don't think he's pointed to a specific feature

[16:30:00.0000] <jgraham_>
othermaciej: agreed

[16:31:00.0000] <jgraham_>
I guess s/for the reason mentioned/for the reasons mentioned by othermaciej and Hixie/

[16:32:00.0000] <webben>
I wonder if " some features of the  specification" could actually just mean "some aspects of the specification"

[16:33:00.0000] <webben>
(especially given the immediate context was a discussion of whether things should be namespaced, which is more of an implementation detail than a feature)

[16:33:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it is highly unlikely that a majority of web developers want specific features to be in a foreign namespace

[16:34:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it is highly unlikely that a majority of web developers would even know what that means, let alone have an opinion

[16:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is a foreign namespace one that's written in German?

[16:36:00.0000] <webben>
othermaciej: Well, I guess the relevant datum is developers already namespacing stuff in text/html content.

[16:37:00.0000] <webben>
They don't really need to know what they're doing to have existing practices.

[16:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
webben: would that be evidence that web developers want built-in elements to be namespaced, or that web developers don't understand XML namespaces?

[16:38:00.0000] <webben>
Neither.

[16:38:01.0000] <webben>
But I suspect those devs don't want their content to break.

[16:39:00.0000] <webben>
And would not be perturbed by new features that were namespaced.

[10:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
wtf happened in public-html

[10:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
we had weeks of nice constructive discussion and suddenly a massive thread about nothing

[10:40:00.0000] <hober>
Yeah, I threw exactly one post in there to try to steer it toward specific changes to spec text: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007Nov/0319.html

[10:40:01.0000] <hober>
I doubt it actually helped though

[10:41:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: looks like I was wrong to stir the "Web pro syntax" thing

[10:41:01.0000] <hsivonen>
sorry

[10:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love the people demanding that we remove the option to omit quotes on attribute values

[10:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
especially given that there are significant groups demanding that we keep that feature

[10:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have to say though

[10:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand what all that thread was about

[10:46:02.0000] <Hixie>
if people want to write docs, they should do so

[10:46:03.0000] <Hixie>
as anne pointed out, the only people who have written intro docus so far are him and (to a lesser extent) me

[10:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
so if people want more docs, they should stop whining and just write

[10:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
well, I whined what I *don't* want written *within* the WG and it went downhill from there

[10:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess I should have waited for someone to write something before whining about the wrong thing getting written

[10:51:01.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose I could just get started and write something

[10:55:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: if you write something we won't have to worry about the wrong thing being written :-)

[10:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: yeah, i think in retrospect when an area has a history if being all talk and no action, whining about the potential action is counterproductive

[10:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i guess we learn something every day :-)

[10:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
Chaals indicated he's happy for me to work on it, should I check with DanC or Karl if their happy for me to be an editor first?

[11:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i see no reason _not_ to check, but they'd be pretty silly to say no :-)

[11:14:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: anyway you can always publish it elsewhere if the w3c doesn't want it

[11:14:02.0000] <Hixie>
btw karl is no longer our staff contact

[11:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
that's mike smith now

[11:17:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
but karl is the one taking initiative on any work related to separate docs for authors

[11:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, that's why I thought I should check with him

[11:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as I can see, it's not necessary and probably not useful for me to involve myself

[11:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
Do I have write access to the html5 folder in CVS? I have it for webapi and waf, do I need to get it enabled for html5 too?

[11:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy - probably maybe

[11:19:02.0000] <Lachy>
I suppose I could just try it out when I have something to commit.  If not, do I just mail sysreq?

[11:20:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy - please try a commit

[11:20:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if it doesn't work, I can ping system team to set it up

[11:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
alright, I'll create an html-author folder for this

[11:21:01.0000] <Lachy>
it worked

[11:21:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy - maybe just htm5/authoring ?

[11:23:00.0000] <Lachy>
I figured html-author would be a good short name for when it eventually goes to /TR/html-author/

[11:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
but then html5-author would probably be better

[11:23:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me will fix it

[11:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy - name in the repository doesn't need to be the same as shortname for TR space

[11:27:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[11:27:02.0000] <Lachy>
so you want me to rename it to authoring?

[11:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy - it doesn't matter really

[11:28:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
If you've already created it

[11:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. canvas hit the html4all list

[11:29:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, I'll leave it. It's easier than trying to mess around renaming stuff in CVS (I've had bad experience with CVS in the past, I didn't want to risk it :-))

[11:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i can tell dev.w3.org doesn't have per directory access

[11:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me notes that Dreamweaver cannot handle opening and editing a 2MB file!

[11:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: using the spec as a stress test case?

[11:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
I was using the current spec as a starting point, and was just going to rewrite the intro and strip out all stuff aimed at implementers

[11:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
I'll have to find a better editor that can handle large files

[11:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
The spec needs reorganisation to be readable, not just stripping things out

[11:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, yeah, but it's got all the element definitions in there

[11:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
if all you want to do is make a version of the spec for authors, i'd wait for the spec itself to have that annotated

[11:37:02.0000] <Hixie>
i thought you wanted to write a totally separate document

[11:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
keeping a document in sync with the html5 spec is going to be a gigantic amount of work for you

[11:38:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, it will be more than than that. But it will include the element element definitions (i.e. the contnet models and dom apis) is a starting point

[11:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok, but fyi, the content models are very much in flux (i haven't yet looked at much of henri's feedback)

[11:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
I realise that

[11:39:02.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[11:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
just don't want you getting snowed in with make-work :-)

[11:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
afk, going to work

[12:12:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Lachy: on documents that large, the only thing that works is either VI or emacs

[12:19:00.0000] <Lachy>
I don't like vi or emacs, they're too complicated

[12:20:00.0000] <virtuelv>
OpenKomodo also handles some of the stuff I do ok-ish

[12:20:01.0000] <virtuelv>
(but it pretty much chokes on the html5 spec

[12:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: you are on Mac, TextWrangler works

[12:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
I do my editing on the PC cause it has a bigger screen and better keyboard

[12:39:01.0000] <Lachy>
I just use this macbook for IRC, IM clients, email, browsing, etc.

[12:40:00.0000] <Lachy>
I also need to find a nice CVS and SVN client for the mac that gives me a simple GUI like TortoiseSVN/CVS do on Windows

[12:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me uses command line and Eclipse

[12:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
command line and emacs baby

[12:42:02.0000] <Hixie>
(there's no other real solution that works under ssh)

[12:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
I like to avoid command line where possible, since it's requires too much typing

[12:43:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I just rediscovered that HTML5 floats and WF2 floats are different

[12:43:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's what scripts are for

[12:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. when I'm done with HTML5 (including WF2) datatypes, the only XSD thing left is ID or NCName

[12:45:01.0000] <Lachy>
hmm. OSX doesn't include the cvs command by default

[12:45:02.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: it does if you install everything that came in the box

[12:45:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: Leopard includes svn, too

[12:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
yeah you might have to install the dev tools

[12:45:05.0000] <hsivonen>
(everything includes the Developer Tools)

[12:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I installed the XCode tools earlier today

[12:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I need to come up with nice names for WF2 floats

[12:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
nice names for code and nice names for UI

[12:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
floating point number with optional exponent?

[12:47:02.0000] <hsivonen>
float-exp

[12:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, sorry about the mess there

[12:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
not sure exactly what we should do with those

[12:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
hopefully the forms task force will finish soon and we'll be able to finally merge WF2 with HTML5

[12:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
(hahaha)

[12:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh hey, only two more days til the "forms tf internal charter review period" ends

[12:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oops email, mimetype-list and charset-list have fallen through the cracks

[12:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
more entries for the wiki page

[12:50:02.0000] <hsivonen>
more code to write

[12:50:03.0000] <Hixie>
anyone want to lay odds on the review period being extended because everyone forgot to review the charter?

[12:50:04.0000] <Hixie>
i give it about even odds

[12:51:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: saying it here is tampering with the odds

[12:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
i guess so

[12:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
though i don't know in which direction :-)

[12:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I feel tempted to restrict charset-list to charsets that are implemented and sane

[12:52:01.0000] <hsivonen>
but I guess in theory I should scrape the IANA registry

[12:53:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I expect unexpected craziness in the email datatype

[12:53:01.0000] <Hixie>
i think i scoped out the craziness of the e-mail datatype

[12:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
by picking a strategic entry point for you

[12:54:01.0000] <hsivonen>
ah. excellent. thanks

[12:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh. cute. dependency on IDN and, therefore, Punycode

[12:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah yeah, can't help you avoid that, sorry.

[12:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
minor nit: I think you should say "addr-spec production" instead of "addr-spec token"

[13:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah, good point. can you send mail? i'll totally forget it by the time i get back to wf2.

[13:01:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: email sent

[13:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
ta

[13:03:00.0000] <Lachy>
I haven't seen any comments on public-forms-tf about the charter since the telcon at the end of october. I don't think anyone has reviewed it :-)

[13:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: yeah, exactly

[13:04:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's not really clear to me that anyone on the task force actually really cares, to be honest

[13:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
nice to know the task force working as expected :-)

[13:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
no comment

[13:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: is it intentional that 1. is a valid HTML5 float

[13:08:01.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[13:08:02.0000] <hsivonen>
it isn't a valid WF2 float

[13:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. .1 is also not a valid WF2 float

[13:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
i doubt any of the differences are intentional

[13:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
they were mostly based on whatever i found when reverse engineering stuff

[13:12:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's likely the wf2 stuff is based on what i thought would be good, vs html5's stuff which is based on legacy implementations

[13:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
makes sense since WF2 is a submission format

[13:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[13:13:02.0000] <hsivonen>
however, for consistency, .1 and 1. could be made non-conforming on the non-WF2 side

[13:13:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'd rather make them conforming on the other side, if they work

[13:13:04.0000] <Hixie>
but yeah

[13:13:05.0000] <Hixie>
(especially .1)

[13:13:06.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm not sure if that would help authors, though

[13:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah

[13:14:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I guess they are now as good as they are going to get

[13:14:02.0000] <hsivonen>
and authors just have to deal with the discrepancy with leading/trailing zero omission

[13:14:03.0000] <Hixie>
what are? authors? :-)

[13:14:04.0000] <Hixie>
oh, the formats

[13:14:05.0000] <Hixie>
i'd like them the same if we can

[13:14:06.0000] <Hixie>
but i'm not sure we can

[13:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
the wiki list of microsyntaxes keeps growing

[13:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
31 already. I'm going to add 2 more

[13:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and that's ignoring the inputmode attribute, because magically, it is actually possible to construct with RELAX NG list{}

[13:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[13:25:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2007OctDec/0241.html — more mailing list fun

[13:25:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in due course, I should write a by-reference spec for these 33 microsyntaxes

[13:26:00.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: actually it would make a lot of sense for ABNF to support namespaces

[13:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: since it's a programming format

[13:26:02.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: if you want oddities in the microsyntaxes in HTML 5, take a look at my emails on public-html (just search the subject for something like detailed spec review of common microsyntaxes)

[13:27:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: agreed

[13:27:01.0000] <Hixie>
the biggest problem with ABNF is that it is REALLY freaking hard to write ABNF in a way that defines error handling

[13:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's the main reason i don't use it much

[13:27:03.0000] <hsivonen>
gsnedders: I don't want oddities. I just think that the RELAX NG datatype library for HTML5 should have a spec

[13:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
(i used it for the event-source stuff, and even there, where i was TRYING to define error handling, i still made mistakes, and ended up having to duplicate the work in prose anyway)

[13:28:00.0000] <hsivonen>
precise enough to let someone write an interoperable implementation in another programming language without looking at my code

[13:28:01.0000] <Hixie>
i've found some sites that use an "adx.js" library

[13:28:02.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know anything about it?

[13:28:03.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: in reply to the one on the same list yesterday regarding error handling, I got told basically that I could do it in another spec, and they wouldn't do it

[13:28:04.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: cool, a license to write a replacement http spec from the http group

[13:28:05.0000] <Hixie>
gsnedders: sounds like a plan!

[13:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
RFC 26165

[13:29:01.0000] <gsnedders>
RFC2616bisbis

[13:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh maybe this is openads

[13:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
do mailto URL allow something crazier than what WF2 allows for the address?

[14:17:00.0000] <hsivonen>
bah. mediawiki does not like <samp>

[14:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.losingfight.com/blog/2006/08/11/the-sordid-tale-of-mm_menufw_menujs/ is funny

[14:45:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I've been in that "expert" position way too often. Who am I going to hate now? :P

[14:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
hehe

[14:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyone able to work out what tmv11.js is from?

[14:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: are you mining the most common scripts for declarative features to add?

[14:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm mining the most common scripts, yeah

[14:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
for various reasons, one of which is finding out what is needed for html5

[14:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's surprising how many scripts have pretty unique filenames

[14:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
(a strong argument against namespacing being needed, imho)

[14:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
and that's in a space with no need for unique names, given that we have domains and so forth to disambiguate

[14:54:00.0000] <Lachy>
I've made a start on the document http://lachy.id.au/temp/html5-authors.html

[14:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
"and un XHTML examples"

[14:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
s/un/in/

[14:56:02.0000] <Lachy>
fixed in local copy

[14:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
you can probably cut a lot out of the Terminology section

[14:57:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, I know. I cut out a bit already

[14:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
going to rewrite some of it to be more author-friendly

[14:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
in fact you should probably assume that nobody will read that section, they'll just jump to the subsection they care about, and thus the language should be unambiguous even without the terminology section

[14:58:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, good point

[14:58:02.0000] <Hixie>
you have the advantage that you don't need it to be perfectly defined, since this isn't normative

[14:58:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[15:18:00.0000] <Hixie>
wtf is this tmv11.js thing

[15:18:01.0000] <Hixie>
i can find lots of sites using tmv11.js, but they're all different

[15:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
yet the name seems unlikely to be coincidentally chosen by multiple different groups

[15:18:03.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.postimees.ee/lib/tmv11.js is one

[15:19:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wanna see avenue q again.

[15:19:01.0000] <Hixie>
er, wrong channel.

[15:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.diskusjon.no/tmv11.js

[15:19:03.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like a statistics tracker script

[15:20:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah but normally i can track these down to someone who made it

[15:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh hey they both point to statistik-gallup.net

[15:20:02.0000] <Hixie>
'course that returns a 404

[15:22:00.0000] <Dashiva>
To the web archive-mobile

[15:23:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Or not, robots.txt'd

[15:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'll just call it the statistik-gallup.net tracking script

[15:43:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Heh, I forgot all the heading elements in that HTML element quiz

[15:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wanna see the results for that quiz

[15:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
which elements do people remember?

[15:46:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, even though I forgot option, I still remember to use it :)

[15:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
30 seconds left

[15:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
18 elements remain

[15:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
hmmm

[15:50:01.0000] <Philip`>
They should make it like The Typing of the Dead, so you have to type in HTML element names to fend off hordes of zombies

[15:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
i forgot BASE, BASEFONT, BDO, DFN, DIR, KBD, LABEL, MENU, NOFRAMES, NOSCRIPT, OPTGROUP, PRE, Q, SAMP, SUB, SUP, TITLE

[15:51:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I got some of the obscure ones like bdo just because I remember them as obscure :)

[15:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[15:51:02.0000] <Hixie>
i'm just bad at remembering things like this

[15:51:03.0000] <Hixie>
i'm amazed i got 74

[15:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
wtf is http://cpro.baidu.com/cpro/ui/cp.js

[15:55:00.0000] <Dashiva>
I'd guess it's for embedding flash in an iframe based on that big function

[15:57:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Assembles lots of vars, then pushes them as query string to a PHP script used as src for the iframe...

[15:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
The variables like cpro_client and cpro_h look like inputs the script, so presumably they're set before this script is called

[15:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
*inputs to the script


2007-11-22
[16:00:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Yeah, probably local config done similar to google's urchin thing

[16:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.516545.com/bbs/archiver/?tid-280.html

[16:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
i just called it Baidu.

[16:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, a lot of pages refer directly to http://s.wordpress.com/wp-content/plugins/highlight/shCore.js 

[16:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
I imagine Baidu has plenty of other scripts, so maybe it's better to call it "Baidu contextual advertising" or something

[16:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
that's ok, i have lots of things that share the same name

[16:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders if Baidu offers language translation services too

[16:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
what does shCore.js do?

[16:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
It highlights

[16:12:01.0000] <Hixie>
syntax highlighter plugin for wordpress

[16:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
oddly, that url seems to be addressed more often than any other wordpress urls

[16:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm amazed at how many of these scripts are for stats collection

[16:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
i wish i spoke russian

[16:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know anything about http://autocontext.begun.ru/autocontext.js ?

[16:51:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me is disabling comments on old whatwg blog posts.

[16:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
too much spam?

[16:52:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'm getting annoyed with the constant moderation requests slipping through the spam filter

[16:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
can we point people to help⊙wo or something in the "comments are closed" message?

[16:52:02.0000] <Lachy>
it's only about 5 per day that get through (4910 sitting in the Akismet spam filter, though)

[16:53:00.0000] <Lachy>
I supppose I could update the template

[16:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think it'd be helpful, so that we don't lose potential contributors

[16:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
man, this is mind numbing work

[16:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
I also need to delete the bogus users that have registered. I cleared about 50 of them a few weeks ago and about a hundred have registered :-)

[16:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
i have seen so much bad JS today

[16:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[16:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
i wouldn't worry too much about bogus users

[16:59:04.0000] <Hixie>
do they cause any harm?

[16:59:05.0000] <Hixie>
not that i want to discourage you from maintaining the blog, i just don't want you to burn out doing it :-)

[17:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
although it's difficult to tell if some are legit, the obvious ones like "alltickets" and "handbagcollection" can go :-)

[17:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me stares at http://www230.clickeye.cn/common/clickeye.js

[17:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: hehe

[17:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
not much effort, it only took about 20 min to disable comments and should only take about 5 to sort out the bogus users

[17:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
k :-)

[17:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
i went it a few months ago and promoted those names i recognised

[17:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
does "export/sites/www/shared/scripts" mean anything to anyone?

[17:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
all done

[17:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have labelled 435 src="" attribute values

[17:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
and am about ready to shoot myself

[17:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
maybe i should take a break!

[17:13:00.0000] <Lachy>
I updated the authoring document with sections about the body and section elements

[17:13:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://lachy.id.au/temp/html5-authors.html

[17:14:00.0000] <Lachy>
it'll be similar to the spec, but with extra sections for talking about start/end tags, i18n and accessibility

[17:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
"XHTML Example: <img src="image" alt="example">" - s/X//

[17:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
Also maybe s/image/image.png/ so it's more obvious what's going on

[17:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Then I should be consistent and use movie.ogv

[17:18:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Could always use file.ext to avoid specifics

[17:18:01.0000] <Philip`>
Why avoid specifics?

[17:18:02.0000] <Hixie>
oo, only two more days until the two questionnaires are up

[17:18:03.0000] <Philip`>
Incidentally, .ogv seems an odd choice since I mentally expand it to "Ogg Vorbis" which is totally wrong

[17:19:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Because some people might complain about the spec endorsing specific formats

[17:19:01.0000] <Lachy>
realistic examples using real file extensions is better

[17:19:02.0000] <Hixie>
people will complain regardless of what you do

[17:19:03.0000] <Lachy>
ogv is ogg vorbis

[17:19:04.0000] <Hixie>
might as well be helpful :-)

[17:19:05.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It seems to be Ogg Video

[17:19:06.0000] <Lachy>
(I think that's what I saw in that draft RFC for video/ogg)

[17:19:07.0000] <Philip`>
which is Theora more than Vorbis

[17:19:08.0000] <Lachy>
oh right, I meant ogg video

[17:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: Then I vote for mkv instead :P

[17:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i vote for mpg :-)

[17:21:01.0000] <Philip`>
I think we should put videos in a PNG container, to get backward-compatibility with old UAs - they can still load the 600MB movie file and will just display the first frame

[17:21:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: :-P

[17:21:03.0000] <Philip`>
(i.e. put the poster frame in the IDAT, and use decent compression in custom chunks for the actual video)

[17:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's not that insane, really

[17:22:01.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, we could just use APNG for the video

[17:22:02.0000] <Lachy>
or GIF

[17:23:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: That would be insane, since it's even worse than MJPEG compression :-p

[17:23:01.0000] <Lachy>
yeah but PNG is lossless compression, so it's better quality

[17:24:00.0000] <webben_>
Would be possible (I'm not talking about useful) to declare the HTML serialization of HTML5 in SGML terms? And if not, is there a handy list anywhere of fundamental incompatibilities that make that impossible?

[17:24:01.0000] <Philip`>
Good point - and you could use 16-bit colour channels if you want really excellent quality

[17:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: yes, you could describe a serialisation of html using any tree-based syntax

[17:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: you could describe a JSON serialisation, e.g.

[17:25:02.0000] <webben_>
no

[17:26:00.0000] <webben_>
I mean could you describe the HTML serialization (not fully, but compatibly) using an SGML declaration and DTD?

[17:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
oh, i see

[17:26:02.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[17:26:03.0000] <Hixie>
probably not

[17:26:04.0000] <Philip`>
webben_: Does that include error handling, or only parsing conformant HTML-serialised character streams into the same tree as the HTML5 algorithm?

[17:26:05.0000] <Hixie>
it has some weirdass things

[17:26:06.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, what about audio? AFAIK, PNG doesn't support audio tracks :-)

[17:26:07.0000] <Hixie>
you could probably get quite close

[17:26:08.0000] <Hixie>
but i doubt you could exactly define it

[17:27:00.0000] <webben_>
Philip`: I don't know enough about SGML-parsing conformance requirements to say.

[17:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Just define an Audio PNG extension

[17:27:02.0000] <webben_>
I'm not talking about expressing everything that html5 forbids necessarily, but perhaps everything it allows?

[17:27:03.0000] <Philip`>
Encode the audio track as a greyscale image, and stick that into the movie somewhere

[17:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2007Nov/0080.html

[17:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
webben_: there are weird things like the way we treat entities in <textarea> that i don't think you can describe

[17:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
in sgml

[17:32:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i could be wrong

[17:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
so i would answer "no" to your question

[17:32:04.0000] <webben_>
Hixie: OK. Thanks. :)

[18:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, re your post to public-html, does google really care about keeping documents small? I assume they realise that if it was really that really that important, the could save a whole heap just by cleaning up their homepage

[21:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wow, I hadn't heard that Opera is opening a Mountain View office

charset list and map coordinates to go...

[02:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
aargh. a dependency on HTML4!

[02:59:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"Authors must not specify an encoding other than UTF-8 or US-ASCII in the accept-charset attribute when the method used is get and the action indicates an HTTP resource." yay. that's a fun requirement

[02:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the requirement depends on the document base URI

[03:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: hence, the document may cease to be conforming if you move it

[04:01:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: regarding my email to public-html about accept-charset: it would help to get your current guess about where the requirements are headed

[04:08:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, allowing commas as separators in accept-charset makes sense because the value can then be consistent with the HTTP AcceptCharset header value

[04:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: it still sucks from the SGML/XML/HTML design patterns point of view

[04:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
have you tested to see what browsers actually support?

ISO reaches out with advocacy FAQs: http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_widely_used_standards/widely_used_standards_other/date_and_time_format.htm

[04:35:01.0000] <hsivonen>
now if they could serve their PDFs without zip wrappers...

[05:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.iso.org/iso/date.jpg - it's weird how my brain can decode the tiny letters there, but if I zoom in then it turns into a meaningless lump of grey pixels

[05:51:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It's also weird how they don't link to a larger version of that image)

[05:52:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Philip`: damn you and your eye-sight!

[05:55:00.0000] <virtuelv>
Philip`: heh. Same experience here

[06:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
X3D appears to have a lot more undefined behaviour than what web browsers seem to appreciate :-(

[07:28:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, I have seen a larger version of that image previously. Though I have no idea where to find it

[11:39:00.0000] <jruderman>
Philip`: zooming with smoothing or with nearest-neighbor?

[11:39:01.0000] <jruderman>
Philip`: with smoothing, zooming doesn't seem to hurt the readability for me

[11:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I could use examples of invalid IDNs, but the obvious google terms don't help me

[11:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Do I understand correctly that there is no proper spec for IDN-aware mailto: IRI scheme?

[11:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
am I right that "foo@" is an invalid email address? or is there something I'm missing?

[11:57:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. I think I have established that the Jena IRI library doesn't do proper scheme-aware mailto: IRI validation

[12:07:00.0000] <Philip`>
jruderman: Nearest-neighbour (i.e. what Opera and FF3 do)

[12:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone remember off-hand whether XMPP addresses are defined by reference to RFC 2822 or whether it is a similar-looking standalone syntax?

[12:17:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I want to say a subset of RFC 2822, but I might be wrong

[12:17:01.0000] <hsivonen>
http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html section 3.1.

[12:17:02.0000] <hsivonen>
looks like they defined their own

[12:18:00.0000] <hsivonen>
in a remarkably sane way I might add

[12:18:01.0000] <gsnedders>
hsivonen: doesn't 2822 make anything look sane? :)

[13:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why X3D uses the "DEF" attribute for IDs, instead of "id" or "xml:id" or something

[13:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: are they really IDs?

[13:50:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: CML makes id non-ID

[13:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: The schema says <xs:attribute name="DEF" type="xs:ID"> so I assume that means they're IDs

[13:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: ok

[13:52:01.0000] <Philip`>
I guess getElementById won't work, which is a pain

[14:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is XPath like //*[DEF="foo"] likely to be horribly slow in Firefox/Opera?

[14:25:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Compared to what? gEBTN and attribute checking?

[14:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
Compared to precomputing a hash of DEF->object, I guess

[14:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
I suppose it depends on how many lookups I'm doing and how big the document is, and I've got no idea about those at the moment, so I should forget about it unless it becomes a problem in practice

[14:28:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Sounds like a plan. No need to overoptimize something that might not even be a bottleneck

[14:28:01.0000] <Philip`>
Also no need to optimise something that will probably never get anywhere near completion either :-)

[14:58:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: relating to what we were talking about yesterday: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2007OctDec/0270.html

http://politics.reddit.com/info/6181z/comments/c02ijhx <-- can't we morph to april 1st and add <sicko>

[00:35:00.0000] <Lachy>
/me notes that he's currently living in "The World's Best Country to live in" (Norway), but actually disagrees with it.

[00:35:01.0000] <Lachy>
Australia is actually the best country to live in ;-)

[00:37:00.0000] <othermaciej>
my favorite country to live in is California

[00:37:01.0000] <othermaciej>
unfortunately we remain under US occupation

[00:37:02.0000] <othermaciej>
but even so it's quite nice

[00:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I figured the "Designed by Apple in California" thing was a not so subtle way of distancing California from the rest of the US

[00:44:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: nah, it's just because the idea of California has semiotic resonance with Apple's brand identity

[00:45:00.0000] <mpt>
/me is momentarily distracted by Wikipedia's "Californian independence" article

[00:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: my Leopard box puts California and Ireland on the same depth in the implied taxonomy tree and doesn't mention the US or the EU at all

[00:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think the EU considers itself a country yet

[00:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(by box I didn't mean computer but the packaging the Leopard DVD came in)

[00:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"Designed by Apple in California" "Assembled in Ireland"

[00:50:00.0000] <hsivonen>
back to RFCs: do I understand correctly that the generic scheme-unaware IRI restrictions merely ban some code points after the scheme and that's it?

[00:55:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't know

[00:55:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so far IRIs have not been relevant to actual web content so I haven't learned what that RFC says yet

[00:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. interesting PUA characters are banned in the non-query part of the IRI

[01:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
yay! javascript: IRIs have different character rules before and after a question mark in the script

[01:27:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ?

[01:30:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: now I'm not sure if I'm reading the RFC in the wrong way of if the Jena IRI lib has a bug

[01:31:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: but it seems to me that private use characters are allowed in the query part of the IRI per grammar but not in the path part

[01:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: but the Jena IRI lib gives an error in both cases anyway...

[01:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Why does draft-hoehrmann-javascript-scheme-00 say: 'literal use of the character "/" should be avoided'?

[01:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: probably to avoid looking like a hierarchical URL

[01:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I don't think it is a problem in practice

[01:52:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: I don't see why looking like a hierarchical URL would be a problem even in theory

[01:53:00.0000] <othermaciej>
hsivonen: you'd have to ask Bjoern

[01:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yeah

[01:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
he usually has reasons for what he does

[02:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. are there generic IRI processors that take a base IRI and a relative IRI and process them to produce a new absolute IRI that represents the relative IRI absolutized relative to the base IRI?

[02:06:01.0000] <hsivonen>
is there any non-contrived scenario where a javascript: IRI might participate in such processing?

[02:08:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I dunno, in what cases are things actually processed as IRIs?

[02:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I don't know.

[02:20:00.0000] <hsivonen>
will a browser ever consider an HTML document to have a javascript: URI as its base URI?

[02:26:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
hsivonen: i have no idea what you're talking about but "/" is discouraged in javascript in an html context because it could erroneous close a script tag

[02:27:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me added date and datetime text to the wiki

[02:27:01.0000] <hsivonen>
mitsuhiko: I am talking about javascript: IRIs

[02:28:00.0000] <mitsuhiko>
hmm. makes no sense then :)

[02:28:01.0000] <hsivonen>
mitsuhiko: that is, whether javascript:alert(4/2) is valid without percent escaping the /

[02:48:00.0000] <virtuelv>
hsivonen: works in at least two browsers

[03:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
virtuelv: ok. (I expected unescaped form to work in browsers)

[03:09:00.0000] <virtuelv>
javascript:4/2 both outputs 2 in Opera and FF

[03:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I emailed Björn to ask for the rationale of the restriction

[10:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: i got a prince license. what should i do to set up prince as part of the spec creation pipeline any proposals?

[10:45:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: http://hsivonen.iki.fi/printing-wa10/

[10:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: first, you should get DejaVu working with Prince

[10:46:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: then perhaps diff this http://hsivonen.iki.fi/printing-wa10/specification-a4.css with your current style sheet and add my stuff in @media print

[10:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: might be better to leave the paper size to command line

[10:47:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: and run it once with A4 and once with Letter

[10:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: of and the entity table needs a something to select outside it unless Prince has added ::outside to tables while I wasn't looking

[10:48:01.0000] <hsivonen>
s/of/oh/

[10:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
DejaVu?

[10:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

[10:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
If you are running Prince on Linux, you might already have it out of the box if Prince finds the fonts that came with the distro

[10:55:01.0000] <hsivonen>
If Prince fails to find glyphs for all the characters you put in the spec, it'll tell you

[10:56:00.0000] <Hixie>
no fonts came with this distro

[10:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
i wonder how i install this dejavu thing into my local user

[10:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: you can install it in Prince's own font directory if you like

[10:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, dejavu has good coverage of the pages i need

[10:59:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I spent some time googling for a font that had WARNING SIGN

[11:00:00.0000] <gsnedders>
html5lib's repo has an external to itself, but it uses the https:// URL which only works for project members

[11:00:01.0000] <hsivonen>
(Code200* crashed Cocoa or something)

[11:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't have mscorefonts either

[11:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
good lord these corefonts are hard to get easily

[11:05:00.0000] <Falen>
Is there any open-source HTML parser in C? To convert HTML->Text, and read tags.. etc..

[11:05:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: both Ubuntu and suse make it easy

[11:06:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't have root on this debian box

[11:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
man the lengths i go to sometimes

[11:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me downloaded the .EXEs, downloaded the source to cabextract and compiled it, extracted the TTFs...

[11:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
btw the fonts changed names since you did the patch

[11:18:00.0000] <Philip`>
Falen: There's a tokeniser in C++, which might not be quite what you want but at least it exists :-)

[11:22:00.0000] <webben_>
Falen: libtidy is in C ... you might be able to adapt that

[11:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, I forgot about non-HTML5 HTML parsers - that would presumably make it easier

[11:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: http://damowmow.com/a.pdf

[11:59:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: my stylesheet had changed quite a bit so diffing it didn't work well, but i tried to take what i thought was important

[11:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: any advice? (prince in particular seems to have a problem with indenting with <dd>s?)

[12:07:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the space between the left page edge and the body box should probably be much narrower

[12:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: also, I'd get rid of the colors and link underlines

[12:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa page 78 is not good

[12:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: I didn't have the dd problems, but I serialized from firefox

[12:10:01.0000] <jgraham_>
gsnedders: Yeah I should just fix that (there was a reason for it but the side effect is unacceptable)

[12:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: in case Prince doesn't do end tag inference right, parsing and serializing with html5lib would probably help

[12:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: it appears you omitted the bit that made the entity table multicolumn and thus more compact

[12:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: table in section 5.3.2 needs special font size attention

[13:30:00.0000] <ddfreyne>
Hm, question.

[13:30:01.0000] <ddfreyne>
The 'b' and 'i' elements... should these be interpreted as purely presentational, or do they have some semantic value as well?

[13:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
ddfreyne, see http://lachy.id.au/log/2007/05/b-and-i

[13:31:01.0000] <ddfreyne>
I'm thinking purely presentational; you'd use them where you would usually use bold and italic in non-hyper text, am I right?

[13:31:02.0000] <ddfreyne>
thanks

[13:32:00.0000] <ddfreyne>
sweet, that's exactly what I was thinking

[13:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
You'd use them where you would usually use bold and italic in non-hyper text if otherwise some meaning would be lost, but not where you'd use them just because they're pretty

[13:34:01.0000] <ddfreyne>
yeah, exactly

[13:34:02.0000] <ddfreyne>
I was just thinking of blog posts marked up like "<b><i>hello, blah blah blah</i></b>"

[13:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Woah, I only just noticed that X3D doesn't use a namespace)

[13:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the left side gap is intentional (for issue notes and handwritten margin notes)

[13:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: the colours are also intentional (for colour printing) and the link underlines are useful to know exactly what is being hyperlinked

[13:38:01.0000] <Hixie>
though i suppose i could remove them

[13:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: fixed the column thing

[13:39:01.0000] <Hixie>
kinda

[13:40:00.0000] <ddfreyne>
I was just thinking of blog posts marked up like "<b><i>hello, blah blah blah</i></b>"

[13:40:01.0000] <ddfreyne>
err.

[13:40:02.0000] <ddfreyne>
wrong window :)

[13:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm missing a bunch of glyphs still

[13:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: regenning a.pdf, take a look in a few minutes

[13:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Actually, the specification has no namespace, and a non-zero number of implementations produce non-namespaced content, but a non-zero number has "taken a few liberties until a firm specification is defined" and accepts content in the http://www.web3d.org/specifications/x3d-namespace namespace)

[13:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
(which seems kind of a suboptimal situation)

[13:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
http://html5.lachy.id.au/ has finally been restored.  I believe I have found the issue and that it was actually caused by other php scripts on my server, not these ones.

[14:59:00.0000] <jgraham_>
gsnedders: I fixed the svn:externals

[15:01:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me hugs jgraham_ for doing so (randomly)

[15:03:00.0000] <jgraham_>
/me feel more appreciated than normal for typing a few simple commands :)


2007-11-24
[16:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
ok well we now have pdf versions of the spec available

[16:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
there are some issues with prince and implied elements, but oh well

[16:24:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie - the PDF links are currently just in the version at the WHATWG site?

[16:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[16:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's enough work getting it working for the whatwg one without worrying about the w3c one too :-)

[16:35:00.0000] <annevk>
hopefully this encourages mikeday to make a C version of html5lib

[16:37:00.0000] <annevk>
whoa, the PDF is 3.4MB

[16:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
3.4MB seems reasonable given that the HTML version is about 2MB

[18:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
PDFs I generate from Prince even for small docs seem to end up around 600KB or more

[21:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
i love the type of comments lachlan has gotten

[21:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
they applaud his initiative, and then say he should do something else

[21:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
without actually DOING it

[21:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
heh

[21:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Well, I guess we need to figure out a way to facilitate collaboration on the document

[21:16:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy - you around?

[21:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
There is at least one person, Terry Morris, who's asked how he can help out

[21:29:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Maybe for now I should suggest that he submit his edits/changes to the current version

[21:29:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I suppose somebody will suggest soon that we need yet another mailing list for this

[23:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the pdf looks good. thank you

[23:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: my pleasure. thanks for the help.

[02:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, yo!

[02:34:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy - just wanted to point out message from Terry Morris offering to help on authors doc

[02:34:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess I could set him or anybody else up with ssh/cvs access to the source

[02:34:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
but would rather not unless/until

[02:35:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
they have actually produced something they want to contribute

[02:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, see my reply to him on public-html

[02:36:01.0000] <Lachy>
I've been thinking about how to manage people's contributions a bit too

[02:36:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I guess it's not worth spending too much time thinking about until there are some actual contributions from others

[02:37:00.0000] <Lachy>
I think the best way would be to set up a wiki page somewhere where people can write their suggestions

[02:38:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'd rather not just let anyone be co-editor with CVS access. I think it's worth waiting to find out how good their contributions are first.

[02:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
aye

[02:39:00.0000] <Lachy>
I know nothing about Terry Morris. What's his background, experience, past contributions, etc? So let's test people out on the wiki first

[02:41:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Right. For this kind of stuff I don't know what's the best way to encourage people to contribute.

[02:41:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
On code projects, I think it's normal to just ask people to contribute patches

[02:42:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
and if/when they've contributed enough to merit it, give them shared write access to the source

[02:43:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but code is different.  For articles, there's the issue of writing style, consistency and other measures of quality that can't be tested programmatically

[02:43:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
true that

[02:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
if there's anyone with actual spec/article/tutorial writing experience who's also had real web development experience, it might be good to make them co-editor

[02:45:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Yeah

[02:46:00.0000] <Lachy>
I wanted Roger Johansson to be a co-editor, but he said doesn't have time unfortunately

[02:47:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Anyway, I leave it up to you how you want to manage it. If anybody's not happy with what you decide, we can deal with it then. or they are always free to take initiative on developing an alternative version if they want

[02:48:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
bbl, gotta eat dinner

[02:48:01.0000] <Lachy>
ok, cya

[04:37:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy - fwiw, I checked in a makefile to dev.w3.org/html5 and added some makefiles in the html-authors subdir and some other subdirs that include it by reference

[04:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
so you can just run "make" to build if you want, or "make PUBDATE=2007-11-26" (or whatever) if you want to use a date other than the current one

[04:45:00.0000] <Lachy>
MikeSmith, cool. That won't be at all useful on my windows machine where I do my editing, but it could work if I migrated that to my mac

[04:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy - make works on Windows too I think

[04:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
Should work with Cygwin at least

[04:53:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
yeah, but I think there's even GNU make that runs under MS-DOS

[01:42:00.0000] <hendry>
is there a status page of what/when browser support input types like email, datetime etc?

[02:05:00.0000] <Lachy>
hendry, Opera has support for for those

[02:12:00.0000] <hendry>
Lachy: what about other browsers like gecko, webkit? is there some sort of ETA for those?

[02:15:00.0000] <webben>
hendry: A first port of call would be the bugzillas for both I guess.

[02:15:01.0000] <webben>
iirc webkit has some sort of type="range" implementation

[02:16:00.0000] <webben>
(whether it's actually complete ... e.g. can you adjust the slider with the keyboard?) I don't know

[02:19:00.0000] <hendry>
what about support for IE with JS? what's the status with that i wonder

[02:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
(WebKit range was integer-only when I last tried, which made my 0->1 slider a bit useless :-( )

[10:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
If I wanted to use GLSL fragment/vertex programs (i.e. an ASCII-only C-like language, for 3D graphics stuff) on the web, what would be a sensible MIME type?

[10:25:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm guessing something like .../x-glsl-fp and .../x-glsl-vp but have no idea if it's text/... or application/... or what and don't know where to find that out

[10:25:01.0000] <Hixie>
if it's a plain text format, use text/

[10:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
you'll have people complain that you should use application/, but they're just silly

[10:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
(The Mozilla canvas3d examples use x-shader/x-vertex and x-shader/v-fragment which look kind of crazy to me)

[10:26:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Uh, I meant x-shader/x-fragment)

[10:27:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Isn't using an x- on the major part even more frowned upon?

[10:28:00.0000] <Hixie>
yes

[10:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
Apparently "The source character set used for the OpenGL shading languages is a subset of ASCII." so it's plain text in that sense, though not in the humans-can-read-the-plain-text-and-understand-it-fully sense

[10:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
is it meant to be human editable?

[10:30:01.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[10:30:02.0000] <Hixie>
then use text/

[10:30:03.0000] <Philip`>
Okay - sounds plausible, so I'll try that :-)

[10:32:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries to work out whether they're called fragment programs or fragment shaders or pixel shaders

[11:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
so the html5 spec is about 500 pages

[11:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
and we've been working on it for about 3 years

[11:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: if you do find good reusable HTML5 presentation demo materials, please let me know. I've agreed to speak about HTML5 on 3th of December

[11:42:03.0000] <Hixie>
i've been working on it at about 40 hours a week for that time

[11:42:04.0000] <Hixie>
so that's about 12 hours per page

[11:42:05.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: there's some stuff on hte wiki

[11:42:06.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: who are you talking to?

[11:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: the event is organized by the student association of the CS dept. at University of Helsinki. The invitations go out to Finnish Unix Users' Group and Finnish Linux Users' Group as well

[11:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
nice

[11:45:01.0000] <hsivonen>
whoa. I actually type 3th instead of 3rd. scary

[11:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
heh

[11:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't even notice

[11:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
so the glyphs i'm missing are U+525B U+5FD7 U+6FA4 U+9ED2 U+C11D U+C724 U+CC2C U+FE6A U+FF05

[11:47:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Hooray, there's a randomly-coloured 3D monkey head in my web browser)

[11:47:03.0000] <Hixie>
if anyone has any fonts i could use that contain those glyphs, please let me know

[11:47:04.0000] <Hixie>
so i can add them to the html5 print pipeline

[11:47:05.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: heh

[11:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry blogged about free CJK fonts a while ago

[11:49:00.0000] <Hixie>
/me adds h2 { page-break-before: always }

[11:49:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: oo, interesting

[11:49:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://natalian.org/archives/2007/05/31/chinese-font/ ?

[11:49:03.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: yeah. no answer there, though :-(

[11:50:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-(

[11:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
U+525B U+5FD7 U+6FA4 U+9ED2 U+C11D U+C724 and U+CC2C aren't in my nameslist.txt

[11:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me goes to update it

[11:58:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hey, can someone review an article for me? It's that one for a list apart I've been working on for a while, it's finally finished. Just got to prepare it for publishing

[12:01:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: i'm about to go out for a bit, but feel free to msg me the link and i'll look at it when i get back

[12:01:01.0000] <Lachy>
http://lachy.id.au/temp/Developing%20with%20HTML5%20ALA.doc

[12:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
(wtf. i updated both NamesList.txt and Unihan.txt, and I still can't find these characters. are they fictional? or in a special range or something...)

[12:01:03.0000] <Lachy>
I'll convert it to HTML shortly

[12:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
ah, i see my problem:

[12:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
# XXX should also search Unihan and Hangul

[12:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
sigh

[12:03:03.0000] <Hixie>
ok

[12:03:04.0000] <Hixie>
well i'm off to get food, will be back in a bit.

[12:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, btw, the images in the article will be modified to switch the article and section elements, based on your earlier feedback about 2 months ago

[12:31:00.0000] <hendry>
Hixie: the irc channel #dejavu has some font experts

[12:35:00.0000] <hendry>
dejavu sans doesn't have any CJK support... /usr/share/doc/ttf-dejavu/status.txt.gz sigh

[12:50:00.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: your second figure doesn't show the <div id='content'> element

[12:57:00.0000] <Lachy>
aroben, see my previous comment about the images getting fixed

[12:58:00.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: must have missed it, sorry

[13:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: back, if you have the html version

[13:10:01.0000] <Lachy>
sorry, not yet

[13:11:00.0000] <Lachy>
can you read word docs?

[13:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
sure

[13:11:02.0000] <Lachy>
ok, cool

[13:13:00.0000] <Hixie>
oh btw (unrelated to your article) it seems the xhtml2wg is going ahead with their repositioning, they now define themselves as an authoring format, not a web format

[13:13:01.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i can tell

[13:16:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, where have they said that? on the mailing list?

[13:16:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: where can I read about that?

[13:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
(html4all gives me a Bandwidth Limit Exceeded?)

[13:17:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, yeah, that happened yesterday. They're aware of it

[13:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.w3.org/2007/11/14-xhtml-minutes (search for 'authoring')

[13:17:03.0000] <Hixie>
also http://www.w3.org/2007/11/08-xhtml-minutes

[13:17:04.0000] <Hixie>
and http://www.w3.org/2007/11/09-xhtml-minutes

[13:45:00.0000] <Philip`>
(Oh, the Blender X3D exporter doesn't even work correctly when I make a monkey and a cube, so it's not just my code that's broken)

[14:29:00.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: there's at least one instance of "dependent" where you meant "dependant"

[14:32:00.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: the items in the "Benefits of Using the {HTML,XML} Serialisation" are not all parallel constructs

[14:32:01.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: some are sentences, some are sentence fragments, etc.

[14:32:02.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: it would be nice to make them all the same

[14:33:00.0000] <alp>
aroben: 'dependent' is a far more common usage than 'dependant'

[14:34:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/misc/x3d.png - how totally exciting

[14:34:01.0000] <aroben>
alp: hm,  I guess you're right

[14:34:02.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: ignore the "depdendent" comment

[14:34:03.0000] <aroben>
Philip`: what's that?

[14:34:04.0000] <alp>
vlad's 3d canvas stuff?

[14:35:00.0000] <aroben>
brb

[14:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
aroben: What alp said

[14:36:01.0000] <Philip`>
Oops, too late

[14:36:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Rendering X3D content in particular, because I want to get a better idea of why browsers shouldn't implement X3D natively)

[14:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: the article seems pretty good to me

[14:48:00.0000] <Philip`>
aroben: What alp said

[14:48:01.0000] <aroben>
Philip`: neat

[14:48:02.0000] <Philip`>
(Rendering X3D content in particular, because I want to get a better idea of why browsers shouldn't implement X3D natively)

[14:49:00.0000] <Lachy>
aroben, thanks

[14:49:01.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: I like the article

[14:49:02.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: and it'll be nice to have it published in such a visible place

[14:49:03.0000] <aroben>
(visible to web developers, anyway)

[14:51:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me needs to add some lighting and stuff, then add an opera-3d renderer to show how useless opera-3d is :-p

[14:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Does Mozilla's 3d canvas stuff use OpenGL?

[14:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: Yes

[14:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
(The API is OpenGL ES, so it's a subset of OpenGL, and it's currently implemented using OpenGL)

[14:53:02.0000] <othermaciej>
does that mean you can't alpha-composite things over it? Or does it just turn off hardware acceleration in that case?

[14:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
actually, I guess it must be rendering to a backing store anyway just to draw over normal canvas stuff

[14:54:01.0000] <othermaciej>
so likely not fully accelerated all the way to the screen

[14:55:00.0000] <alp>
othermaciej: it used to use glitz to render the graphics context to gl as well, iirc. don't know if it still does

[14:55:01.0000] <Lachy>
when did Mozilla add 3d canvas?

[14:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: I can put a translucent <div> over the 3d canvas and it all looks properly blended

[14:56:01.0000] <Lachy>
is it compatible with Opera's 3D canvas?

[14:56:02.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: It's currently just an unreleased extension

[14:56:03.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[14:56:04.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't think it's compatible

[14:56:05.0000] <Lachy>
so looks like we really need to get this standardised soon

[14:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and I think its existence as an extension predates Opera's API

[14:57:01.0000] <Philip`>
It's totally different to Opera's

[14:57:02.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, which one do you think is better from an authoring perspective?

[14:57:03.0000] <othermaciej>
my understanding is that Mozilla's is very low-level, pretty close to the actual OpenGL API

[14:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
Someone said Opera "implemented 3D Canvas 2-3 years ago" though I don't know how much they've changed since then

[14:58:01.0000] <aroben>
http://my.opera.com/timjoh/blog/2007/11/13/taking-the-canvas-to-another-dimension has some of the motivation behind Opera's API

[14:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Opera's one is easier to use if you're programming straight to the API and not using any helper libraries, except it barely has any features (e.g. you can't do dynamic lighting) and it would need some redesigning in order to support those features

[14:59:01.0000] <othermaciej>
it seems like if you want things like collision detection you might also want an API model with a fully retained scene graph

[15:00:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'd prefer to implement high-level scene graph things in JS, and have the browser provide just a low-level rendering API

[15:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
(hence me trying to implement X3D in JS to see if that's feasible)

[15:01:00.0000] <othermaciej>
is X3D a sensible spec?

[15:01:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I don't really know how it works

[15:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does it natively provide for things like collision detection, or embedding foreign markup as a texture and still being able to hit test it?

[15:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I gotta reboot

[15:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
I've only looked at small bits of X3D, and it seems far from perfect but not totally useless

[15:03:02.0000] <othermaciej>
back soon

[15:03:03.0000] <Philip`>
It has Collision sensors which can send events to make stuff happen

[15:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
X3D is full of undefined behaviour so I don't think browsers could reasonably implement it

/me stays by the shores of the sea of interoperability

[02:52:01.0000] <gsnedders>
(having followed the link to TBL's similar thing)

[03:21:00.0000] <gsnedders>
annevk2: in #whatwg!? what's happened?

[03:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: what Keynote feature did you use to create a timeline?

[03:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
/me is totally puzzled with Keynote not having an obvious way to turn a CVS table of labels and numbers into a bar chart

[05:14:00.0000] <hsivonen>
where might I find a reference to the W3C decision to leave 4.01 as the last version of HTML and move to XHTML

[05:20:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Not a good reference, but /tr/html leads to XHTML 1.0

[05:22:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Dashiva: I meant the meeting and its date when the XML course was decided

[05:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: last time i searched for it i didn't find anything

[05:39:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: ok. good to know

[05:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
which was... hmm, perhaps 2 years ago

[05:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, it would have been decided around 1998-1999 when work on XHTML began

[06:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
<title> <textarea> <style> <script> <xmp> <noscript> <iframe> <noembed> <noframes>

[06:51:01.0000] <zcorpan>
are there any others that are [R]CDATA elements?

[06:51:02.0000] <zcorpan>
<xml> in ie, i think, but other than that?

[06:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess <applet> and <object> are pseudo-CDATA in ie too

[08:42:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: feature request: it would be useful to be able to group errors by message (perhaps so by default even), because often there are lots of errors of the same type and you usually fix them with a search-and-replace

[08:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
e.g. http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cafefernando.com%2Fturkce%2F

[08:43:00.0000] <zcorpan>
s/group/collapse/

[08:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
(in case that page changes: it contains lots of "<a .../><img/></a>" which results in lots of "Stray / in tag." and "An a start tag seen with already an active a element." messages)

[09:08:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: feature request recorded. However, I probably won't be implementing the requested feature any time soon, because Validator.nu doesn't have the concept of "same type" and the whole architecture is designed to assume that such grouping is unwanted

[09:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
so introducing the feature inside Validator.nu wouldn't be much easier than writing a separate front end that called Validator.nu using the Web service API and did the sorting

[09:09:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: it could be javascript

[09:10:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: true. I hadn't though of that

[09:10:01.0000] <zcorpan>
btw, do you think it would be useful for you if the PFWG produced schemas for XHTML+ARIA?

[09:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: which XHTML?

[09:12:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: which schema language?

[09:12:01.0000] <zcorpan>
not sure

[09:12:02.0000] <hsivonen>
I'm probably going to write XHTML5+ARIA in due course

[10:14:00.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: yt?

[10:15:00.0000] <Lachy>
y

[10:16:00.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: do you think http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTML/Guide/ is an appropriate place for an overview of <canvas>?

[10:16:01.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: should the offline apps overview be merged in as well?

[10:18:00.0000] <Lachy>
aroben, if it's something that would be suitable for the Web Dev's Guide to HTML 5, then sure

[10:19:00.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: the offline apps overview is certainly something that developers will want to read, though I don't think it's developer-specific

[10:20:00.0000] <Lachy>
are you talking about an overview that already exists somewhere?

[10:20:01.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: for offline apps, yes

[10:21:00.0000] <Lachy>
link?

[10:21:01.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: Hixie and anne wrote it

[10:21:02.0000] <aroben>
/me finds it

[10:21:03.0000] <Lachy>
this thing http://dev.w3.org/html5/offline-webapps/ ?

[10:21:04.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: yes

[10:25:00.0000] <Lachy>
it might be suitable, I'll have to think about it. I wasn't intending to look at that stuff for quite a while and will focus on the more stable sections

[10:26:00.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: I was thinking about starting to write a <canvas> overview, and so I wanted to figure out if I should just do it within the developer's guide

[10:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
aroben: Do you have ideas of what the overview would include? (I think duplicating the tutorial content that's already on the Mozilla wiki wouldn't be useful, but there are other things that aren't clearly written anywhere yet (as far as I'm aware))

[10:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
is there a vector PDF whatwg logo available?

[10:32:01.0000] <aroben>
Philip`: I've only just started thinking about it

[10:33:00.0000] <aroben>
Philip`: existing documents I'm aware of are

[10:33:01.0000] <aroben>
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Drawing_Graphics_with_Canvas

[10:33:02.0000] <aroben>

[10:34:00.0000] <aroben>
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariJSRef/Classes/Canvas.html

[10:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
aroben: Okay - I can't think of any other relevant documents except for scattered pieces in blogs and mailing lists

[10:37:01.0000] <Lachy>
aroben, you're welcome to contribute stuff about canvas if you like

[10:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
Oh, there's also some book stuff like http://safari.oreilly.com/0596102437/html_canvas which I can't read

[10:43:00.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: thanks, I guess we can always separate it out if we think that's more appropriate

[10:43:01.0000] <aroben>
Lachy: but I'd like to err on the side of fewer documents

[11:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: no special feature, just some shapes

[11:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: ok seems tedious. I implemented each year as a slide

[11:33:00.0000] <gsnedders>
/me draws a circle around Hixie, and a square around hsivonen 

[11:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
(aside: I'm in awe over the level of suckiness of Keynote's chart tools and even more in awe over the suckiness of Numbers in general when trying to make something to paste to Keynote)

[11:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: oh it was _very_ tedious

[11:40:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: but it worked much better (imho) to have it all on one screen

[11:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: what version?

[11:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: '08

[11:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: ah. well. compared to v1, believe me, '08 is a dream.

[11:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
hsivonen: (also a dream compared to ppt)

[12:02:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hrm. Safari does not print SVG

[12:03:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Minefield print SVG but as bitmaps

[12:04:00.0000] <hsivonen>
and Opera crashes printing SVG

[12:05:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Prince to rescue

[12:10:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Safari doesn't print SVG?

[12:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
/me is mildly surprised

[12:11:00.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: well, at least does not preview or save as PDF

[12:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
does it refuse, or does the PDF come out blank?

[12:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
othermaciej: comes out blank

[14:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
sure are a lot of odd things on *.com.com subdomains

what on earth is http://www2.2ch.net/snow/index.js

[15:02:00.0000] <Hixie>
an analytics script, it seems

[15:02:01.0000] <Hixie>
how weird

[15:12:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It's also supposed to be shift-jis, for what it matters

[15:14:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
there's a whole lot of weirdness on 2ch.net

[15:14:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
if Jorge Luis Borges were still alive he could write a great story about it

/me stares at http://engine.cqvip.com/content/script/mainfuncation.js is confusion

[15:53:00.0000] <Hixie>
what on earth is <script src=poem.js></script> used for

[15:56:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, where is poem.js used?

[15:56:01.0000] <gavin>
did you mean to give the URL?

[15:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
lachy: i don't know.

[15:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: google searches suggest arabic bulletin boards.

[15:59:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok. Then how is anyone supposed to know what that script is used for without seeing it in context?

[15:59:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's often quite easy

[15:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
e.g. if i ask what jquery.js is for, everyone knows :-)


2007-11-27
[16:00:00.0000] <Lachy>
yeah, but that's a popular library with a unique name

[16:00:01.0000] <Hixie>
it seems poem.js is also popular

[16:00:02.0000] <Hixie>
but i've never heard of it before

[16:01:00.0000] <Lachy>
it's also a common word, so maybe people are just calling different scripts the same thing

[16:01:01.0000] <Hixie>
possible, but it seems not in this case, at least not based on the google searches i did

[16:01:02.0000] <Hixie>
all i could find was people talking about it on arabic bulletin boards

[16:02:00.0000] <Lachy>
anyway, I'm having troubles of my own.  Copying and pasting from iWork Pages into Dreamweaver is not as simple and convenient as it is from MS Word

[16:02:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://swalfna.com/dewan/poem.js

[16:02:02.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: wow, how do you do that

[16:02:03.0000] <Philip`>
and http://www.dardasha.net/images/poem.js etc

[16:02:04.0000] <Philip`>
http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=%22poem.js%22 ;-)

[16:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
cunning!

[16:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
it does seem to be all the same script

[16:04:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone speak arabic here? :-)

[16:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i don't suppose you have any luck with /en/pages/js/Abstract.js ? :-)

[16:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://ci.nii.ac.jp/en/pages/js/Abstract.js ?

[16:08:01.0000] <Philip`>
(That's all http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=en%2Fpages%2Fjs%2FAbstract.js finds)

[16:09:00.0000] <Hixie>
clearly i need to start using msn search and yahoo search more

[16:14:00.0000] <Philip`>
Sadly Google is not perfect :-(

[16:15:00.0000] <Hixie>
:-)

[16:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
indeed not

[16:20:00.0000] <roc>
Hixie: smontagu on Mozilla IRC can help you with arabic

[16:20:01.0000] <Hixie>
aah, cool

[16:20:02.0000] <roc>
... when he's around

[16:20:03.0000] <roc>
he lives in Israel so he's hardly ever awake when I am :-)

:-)

[02:23:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: does mediawiki have some kind of extension system? I'm not seeing the same UI on wiki.whatwg.org that I'm seeing in mediawiki docs

[02:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
in particular, I don't see a button for creating a table

[02:24:00.0000] <Lachy>
yes, there are extensions available for it

[02:24:01.0000] <Lachy>
if you find one you want, I can install it for you

[02:26:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Special:Version lists the extensions installed. Check that page on the other wiki to see what they're using

[02:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: ok. I'll just use the syntax manually

[06:31:00.0000] <Lachy>
does anyone know where in the whatwg archives the rationale for dropping <h> is described?

[06:35:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-November/002362.html ?

[06:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
thanks.

[06:42:00.0000] <Lachy>
I'll post that to public-html later (unless someone else does it)

[06:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
I gotta go, cya

[12:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://scripts.lycos.com/catman/init.js <-- the first statement in that file is a classic example of cargo-cult programming

[12:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: what's the expected magic?

[12:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
that it won't break parsers

[12:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's from people finding that "</script>" in an inline script breaks parsers

[12:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
so people instead of just writing "<\/script>" write "</scr"+"ipt>"

[12:42:01.0000] <Hixie>
and in this instance, it has gotten so far as "scr"+"ipt" in an external script

[12:42:02.0000] <hsivonen>
ok

[12:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I find the use of the $ sign weird, too, but I guess the $ is just a valid identifier character

[12:44:00.0000] <takkaria>
hsivonen: PHP influence, I guess

[12:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
/me guessed Perl instead

[12:47:00.0000] <Philip`>
I like being able to write "var π = 3.14"

[12:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
(Java is nice like that too)

[13:23:00.0000] <Hixie>
interesting

[13:23:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm seeing a lot of dm_client... scripts

[13:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
seems to be related to REVENUE SCIENCE

[13:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
whatever that is

[13:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
lots of people complaining about cookies...

[13:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
hmm http://www.revenuescience.com/

[14:05:00.0000] <jacobolus>
Hixie: in <http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml>, <http://www.hut.fi/u/hsivonen/xhtml-the-point> should be changed to <http://hsivonen.iki.fi/xhtml-the-point/>

[14:05:01.0000] <jacobolus>
(in case you're still updating that thing)

[14:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
i have several million pages in my survey who have <script src="javascript/quick_review.js"> and yet i can't find anything in any of the three search engines to tell me what that might be about

[14:17:01.0000] <Hixie>
jacobolus: k, thanks

[14:28:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me is surprised by how many search engines are just wrappers around Google/Yahoo/Ask

[14:30:00.0000] <Philip`>
All the familiar names from last century are now mere shells :-(

[14:33:00.0000] <jacobolus>
altavista seems to still exist

[14:33:01.0000] <jacobolus>
though half the page is "sponsored" matches

[14:33:02.0000] <jacobolus>
oh, i guess they use yahoo!

[14:33:03.0000] <kingryan>
jacobolus: altavista is owned by yahoo and uses most of the same technology

[14:33:04.0000] <jacobolus>
nevermind

[14:35:00.0000] <jacobolus>
i wonder what the point of that is

[14:35:01.0000] <jacobolus>
i.e. having a separate page which looks different, but is actually just yahoo

[14:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://www.alltheweb.com/ is just Yahoo too

[14:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
I guess the point is that people who use one search engine will continue using that search engine since it's what they know, and if Yahoo buys that search engine then they don't want to maintain two different technologies but they don't want to lose any of the existing users, so they keep the old branding

[14:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
i really can't find anything about this quick_review.js thing

[14:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
weird

[14:50:00.0000] <Philip`>
When you're collecting the list of frequently-used scripts, could you make it remember the page where it was found (and do that randomly in 1 in 10^5 occurrences, so you'll not have so much data but will have some pointers to things used a million times)?

[14:50:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'd have to have the list of frequently used scripts first

[14:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
which poses a chicken and egg problem

[14:51:01.0000] <Hixie>
(otherwise i'd just have to remember every script, which would be insane)

[14:52:00.0000] <kingryan>
Hixie: you have an example of this js file?

[14:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
no

[14:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
that's the problem

[14:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
You wouldn't need the list of frequent scripts first - if there's a tiny random chance of remembering the page each time you see a script, then non-frequent scripts will have a very low chance of you ever remembering a page they were on, whereas frequent scripts will have a high chance, so it will all work out sensibly as long as you're not unlucky :-)

[14:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
I wonder how long it will take until google starts searching SVG now that 3 out of the top 4 browsers support it

[14:54:00.0000] <Hixie>
Philip`: i can't do anything non-deterministic, since i have to be able to rerun any particular scan of any page with reliably the same results

[14:56:00.0000] <Philip`>
if (md5(uri) < 2^128 / 10^5) { remember uri }

[14:56:01.0000] <Hixie>
the uri's always the same, that's the problem :-)

[14:57:00.0000] <Hixie>
(i could base it on the page's url, i guess, but that still seems somewhat dodgy)

[14:57:01.0000] <Hixie>
it'll be easier just to special case the few uris i actually need to look for

[14:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
(I was thinking of 'uri' being of the page, so it would occasionally store the (page uri, script uri) pairs, as well as doing the normal counting of all script uri values)

[14:59:01.0000] <Philip`>
(and then it would only need a single pass)

[14:59:02.0000] <Hixie>
yeah

[14:59:03.0000] <Hixie>
it's not a bad idea

[15:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think it's crazy but maybe it'd work anyway :-)

[15:40:00.0000] <gsnedders>
how awesome.

[15:41:00.0000] <gsnedders>
people are already finding my site searching for "http parsing specification"

[15:41:01.0000] <gsnedders>
The number of such referrals shows that people really do want such a thing

[15:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
anyone know what crux.js might be for?

[15:48:01.0000] <Hixie>
(<script src="js/Crux/crux.js"></script>)


2007-11-28
[17:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
<script src="/static/affiliate_base/js/base.js"> anyone?

[17:30:00.0000] <Hixie>
or <script src="/j-east/js/form.js"> ?

[17:32:00.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, base.js could be Dean Edward's base.js script

[17:32:01.0000] <kingryan>
Hixie: I take it that your test environment doesn't give you access to the url of the markup source?

[17:32:02.0000] <kingryan>
Lachy: I doubt it, given the 'affiliate_base'

[17:32:03.0000] <Hixie>
lachy: i found a version with that path here: http://www.booking.com/static/affiliate_base/js/base.js -- my working assumption right now is that it's a booking.com-specific script

[17:33:00.0000] <Lachy>
ok

[17:33:01.0000] <Lachy>
Hixie, what's your purpose in looking at all of these scripts?

[17:33:02.0000] <Hixie>
kingryan: sadly, no, one of the problems with scanning billions of documents is that you have to throw out a lot of data lest you just output terabytes and terabytes of data

[17:34:00.0000] <kingryan>
but google has terabytes of storeage to spare, right? :)

[17:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy: twofold; trying to see what libraries are out there and widely used, and trying to see what things are commonly done to get an idea of where we need to work on in the future to make APIs better

[17:34:02.0000] <Lachy>
/me believes Google has infinite storage :-)

[17:35:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's not quite that easy :-)

[17:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
woot, found one j-east/js/form.js: http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/js/form.js

[01:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hmm. 66 messages in the www-style @ua thread...

[01:47:00.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, was that thread just rehashing all the arguments for adding browser sniffing to css?

[01:47:01.0000] <Lachy>
I didn't bother reading it, since it didn't seem like anything new

[01:48:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: yes, but I haven't read it properly.

[01:49:00.0000] <othermaciej>
browser sniffing sucks, but not having it also sucks

[01:50:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: is there something interesting going on in www-style? i'm not subscribed

[01:50:01.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, not much

[01:50:02.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: ok

[01:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
dbaron's review of hyatt's CSS transforms / animations proposal was interesting

[01:51:01.0000] <Lfe>
othermaciej: url?

[01:52:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Lfe: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Nov/0223.html

[01:52:01.0000] <Lfe>
othermaciej: thanks!

[01:52:02.0000] <othermaciej>
(see thread for original proposal)

[01:52:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I have a neat demo of that stuff which I should post

[01:53:00.0000] <Lfe>
That i've read, havent followed the discussion though.

[01:53:01.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: the most interesting things in general are the Apple proposals othermaciej mentioned. (personally, I should follow up to some of the media query validation issues)

[01:53:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: k

[04:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
oh great. the data URI ;base64 doesn't appear to allow white space between ; and b

[04:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
yay for consistent parsing

[05:18:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Are we forcing compliant browsers to accept data URIs? That'd be a first for MSIE.

[05:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
OmegaJunior: I expect not

[05:28:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Ah, too bad.

[05:34:00.0000] <hsivonen>
does anyone remember if Python urllib2 requests gzip compression?

[05:35:00.0000] <OmegaJunior>
Sorry no, never worked with it.

[05:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
apparently, no

[05:36:01.0000] <hsivonen>
:-(

[08:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh. firefox doesn't ignore the mime type with xml-stylesheet

[08:10:01.0000] <zcorpan>
(but everyone else does)

[08:11:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me changes the spec to make xml-stylesheet honor mime type

[08:15:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me also finds that safari supports "inline" stylesheets á la <?xml-stylesheet href="#a"?><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="a">p { background:yellow }</p>

[08:16:00.0000] <zcorpan>
s/á/à/

[08:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
wonder if i should require that to work

[08:23:00.0000] <gsnedders>
zcorpan: what about xml:id?

[08:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
nope

[08:25:01.0000] <zcorpan>
seems webkit doesn't support xml:id at all

[10:08:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/specs/xml-stylesheet5 now features entities

[10:09:00.0000] <anne-mac>
I don't think we should add the stuff btw that only WebKit supports

[10:09:01.0000] <anne-mac>
The additional complexity has no real use case as far as I can tell

[10:10:00.0000] <zcorpan>
ok

[10:11:00.0000] <gsnedders>
I expect from the face of it that it's just due to how it is implemented and not intentional

[10:11:01.0000] <anne-mac>
The entity stuff doesn't handle EOF

[10:11:02.0000] <zcorpan>
EOF will be part of the entity table lookup

[10:12:00.0000] <zcorpan>
no?

[10:12:01.0000] <zcorpan>
gsnedders: don't think so

[10:12:02.0000] <anne-mac>
it's not at all clear what should happen when you hit a parse error

[10:13:00.0000] <zcorpan>
doesn't really matter

[10:13:01.0000] <anne-mac>
besides marking the pseudo-attribute as being in error

[10:13:02.0000] <zcorpan>
the pseudo-attribute will be dropped later on

[10:13:03.0000] <zcorpan>
so what the value is doesn't matter

[10:14:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but the number of consumed characters matters if you've consumed a " or '

[10:15:00.0000] <anne-mac>
you can't consume those per the current algorithm, so I guess you're correct

[10:15:01.0000] <zcorpan>
i guess i could deal with ', " and EOF up front to make the spec clearer?

[10:15:02.0000] <zcorpan>
right

[10:16:00.0000] <anne-mac>
"Otherwise, if the next character is a U+003B SEMICOLON, consume that too." is slightly confusing as it doesn't directly follow from the if statement before

[10:16:01.0000] <zcorpan>
also applies to html5, in that case :)

[10:16:02.0000] <zcorpan>
/me ripped most off

[10:17:00.0000] <anne-mac>
XSLT processing rules is inside <code>

[10:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oops

[10:18:01.0000] <anne-mac>
"(i.e., had the MIME type text/css)" seems also wrong given the statement before it

[10:19:00.0000] <anne-mac>
(i.e., had the MIME type text/plain instead of text/css) would be better

[10:19:01.0000] <anne-mac>
the DOM3Views reference should be DOM2Views

[10:20:00.0000] <anne-mac>
and Acknowledgements should be spelled Acknowledgments per en-US

[10:23:00.0000] <zcorpan>
fixed. thanks

[10:25:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it seems that implementations treat &#x01; as a parse error. but i'm not sure it's that important. and other values aren't interoperable, like ffff or 110000

[10:26:00.0000] <zcorpan>
so i just aligned with html5

[10:27:00.0000] <anne-mac>
html5 will change methinks

[10:27:01.0000] <zcorpan>
to what?

[10:27:02.0000] <anne-mac>
not sure, surrogate characters will have to be dealt with somehow, at least

[10:28:00.0000] <zcorpan>
oh yep

[10:29:00.0000] <anne-mac>
"(in other words, 0-9, A-F, a-f)" is not in the same order as the stuff before it and misses "and"

[10:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
fixed. also in html5

[10:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
a surrogate is not a parse error in firefox

[10:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
though i think i'll leave it for now

[10:37:00.0000] <zcorpan>
a fun feature (not in the spec currently) is that you can point to the file itself and let it act as a style sheet

[10:38:00.0000] <zcorpan>
since <!-- is a valid css token you can have your style rules in a comment in the prolog

[10:39:00.0000] <anne-mac>
that's more or less disabled by doing media type checking

[10:39:01.0000] <zcorpan>
indeed

[10:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but it works in webkit and ie

[10:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/test/xml/xml-stylesheet/css/019.xml

[10:42:00.0000] <csarven>
thats cool

[10:43:00.0000] <anne-mac>
also works in Opera

[10:43:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ah yep. though not in 9.2x it seems

[10:44:00.0000] <anne-mac>
/me is playing with Opera 9.5 Beta on MacOS X

[10:44:01.0000] <anne-mac>
9.50, even

[10:58:00.0000] <anne-mac>
btw, if Content-Type is honered you don't have to default to CSS anymore in theory

[10:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
it's only honored after type="" has had it's say

[10:59:01.0000] <anne-mac>
that's how it currently works in Firefox?

[10:59:02.0000] <zcorpan>
1) type="" decides if you're gonna do css processing, xslt processing, or ignore the PI altogether

[11:00:00.0000] <zcorpan>
2) the mime type decides if you're gonna apply the resource at all

[11:00:01.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[11:00:02.0000] <anne-mac>
in that case 2) seems like a needless step

[11:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah, but people don't like it when content-type is ignored

[11:03:00.0000] <anne-mac>
hmm

[11:30:00.0000] <zcorpan>
one thing i wonder. should it be possible to insert a ProcessingInstruction node to the DOM in html?

[11:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
dom core says no, and firefox and webkit don't allow it

[11:31:01.0000] <zcorpan>
but i don't see a good reason for it

[11:32:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or well, i know the reason; that implementations at the time didn't support it declaratively in html

[11:33:00.0000] <zcorpan>
but doing different things in the dom based on the htmlness flag sucks

[11:33:01.0000] <zcorpan>
anyway. gotta go

[13:07:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow

[13:07:01.0000] <Hixie>
what an interesting precedent was just set

[13:07:02.0000] <Hixie>
i look forward to making arbitrary decisions and invoking the secret opinions of anonymous contributors to back me up

[13:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
Like the 10% of emails in your issues list that are private?

[13:11:00.0000] <Hixie>
they're only private because they were sent directly to me (or to a nonpublic list like mozilla-security), if someone said something that disagreed with an e-mail in that list i couldn't let the anonymous hidden mail override the other feedback

[13:11:01.0000] <Hixie>
there has to be some accountability

[13:31:00.0000] <gsnedders>
Hixie: what precedent? where?

[13:32:00.0000] <hober>

ruby1: sam?

[17:46:00.0000] <ruby1>
yes, can't seem to get rubys at the moment

[17:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
hey dude

[17:47:00.0000] <Hixie>
i was wondering if you were aware that DanC was using your objections on <canvas> as a reason not to publish html5 as a working draft:

[17:47:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2007Nov/0416.html

[17:48:00.0000] <Hixie>
...and whether, if that wasn't intentional, you could let the htmlwg know you didn't mean to imply that we shouldn't publish :-)

[17:48:01.0000] <othermaciej>
hey ruby1

[17:48:02.0000] <ruby1>
I'm torn.  I do believe in release early and often.  And I'm also keenly aware that there are scope issues that need to be resolved sooner than later.

[17:49:00.0000] <ruby1>
maciej: why "other"?

[17:49:01.0000] <othermaciej>
ruby1: because someone else has "maciej" registered on this server

[17:50:00.0000] <rubys>
was able to "ghost" rubys.  Much better.

[17:51:00.0000] <rubys>
I'll post a response to Dan on the subject tomorrow.

[17:51:01.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: much appreciated

[17:52:00.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: cool, thanks

[17:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: i would be interested in hearing why you weren't convinced by the arguments that <canvas> is within the scope of html5 according to the charter, btw (e.g. those maciej wrote in: http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/tactics-gapi-canvas/results )

[17:54:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh yeah, I would too, if you are indeed not convinced

[17:58:00.0000] <rubys>
I'll provide a more complete answer in my post, but the short version is (1) by that reasoning SVG is in scope, (2) those that are working on the charter don't need to impact the people working on the spec (a point which I realize is partially invalidated by the fact that publishing this draft is on hold), and (3) I think namespaces are reasonable, so I guess that's in too?  #3 is the most important issue.  Charters aren't important when pe

[18:00:00.0000] <hober>
cut off at "when pe", btw

[18:01:00.0000] <rubys>
Charters aren't important when people agree, they are only important when people disagree.

[18:02:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Sounds like we might need the entire spec in the charter for this wg then :)

[18:03:00.0000] <hober>
I really doubt your #2 -- I suspect rechartering would be a giant time-sink political mess which would necessarily drag everyone into it

[18:04:00.0000] <hober>
Agreed on #1 -- I expect <canvas> and SVG to both be included

[18:04:01.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: I do think SVG integration is in scope - I hope you do too

[18:05:00.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: I also think namespaces are in scope (indeed, some mechanism to embed foreign languages is required, though the requirement is not specifically for namespaces)

[18:06:00.0000] <rubys>
if we can agree on those things, then they should be mentioned in the charter too.  I'm not hopeful that we can agree on those things yet.

[18:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: "The HTML WG is encouraged to provide a mechanism to permit independently developed vocabularies such as Internationalization Tag Set (ITS), Ruby, and RDFa to be mixed into HTML documents. Whether this occurs through the extensibility mechanism of XML, whether it is also allowed in the classic HTML serialization, and whether it uses the DTD and Schema modularization techniques, is for the HTML WG to determine."

[18:07:01.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: that pretty clearly puts SVG integration and namespaces in scope

[18:07:02.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: (though it does not specifically require either)

[18:08:00.0000] <rubys>
maciej: where are you quoting from?

[18:09:00.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: the HTML Working Group charter

[18:09:01.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.w3.org/2007/03/HTML-WG-charter.html

[18:09:02.0000] <rubys>
oops, I was looking at the wrong page for a moment

[18:09:03.0000] <othermaciej>
there are many old versions on the Google

[18:10:00.0000] <rubys>
"whether it is also allowed in the classic HTML serialization, ..., is for the HTML WG to determine." <= that's the part that I'm not hopeful on.

[18:10:01.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, I think that charter clause as written is better than an exhaustive and exclusive list of languages to integrate, or a specific requirement to use the namespace syntax

[18:11:00.0000] <rubys>
that's a low bar.

[18:11:01.0000] <othermaciej>
since it gives us leeway to study the technical issues

[18:11:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think nearly all WG members are in favor of integration of at least some specific languages with some syntax

[18:11:03.0000] <othermaciej>
I would guess most are in favor of SVG being one of these

[18:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
and I think that many would favor or at least not object to an open-ended extensibility mechanism, likely compatible with Namespaces in XML

[18:12:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I am personally pro all three of those things

[18:12:02.0000] <rubys>
An exclusive list or prematurely setting on a specific syntax are both non-starters.  Agreeing to allow other vocabularies -- some that may be known today, and some that may not -- is something that I don't see agreement on.

[18:12:03.0000] <othermaciej>
although on the namespace syntax there are many devilish details to work out

[18:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think there is some disagreement on whether extensibility needs to be open-ended or just support a fixed list of additional vocabularies

[18:13:01.0000] <othermaciej>
but I do not think the charter process is the best way to come to consensus on that point

[18:14:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I personally would like to take a stab at proposing an approach to namespaces that can have decent degradation and cross-XML/Classic properties when I have time

[18:15:00.0000] <rubys>
hopefully more people will comment on the proposal that you come up with than have commented on mine.

[18:15:01.0000] <Hixie>
it's still on my list of things to look at :-)

[18:16:00.0000] <othermaciej>
rubys: I did comment on one of yours at some point

[18:16:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I think we may need a couple of different proposals on the table to compare and contrast

[18:17:00.0000] <othermaciej>
cause there are tradeoffs here

[18:17:01.0000] <rubys>
discussion is good.

[18:17:02.0000] <Hixie>
rubys: (sorry, was getting dinner. i didn't really follow how your comments above (1,2,3) lead to you thinking <canvas> wasn't covered by the points in the charter that maciej lists as being ways in which <canvas> is covered, though, fwiw.)

[18:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
anyway, addressing the foreign syntax issue is one of the few significant feature additions I really want to see

[18:19:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(for whatever my opinion's worth)

[18:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip` - any chance you might be awake right now?

[18:52:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
/me wonders if there might be any canvas interoperability reports around other than Philip`'s

[18:52:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/tests/tests/results.html

[19:03:00.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.michaelsalamon.com/?p=20 is probably worth bearing in mind

[19:03:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm sure i'm guilty of such problems in html5 :-/

[19:03:02.0000] <Hixie>
(like maybe the inline/block stuff, i dunno)

[19:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: style attribute :-)

[19:32:00.0000] <Hixie>
yeah well that's an open issue

[19:32:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm still considering having two levels of conformance, one for final production-level code and one for experimentation, one-offs, etc

[19:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
/me points to the picture

[19:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
the difference here is that there are real benefits to not using media-specific inline styling

[19:57:00.0000] <othermaciej>
delete the word inline and I'll agree

[19:57:01.0000] <othermaciej>
add an explanation of how to distinguish media-specific styling from media-independent styling and I'll agree you have a potentially worthwhile conformance requirement

[19:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
bonus points for explaining how this page would be improved by not using the style attribute: http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/

[20:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
(alternatives I have seen include nesting em tags (ugh) and defining a class for each size and just using a less continuous size scale (also kinda ugh)

[20:03:00.0000] <othermaciej>
if you add a fine color grade as well, then the class approach becomes untenable

[20:25:00.0000] <Hixie>
othermaciej: why is nesting tags (not necessarily <em>) bad?

[20:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: makes the markup fugly, and more painful to generate programatically

[20:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Hixie: also takes more bandwidth

[20:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
but style="" is better in that respect?

[20:26:02.0000] <othermaciej>
especially if you go up to, like, 20 levels

[20:26:03.0000] <othermaciej>
sure, if I want to make a tagcloud on a log/log scale of frequency I can generate an int scaled to the right range and happily slap it into a style attribute

[20:27:00.0000] <othermaciej>
wrapping in 20 <em>s is more unpleasant both to read and write

[20:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
also no good for a color grade

[20:27:02.0000] <Hixie>
hmm

[20:27:03.0000] <othermaciej>
unless you write totally insane style rules with one per nesting level

[20:27:04.0000] <Hixie>
wonder how to address this

[20:27:05.0000] <Hixie>
it's totally clear to me that style="" is a terrible way of doing this, but i agree that it may be the better way (for a colour grand, at least)

[20:29:00.0000] <othermaciej>
also if it is nonconforming at the DOM level too (not sure if the HTML5 spec defines conforming post-parse DOMs) then you can't do foo.style.left="4px" or whatever

[20:29:01.0000] <othermaciej>
since that creates a style attribute if you did not have one

[20:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i'm not convinced .style.foo = '' is good style either

[20:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
but that's another story

[20:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't expect to win any battles on that front any time soon

[21:01:00.0000] <markp>

[21:02:00.0000] <markp>
/me wanders off mumbling "to the fairest" under his breath

[21:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
interesting that Doug writes "The only character encoding permitted in [in my proposed version of] HTML 5 is UTF-8." but he has <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"> in the source for the doc..

[00:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: There wasn't much chance, and I went to bed early anyway

[00:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
I'm not aware of any other canvas interoperability reports

[00:04:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
OK

[00:05:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I had mistakenly thought your report didn't cover Webkit

[00:05:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
but Maciej pointed out to me that it did

[00:05:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
after he had manually run through all the test cases

[00:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
with results that turn out to align pretty much with the results in your report

[00:06:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
see earlier discussion over on #webkit

[00:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
Okay - those results are just hidden in the column with heading "...AppleWebKit..." :-)

[00:15:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip` - yeah, I drank too much breakfast beer this morning before screwing my head back on

[00:15:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
feeling better now

[00:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
The test report thing at http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/tests/reportgenentry.html ought to make it easy to collect results, except it's not really designed to be usable by anyone other than me, so I should probably fix that at some point

[00:18:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip` - Maciej said "fwiw it's not unlikey we will implement those two features in the not-too-distant future and also go over the tests and fix our implementation or try to get the spec fixed as appropriate"

[00:18:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
so maybe would be worthwhile for them

[00:18:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
I dunno

[00:18:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
anyway, thanks for making that report

[00:19:00.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: how do I use it?

[00:19:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
it's very useful to have something referenceable to cite

[00:19:02.0000] <othermaciej>
oh, I see

[00:19:03.0000] <othermaciej>
Philip`: does more than 150 items per page make Safari sad?

[00:19:04.0000] <Philip`>
There's a couple of tests that I know are wrong, and haven't got around to re-uploading yet, but otherwise it ought to be about correct

[00:20:00.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: Yes - when I last looked, WebKit had a hardcoded limit of 200 frames per document

[00:21:00.0000] <othermaciej>
oh

[00:21:01.0000] <othermaciej>
we could probably relax that now

[00:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
(There were several other bugs with Safari (on Windows) when I first did this, hence the comment on the reportgen page about WebKit problems, but I think things worked much better when I last tried it)

[00:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
(It's still incredibly painful to run the tests with Opera Mini, though)

[00:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me should try testing all the browsers on all the platforms to see if they're doing anything funny

[00:27:01.0000] <othermaciej>
I'd be curious if there are any Safari discrepancies between Mac and Win

[00:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I am not sure any of the Linux WebKit ports are ready for prime time though

[00:28:01.0000] <othermaciej>
(yet)

[00:29:00.0000] <Philip`>
There were significant differences in e.g. radial gradients between Safari 3 on Windows and Safari 3 on OSX 10.4, presumably because that's handled by system libraries instead of by WebKit, so maybe they're the same now on 10.5

[00:30:00.0000] <othermaciej>
might be so

[00:31:00.0000] <Philip`>
(If I remember correctly, http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/tests/tests/2d.gradient.radial.inside3.html was an odd reddish-green shade on Windows, but worked correctly with the same WebKit on 10.4)

[00:36:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip` - btw, http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/83/play.xhtml doesn't seem to display as expected in current Webkit nightly

[00:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Is the game view pushed down below the ugly brown border, or is it something else?

[00:45:00.0000] <othermaciej>
it's an odd reddish green in Safari 3 on Mac

[00:45:01.0000] <othermaciej>
the view is pushed down

[00:45:02.0000] <othermaciej>
I think that bug might be filed in bugs.webkit.org but not sure

[00:46:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13538

[00:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
othermaciej: Okay, sounds like that's the same bug I see on Windows, so at least it's consistent when using the latest versions :-)

[00:49:00.0000] <Philip`>
Looks quite similar to http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16045

[00:51:00.0000] <othermaciej>
sounds like

[00:56:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip` - just the gamed pushed below the border

[00:56:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
that's all

[00:56:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
otherwise works fine for me

[00:56:03.0000] <MikeSmith>
as far as the behavior

[00:59:00.0000] <othermaciej>
the game itself plays quite smoothly in Safari

[01:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
I think I don't even have any WebKit-specific hacks in there, whereas I do for Firefox and Opera, but maybe that's just because I couldn't test it in WebKit until after the WebKit developers had already fixed the bugs

[02:16:00.0000] <hsivonen>

[03:19:00.0000] <hsivonen>
too bad that it will be tedious to catch when it happens midway a document of the size of the HTML5 spec

[03:27:01.0000] <hendry>
wtf is Mozilla doing with <video>. they seem to be dragging their heels with HTML5 stuff

[03:29:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: any particular wtf in mind?

[03:33:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: i am not tracking their bts, so i am not sure what's going on

[03:34:00.0000] <hendry>
though I recall asking if video/element would be in firefox 3 and that didn't seem to be happening

[03:34:01.0000] <hendry>
sorry, i should really check myself how far they are on WF2 & video/audio before I bitch :)

[03:37:00.0000] <hendry>
i hate bugzilla. i guess i should read some manual, how to bookmark the bugs I want to see, saved searches isn't cutting it.

[03:40:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: from reading b.m.o, it seems to me that <video> was too late to make it to Firefox 3

[03:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
But I don't work on Firefox, so don't trust me on this point.

[03:44:00.0000] <hendry>
any ideas about WF2? I think WF2 is low hanging fruit, isn't it? There is JS for IE support, no? http://olav.dk/wf2/demo/

[03:44:01.0000] <hendry>
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=345822 a bug I found about WF2 in Firefox

[03:47:00.0000] <hendry>
does that bug make any sense to you guys? 

[03:47:01.0000] <hendry>
oh and there is https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=344614

[03:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: I'm not up to speed with the WF2 situation

[03:50:00.0000] <hendry>
that bug depresses me

[03:50:01.0000] <hendry>
or dissapoints rather :)

[03:56:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hendry: thanks

[04:09:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: fixed: http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fvideo.natalian.org%2F06

[05:23:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: great

[05:24:00.0000] <hendry>
so now all i have is block/inline issues

[05:24:01.0000] <hendry>
i hate the distinction between block/inline. Is there _really_ i need for this distinction or am I asking a really dumb question this lunch time? :)

[05:27:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: you need to discuss the block/inline thing with Hixie

[05:31:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me suspects that block/inline is going to make some authors ignore conf checking altogether

[05:32:00.0000] <hsivonen>
I'd like to see glazou state his block/inline opinions/requirements on public-html

[05:49:00.0000] <hendry>
/me agrees with zcorpan

[05:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
I almost never want to check for conformance, I just want to check for errors, where I define "errors" as anything I did without noticing or without knowing the consequences

[05:53:00.0000] <Philip`>
but the only tools available are validators / conformance checkers, so I have to put up with them not doing exactly what I want them to do

[05:54:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: do you have a precise spec for what you want checked? :-)

[05:55:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: No, since it would involve a tool that could read my mind :-)

[05:55:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: can you validator check for payload? gzip type ??

[05:56:00.0000] <hendry>
sorry my keyb went mad on me. payload size I meant.

[05:56:01.0000] <hendry>
be good if you could link into CSS validators and things like jslint.com too

[05:57:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: request recorded but I didn't understand the question

[05:57:01.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: i think it is useful to know how big your Web page is. And to ensure that something sensible like gzip compression on the server is being utilised

[05:58:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: ah. ok

[05:58:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: the payload size is checked only as a countermeasure agaings DoS

[05:58:02.0000] <hendry>
other components of a web page, like CSS and JavaScript should also be validated and "linted" too somehow.

[05:58:03.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: not in the UI ATM

[05:58:04.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: request recorded

[05:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
hsivonen: There is e.g. http://html5.validator.nu/?doc=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pjt47/ where the conformance checker complains about something that I did intentionally, which makes the tool useless since that stops it looking for anything that I might consider a real error that I would like to fix

[06:00:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Philip`: if we as a group decide that what you are doing is a useful backwards compat design patter, I'd expect Hixie to make it conforming

[06:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
The group's view of what is an error will not always be exactly the same as my view, and I want a tool that exactly reflects my view

[06:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
(at least when I'm being an author - I have different desires when being a user of other people's pages)

[06:04:00.0000] <Lachy>
Philip`, why not use divs instead of span, which would be conforming?

[06:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
Lachy: Because it won't get parsed correctly in Firefox

[06:05:01.0000] <Lachy>
oh, so you're using the span has a compatibility hack

[06:05:02.0000] <Philip`>
Yes

[06:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
so it's not something I'm going to fix in my code, because I put it there intentionally, and it's not helpful for a conformance checker to keep complaining about it

[06:08:00.0000] <Philip`>
I haven't got a clue how/whether it's possible to implement a better approximation to my desires than the current single 'document conformance' concept

[06:10:00.0000] <Philip`>
(so I can't give any constructive suggestions)

[06:12:00.0000] <Philip`>
(and the current approximation isn't necessarily bad, and couldn't necessarily be made better in practice, but it's just not perfect :-) )

[06:23:00.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: could you use the WHATWG favicon on validator? I have so many tabs open nowadays. If things don't have a favicon I'm lost :)

[06:23:01.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: using the WHATWG favicon would be a bad idea, but I think having *a* favicon would be good

[06:24:00.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: recording request

[06:24:01.0000] <nickshanks>
Hixie: are you around?

[06:24:02.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: http://www.favicon.cc/

[06:24:03.0000] <hendry>
hsivonen: why is a bad idea to suggest some sort of affiliation between whatwg and validator.nu?

[06:25:00.0000] <nickshanks>
hsivonen: you might know! did ian (or anyone else) ever write a good piece about the theme of "great URLs never die"

[06:25:01.0000] <nickshanks>
i want to educate some people

[06:25:02.0000] <hsivonen>
nickshanks: TimBL wrote Cool URIs Don't Change

[06:25:03.0000] <nickshanks>
yeah, that'll do

[06:25:04.0000] <hsivonen>
hendry: because the WHATWG doesn't endorse a single validator

[06:36:00.0000] <Philip`>
The WHATWG endorses validators in general, and there's only one in practice, so that sort of counts as an implicit endorsement :-)

[06:53:00.0000] <dglazkov>
hello kind HTML5 folk

[06:54:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hi

[06:54:01.0000] <dglazkov>
a while back, I put together the HTML5 SQL player and posted about it on WHATWG list

[06:54:02.0000] <nickshanks>
what, HTML5 folk?! where?

[06:55:00.0000] <dglazkov>
I haven't heard any response, so I am wondering if it would be a good thing for me to continue improving upon it

[06:56:00.0000] <dglazkov>
my POV is that it's always better to develop/enhance the spec based on an implementation, rather than thin air

[06:57:00.0000] <dglazkov>
but I could be wrong

[06:58:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me shares that POV

[06:59:00.0000] <zcorpan>
though, the sql part of html5 is not my expertise

[07:00:00.0000] <nickshanks>
HTML5 is getting bloated IMO

[07:01:00.0000] <zcorpan>
yeah

[07:01:01.0000] <nickshanks>
SQL should be in a seperate, optional module

[07:01:02.0000] <zcorpan>
moving stuff doesn't reduce bloat, though :)

[07:02:00.0000] <zcorpan>
if the web starts using sql, implementors will have to support sql

[07:02:01.0000] <zcorpan>
no matter where or even whether it is defined

[07:02:02.0000] <nickshanks>
hmm, maybe I should write a web browser that only renders HTML 1.0

[07:02:03.0000] <zcorpan>
how about xhtml2? :)

[07:03:00.0000] <nickshanks>
http://web.nickshanks.com/books/gettinggold.xhtml2

[07:03:01.0000] <nickshanks>
i'm waiting for that URL to begin working one day

[07:05:00.0000] <Philip`>
"Error 404"?

[07:06:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: what's the current best list of what ARIA states apply to which roles

[07:06:01.0000] <nickshanks>
oops, it's hyphenated

[07:06:02.0000] <hsivonen>
?

[07:06:03.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: not sure

[07:09:00.0000] <zcorpan>
perhaps http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/ARIA_to_API_mapping#Role_mappings.2C_with_properties_that_depend_on_the_role

[07:13:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: hmm. that's not normative and it has restrictions that http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-aria-role-20071019/ and http://www.w3.org/TR/aria-state/ do not

[07:13:01.0000] <hsivonen>
have

[07:14:00.0000] <nickshanks>
Philip`: are you a student?

[07:15:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: does "Inherits into Roles" mean that the state or property can also occur directly on those roles?

[07:15:01.0000] <Philip`>
nickshanks: Yes

[07:15:02.0000] <nickshanks>
studying what?

[07:16:00.0000] <Philip`>
Currently doing CS PhD

[07:17:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: don't know, actually

[07:17:01.0000] <nickshanks>
does that entitle you to avoid council tax?

[07:18:00.0000] <zcorpan>
i need to get an understanding of how aria really works, and spec it down

[07:19:00.0000] <Philip`>
nickshanks: I assume so, since I'm not paying any tax at all

[07:19:01.0000] <nickshanks>
i have a CS PhD student who's just moved into my house and i'm wondering if that means i lose my single person discount

[07:38:00.0000] <Philip`>
nickshanks: Hmm, I've got no idea - I'm just living in a college-owned house with other students, and all the details are taken care of by other people :-)

[07:38:01.0000] <nickshanks>
fair enough

[09:26:00.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: About your tactics-gapi-canvas comment: I wouldn't think that OpenGL experts would have much expertise relevant to the current canvas API, since it's quite a different area

[09:27:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip` - that was an indirect comment I was attempting to pass on from other team members

[09:27:01.0000] <Philip`>
(though they would know relevant things for a future 3D canvas API)

[09:27:02.0000] <Philip`>
MikeSmith: Okay

[09:28:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
I hope to get more people on the team to read/review the actual canvas API spec

[09:39:00.0000] <Philip`>
It's harder to review now that it's about maintenance/evolution of the specification of an old technology, and not about the design of something new, so there's all the 'don't break the web' problems that make it hard to change much

[09:41:00.0000] <zcorpan>
'text-indent' doesn't inherit to tables in firefox and ie, apparently

[09:41:01.0000] <Philip`>
but it'd be good to have people look at it if they're aware of what modifications are acceptable

[09:50:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Philip` - yeah. Sorta perhaps indicates the spec and implementations around canvas are of a level of maturity that's a bit beyond what is normally required for publishing as part of a FPWD

[09:50:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
some might say

[10:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me finds another case where Firefox 2 writes random memory contents to a <canvas>, but, given the consequences of the most recent attempt at patching the same kind of bug in FF2, expects it would be safer to not tell anyone about it

[10:06:00.0000] <gavin>
bah!

[10:06:01.0000] <gavin>
you should certainly file a bug about it

[10:06:02.0000] <gavin>
the most recent troubles with the patch for that bug were caused by process issues, not code issues

[10:12:00.0000] <Hixie>
Lachy_: anything useful come out of the telecon?

[10:13:00.0000] <gavin>
Philip`: when you do file it, CC me?

[10:17:00.0000] <Philip`>
gavin: Okay, will do - just trying to implement an exploit for the bug, to make it more fun

[10:18:00.0000] <gavin>
perhaps you should mark the bug security-sensitive

[10:18:01.0000] <gavin>
I forget - did you do that for the last one?

[10:22:00.0000] <Philip`>
"_closedTabs:[{state:{entries:[{url:"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/", children:[], title:"Firefox web browser | Faster, more secure, & customizable", cacheKey:0, ID:1, scroll:"0,0"}], index:1, zoom:1, disallow:"", xultab:"", extData:null, text:""}, ..."

[10:22:01.0000] <Philip`>
I'm guessing web pages shouldn't have access to strings like that

[10:24:00.0000] <Philip`>
Bah, I thought I found another problem but actually it was just dust on my monitor that looked like random pixels

[10:26:00.0000] <gavin>
heh

[10:26:01.0000] <gavin>
Philip`: that's right, web pages don't

[10:26:02.0000] <gavin>
we just use a JSON-like format for serializing to disk

[10:27:00.0000] <Philip`>
gavin: s/don't/shouldn't/ :-p

[10:27:01.0000] <gavin>
I'm telling you that they don't

[10:28:00.0000] <gavin>
if you have evidence otherwise, please to be filing a bug? :)

[10:35:00.0000] <Philip`>
gavin: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=406036

[10:35:01.0000] <Philip`>
I would CC you if I knew what your email address was :-)

[10:35:02.0000] <gavin>
that's OK, I can CC myself

[10:36:00.0000] <gavin>
(gavin.sharp matches me)

[10:37:00.0000] <Philip`>
gavin: I didn't mark the last bug security-sensitive, because I didn't really think about the security issue at first, and then I did realise but couldn't sensitise it myself so someone else did

[10:37:01.0000] <Lfe>
ok

[10:37:02.0000] <gavin>
Philip`: ok

[10:37:03.0000] <Lfe>
oops :o

[10:38:00.0000] <gavin>
/me is put off by a branch build's non-native looking Mac widgets

[10:38:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: i've implemented collapsing of messages for validator.nu with javascript

[10:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: http://simon.html5.org/temp/validator-nu-collapse.html

[10:40:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hmm, but the button's label is wrong :)

[10:41:00.0000] <Lachy>
zcorpan, clicking collapse multiple times has a weird bug

[10:42:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: cool. Thanks.

[10:42:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: now why would you do that ;)

[10:43:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: I will look into integrating this

[10:43:01.0000] <Lachy>
I thought it would toggle it

[10:43:02.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: is this under the MIT license?

[10:43:03.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: if it helps :)

[10:43:04.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: it would

[10:43:05.0000] <zcorpan>
then it is

[10:44:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: excellent. Thank you

[10:44:01.0000] <Lachy>
hsivonen, I spoke to DanC earlier about the licence for the authoring guide

[10:44:02.0000] <zcorpan>
do i need to include a boilerplate?

[10:44:03.0000] <hendry>
is this old news? http://www.crockford.com/html/

[10:44:04.0000] <Lachy>
he assigned anne to look into the issue

[10:44:05.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: preferably, yes, so I don't misrepresent anything by adding it myself

[10:45:00.0000] <gavin>
/me apologizes for spamming Philip` with bugmail

[10:45:01.0000] <zcorpan>
pointer to such a boilerplate, please?

hsivonen, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/2007OctDec/0007

[10:46:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy: excellent

[10:46:01.0000] <Philip`>
gavin: No problem, I tend to ignore that email address anyway :-)

[10:47:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: with JS-compatible comments: http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/apidocs/src-html/nu/validator/htmlparser/common/DoctypeExpectation.html

[10:48:00.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: ok, added

[10:49:00.0000] <hsivonen>
zcorpan: thank you

[10:50:00.0000] <nickshanks>
sometimes i hate google

[10:50:01.0000] <nickshanks>
it always ranks my website too high

[10:50:02.0000] <Hixie>
i know the problem

[10:50:03.0000] <nickshanks>
http://images.google.com/images?q=keyboard+layout

[10:51:00.0000] <zcorpan>
Lachy: bug fixed

[10:51:01.0000] <hsivonen>
nickshanks: yeah, that has interesting effects. like people asking me about Japanese fonts

[10:51:02.0000] <gsnedders>
peh. take a look at http://google.com/search?q=homophobic+insults

[10:51:03.0000] <gsnedders>
I'm the second result (or I was a few days ago)!

[10:51:04.0000] <nickshanks>
heh

[10:52:00.0000] <Philip`>
http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/ was high on the image search for "periodic table" a while ago

[10:52:01.0000] <nickshanks>
thing is this costs me money because i've gone way over my bandwidth limits this month

[10:52:02.0000] <zcorpan>
nickshanks: Disallow /

[10:52:03.0000] <zcorpan>
or is it Disallow: /

[10:53:00.0000] <nickshanks>
there's apachectl stop

[10:53:01.0000] <nickshanks>
which saves even more

[10:53:02.0000] <nickshanks>
most hits i get are Windows people looking for free fonts

[10:54:00.0000] <nickshanks>
all my free fonts are AAT-based .dfont files

[10:55:00.0000] <gsnedders>
most common search referrer to my site: sports day speech

[10:55:01.0000] <zcorpan>
ah, i still have a bug

[10:55:02.0000] <gsnedders>
second is gsnedders 

[10:55:03.0000] <gsnedders>
third is: causes of love

[10:55:04.0000] <gsnedders>
how lovely

[10:55:05.0000] <gsnedders>
:\

[10:55:06.0000] <nickshanks>
where is 'causes of divorce' ?

[10:56:00.0000] <gsnedders>
no, I only tag posts with lust or love, not divorce.

[10:56:01.0000] <gsnedders>
I haven't done the marrying part yet (and legally can't)

[10:56:02.0000] <nickshanks>
causes of lust?

[10:56:03.0000] <zcorpan>
there

[10:56:04.0000] <nickshanks>
how old are you?

[10:56:05.0000] <gsnedders>
nickshanks: yeah, I have that (causes of lust)

[10:56:06.0000] <gsnedders>
nickshanks: 15

[10:56:07.0000] <nickshanks>
you can get married

[10:56:08.0000] <gsnedders>
"causes of emo" too

[10:56:09.0000] <nickshanks>
france 15

[10:57:00.0000] <nickshanks>
scotland 14

[10:57:01.0000] <gsnedders>
nickshanks: Scotland is 16

[10:57:02.0000] <nickshanks>
japan: any age

[10:57:03.0000] <nickshanks>
14 with consent

[10:57:04.0000] <nickshanks>
of parents

[10:57:05.0000] <gsnedders>
nickshanks: no, there is no difference between consent of parents or not

[10:57:06.0000] <gsnedders>
nickshanks: such a law only exists in England and Wales

zcorpan: You probably want to check .attributes[name].defined or what it is 

[11:01:01.0000] <nickshanks>
if you look at index-full.html that goes back to may 2005

aha, this is why i'm getting flaky mail service right now http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2007/11/17/gmail-forwarding-slowness

[11:02:01.0000] <zcorpan>
Dashiva: oh yep. though getAttribute worked as well

[11:02:02.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen: it doesn't work in ie6 because it doesn't support attribute selectors

Apparently, I'm "not so democratic or balanced" http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2007Nov/0104.html

[11:35:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Lachy__: You aren't me, so you're obviously not balanced

[11:36:00.0000] <hsivonen>
Lachy__: you can become an unbalanced dictator

[11:37:00.0000] <Lachy__>
I don't mind being called unbalanced, but I fail to see how any of my responses in regards to the web dev guide have been undemocratice

[11:38:01.0000] <Dashiva>
"The HTMLWG is becoming less and less democratic everyday. It has become a dictatorship driven by three companies: Google, Apple and Opera."

[11:38:02.0000] <Dashiva>
If that was true, we'd be publishing HTML 5 drafts by now >:O

[11:39:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand what Roy and Julian want

[11:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
what would it mean to describe the language without UA requirements?

[11:40:01.0000] <hsivonen>
Hixie: see the ODF spec :-)

[11:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
but that's a _bad_ thing

[11:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
is it just the scripting parts he wants taken out?

[11:42:01.0000] <Lachy>
I don't see how it is possible to address Roy's concern, since the group already resolved to call the spec HTML5 and the group knew exactly what the proposal contained when the decision was made

[11:42:02.0000] <Lachy>
he wan't anything that isn't related to the markup taken out, despite the fact that it's not actually possible to do with some things

[11:43:00.0000] <Hixie>
what isn't related to the markup?

[11:43:01.0000] <Hixie>
as far as i can see, everything in the spec is related to the markup

[11:44:00.0000] <Lachy>
no, I mean, just the syntax and element semantics

[11:44:01.0000] <tndH>
i read it as "pretend script doesn't exist and all documents are valid"

[11:45:00.0000] <Hixie>
"just the syntax and element semantics" would be mostly everything but scripting parts, no?

[11:45:01.0000] <Hixie>
does he want the parser out too?

[11:45:02.0000] <Lachy>
I presume he would be aware that we can't define how to parse HTML without at least considering document.write and innerHTML

[11:45:03.0000] <Hixie>
i can't tell

[11:45:04.0000] <Hixie>
i guess i'll wait for my mail to catch up and then ask him

[11:45:05.0000] <Lachy>
There are certainly some people who don't think the parser should be in there

[11:46:00.0000] <Hixie>
it's going to be hard to address everyone's desires in that case

[11:46:01.0000] <Hixie>
/me wonders how to address DanC's latest claim that we don't have critical mass

[11:50:00.0000] <Dashiva>
It didn't take long before the talk about "w3c members" as opposed to "html wg members" came up...

[11:51:00.0000] <Hixie>
8 months, that's not that short

[11:52:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Well, I was counting since the vote :)

[11:52:01.0000] <Hixie>
i'm amused because the companies he mentioned haven't, by and large, voted on any of the votes

[11:52:02.0000] <Hixie>
it's not clear how to address his concern

[11:55:00.0000] <hsivonen>
"W3C Reopens Emotion Incubator Group"

[12:25:00.0000] <othermaciej>
our charter specifically requires us to specify the DOM

[12:25:01.0000] <othermaciej>
Roy's request that we violate the charter is not really in order

[12:25:02.0000] <Hixie>
hah

[12:25:03.0000] <Hixie>
feel free to call him on it

[12:26:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I think you addressed his comments sufficiently

[12:26:01.0000] <Hixie>
well i still haven't received that e-mail

[12:26:02.0000] <Philip`>
The charter says it's "in scope" - does that actually mean it's required?

[12:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, it's hard to argue that we "shouldn't" do a category of things that the charter explicitly declares in scope

[13:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
hey, the forms tf missed their deadline

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, what insanity

[15:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
search for inurl:"nodetag.js" on Yahoo! and follow the trail

[15:38:00.0000] <Hixie>
i honestly thought it was some sort of botnet artefact for a while

turns out to be what appears to be part of a legitimate survey network (questionmarket.com)

[15:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
their scripts have such wacky things as:

function DL_rw_0_8721_0()

[15:40:02.0000] <Hixie>
{

[15:40:03.0000] <Hixie>
 if (0 != 4 && !0) {

[15:40:04.0000] <Hixie>
  setTimeout("DL_jsc_0_8721_0()" , Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) * 200 + 500);

[15:40:05.0000] <Hixie>
 } else {

[15:41:00.0000] <gavin>
o_O

[15:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
wow, a whole bunch of sites have identical stat.js files

[16:40:00.0000] <Hixie>
do Athenia Associates have anything to do with Movable Type?

[16:41:00.0000] <Hixie>
i don't understand why their copyright is in almost every mt-site.js file:

[16:41:01.0000] <Hixie>
http://www.solareditores.com/digital/blog/mt-site.js

[16:41:02.0000] <Hixie>
wait, that one doesn't mention movable type

[16:41:03.0000] <Hixie>
some of them do

[16:42:00.0000] <Hixie>
and they all look basically the same near the top

[16:44:00.0000] <Hixie>
many do seem to mention typekey

[16:44:01.0000] <Hixie>
which is a six apart thing, as is movable type, for which it was made, or something

[16:44:02.0000] <Hixie>
gah

[16:44:03.0000] <Hixie>
con-foosed

[17:02:00.0000] <kingryan>
Hixie: it looks like six apart just used some free code copyrighted by athenia

[17:14:00.0000] <Hixie>
maybe, yeah

[17:58:00.0000] <Hixie>
why are people still complaining about the spec having too much targetted at (whatever isn't their conformance class), when I've already said multiple times that we will in due course annotate the spec to provide different views to address this?

[17:58:01.0000] <Hixie>
do they just not believe me? or what?

[18:02:00.0000] <othermaciej>
well, T.V. Raman just favorably quoted a claim (effectively) that document conformance is not defined at all

[18:02:01.0000] <othermaciej>
which just seems wrong to me

[18:11:00.0000] <Dashiva>
Hixie: You're still *gasp* spending time editing those parts of the spec

[18:16:00.0000] <karlUshi>
Hixie?

[18:16:01.0000] <karlUshi>
would it be possible to change karl⊙wo by mike⊙wo in http://blog.whatwg.org/w3c-restarts-html-effort

[18:16:02.0000] <karlUshi>
I keep receiving requests :) 

[18:16:03.0000] <karlUshi>
that I would prefer to have to redirect to mike

[18:17:00.0000] <karlUshi>
Thanks.

[19:38:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
regarding request from karl, it might be better to just point that blog entry to here:

[19:38:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
http://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/40318/instructions

[20:05:00.0000] <Hixie>
karl: done

[20:05:01.0000] <Hixie>
MikeSmith: the reason for that blog post was that the instructions on w3.org weren't simple enough

[20:06:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie - OK, I see

[22:07:00.0000] <othermaciej>
http://www.justsayhi.com/bb/html_quiz

[22:10:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think i got about 70 odd when i tried

[22:10:01.0000] <Hixie>
i pasted the ones i missed in the channel

[22:12:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I got 65

[22:13:00.0000] <othermaciej>
any that both of us missed should probably be dropped :-)

[22:21:00.0000] <Hixie>
i missed some pretty important ones :-)

[22:22:00.0000] <mpt>
64

[22:24:00.0000] <mpt>
I forgot all the monospace ones

[22:28:00.0000] <othermaciej>
I missed <html>

[05:06:00.0000] <Philip`>
Is http://xml.resource.org/ the sensible thing for writing RFC-like documents?

[05:47:00.0000] <julianreschke>
Philip: yes, xml.resource.org is a good starting point. You may also want to try the XSLT version when generating HTML output.

[05:47:01.0000] <zcorpan>
hsivonen_: made http://simon.html5.org/temp/validator-nu-collapse.html work in ie6

[05:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
julianreschke: Okay, thanks

[05:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me tries the XSLT version, and sees that it seems to work nicely

[06:00:00.0000] <julianreschke>
Philip: if it doesn't, or if you have questions, please feel free to complain :-)

[07:02:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Hixie - awake?

[07:06:00.0000] <Lachy>
hey MikeSmith, that was an awesome response you sent about canvas today. Best explanation I've seen for why canvas is needed :-)

[07:10:00.0000] <MikeSmith>
Lachy - thanks

[07:10:01.0000] <MikeSmith>
took me a few minutes to write that one

[07:10:02.0000] <MikeSmith>
plus a few minutes prior to that to think about it a little

[07:18:00.0000] <hendry>
Lachy: URL? :)

[07:18:01.0000] <Lachy>
hendry, see public-html

[07:18:02.0000] <hendry>
ok

[07:20:00.0000] <zcorpan>
was it the very long email? :)

[07:20:01.0000] <Lachy>
yes

[07:21:00.0000] <zcorpan>
/me didn't read that one completely

[08:38:00.0000] <hendry>
can anyone recommend some good canvas demos that will work in Firefox 2.0.0.10?

[08:39:00.0000] <zcorpan>
define "good"

[08:39:01.0000] <hendry>
not tests

[08:40:00.0000] <hendry>
something that will impress your friends

[08:40:01.0000] <zcorpan>
http://simon.html5.org/presentations/html5-geekmeet.en points to 3 demos

[08:42:00.0000] <Philip`>
hendry: You really don't want 2.0.0.10

[08:43:00.0000] <Philip`>
because drawImage doesn't work in it

[08:43:01.0000] <hendry>
umm, http://tapper-ware.net/canvas3d/ doesn't work because of that

[08:44:00.0000] <Philip`>
Use http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2.0.0.11-candidates/rc1/ if you want anything non-trivial to work

[08:44:01.0000] <Philip`>
or use Opera :-)

[08:45:00.0000] <hendry>
are the any dev tools like PHP or something that make it easy for devs to generate canvas code? GWT?

[08:45:01.0000] <Philip`>
http://canvex.lazyilluminati.com/ is still my favourite canvas demo but I'm totally biased

[08:45:02.0000] <Philip`>
hendry: Why would you want to generate code, rather than just writing it?

[08:46:00.0000] <hendry>
ok, my use case wouldn't be games (like several of the demos I've seen)

[08:47:00.0000] <hendry>
i want to perhaps visualize data with canvas. so i'm left wondering perhaps howto get access.log and <canvas> to talk

[08:47:01.0000] <Philip`>
Like http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/ ?

[08:48:00.0000] <hendry>
Philip`: ah, that's more like it

[08:49:00.0000] <zcorpan>
or you could use svg :)

[08:52:00.0000] <hendry>
SVG almost detracts from canvas. Because you can use SVG for example instead of <canvas> in plotkit can't you? And probably in a lot of other use cases too

[08:53:00.0000] <zcorpan>
likely

[08:53:01.0000] <Philip`>
There are lots of cases where they can overlap

[08:53:02.0000] <Philip`>
and some of those are nicer in canvas, and some are nicer in SVG

[08:54:00.0000] <Philip`>
and other cases can only realistically be done in one or the other

[08:55:00.0000] <hendry>
ok an example for specific case

[08:56:00.0000] <hendry>
can SVG do animation? canvas can defn. do animation

[08:56:01.0000] <hendry>
canvas is somewhat supported in IE6 right? that SVG isn't?

[08:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
SVG can do declarative animation, and you can do scripted animation too

[08:58:00.0000] <hendry>
hmm, so there is no distinction between the two with animation

[08:58:01.0000] <Philip`>
There's a nasty hack to get some support for some parts of <canvas> in IE, which it seems people are using successfully in practice

[08:59:00.0000] <Philip`>
I don't think anyone does the same to make SVG work in IE

[08:59:01.0000] <hendry>
so +1 for canvas. kinda.d

[09:00:00.0000] <hendry>
i need IE6 on this macosx machine i have for testing

[09:00:01.0000] <Philip`>
hendry: There is a distinction - e.g. SVG lets you animate a single object moving, whereas canvas requires you to repaint the entire screen whenever you change something

[09:01:00.0000] <Philip`>
and SVG has annoying bugs in most implementations when you try doing something fancy, whereas canvas is more predictable since it has simple bugs instead of fancy bugs

[09:02:00.0000] <hendry>
so there is some talk about canvas3D

[09:02:01.0000] <hendry>
silly question: can SVG do 3D? :)

[09:03:00.0000] <Philip`>
Canvas-3d is pretty much totally different to canvas-2d

[09:03:01.0000] <Philip`>
(http://blog.vlad1.com/2007/11/26/canvas-3d-gl-power-web-style/ etc)

[09:03:02.0000] <hendry>
and so would SVG-3D I guess (if it exists?)

[09:04:00.0000] <Philip`>
SVG is just focussed on 2D, and doesn't make it easy to emulate 3D

[09:04:01.0000] <Philip`>
There's stuff like X3D which is kind of analogous to SVG except 3D

[09:04:02.0000] <hendry>
http://apike.ca/prog_svg_threed.html

[09:07:00.0000] <hendry>
/me thinks if i could do a couple of ven diagrams showing 1) support in browsers 2) use cases it could accomplish

[09:07:01.0000] <hendry>
perhaps a little pointless as the future (support + features) is probably the most important elements in my mind.

[09:07:02.0000] <Philip`>
That cube appears to not work in either Opera or Firefox 2 :-(

[09:09:00.0000] <Philip`>
From what I've seen, canvas-2d allows slightly more impressive 3D emulation, though obviously it's all useless compared to canvas-3d

[12:57:00.0000] <Philip`>
/me wonders why "[whatwg] "All" checkbox possible?" got marked as spam

[12:58:00.0000] <Philip`>
False positives are kind of annoying :-(

[14:17:00.0000] <Hixie>
someone with an account on this forum -- http://www.memestreams.net/thread/bid34588/ -- should post a reply pointing them to the updated faq answer

[14:20:00.0000] <G0k>
hey has anyone read about the w3c REX thing?

[14:21:00.0000] <G0k>
http://www.w3.org/TR/rex/

[14:22:00.0000] <Hixie>
my understanding is that patent issues killed that spec

[14:22:01.0000] <Hixie>
but i could be wrong

[14:22:02.0000] <Hixie>
it was basically a dom patching format

[14:23:00.0000] <G0k>
patents on...dom patching?

[14:23:01.0000] <G0k>
(only curious because html5's dom events thing has some major cross over there)

[14:23:02.0000] <Hixie>
i don't know what the patents were on, i specifically try to avoid learning about patents so as to avoid patent knowledge liability

[14:23:03.0000] <Hixie>
the dom events stuff is actually very different

[14:23:04.0000] <Hixie>
it doesn't do dom patching, it just spawns events

[14:24:00.0000] <Hixie>
rex sounds like the same thing but is actually very different when you look at actually what it does

[14:24:01.0000] <Hixie>
iirc

[14:24:02.0000] <G0k>
the events could be dom manipulation events though right?

[14:24:03.0000] <Hixie>
sure but they don't cause anything to happen

[14:24:04.0000] <G0k>
although...it doesn't specify how you handle them

[14:24:05.0000] <G0k>
ah

[14:24:06.0000] <G0k>
yeah

[14:24:07.0000] <Hixie>
dom manipulation events everywhere except in the rex spec are triggered _by_ mutations, not the other way aronud (which is unique to rex)

[14:28:00.0000] <G0k>
interesting

[15:29:00.0000] <Hixie>
i think i can safely announce that /js/ is the winner of most popular directory to put your site-specific scripts in

[15:29:01.0000] <Hixie>
outbeating /scripts/ and /jscripts/ and /javascript/ by a lot

[15:32:00.0000] <othermaciej>
how popular is "ecmascript"?

[15:33:00.0000] <Hixie>
i didn't see it

[15:34:00.0000] <Dashiva>
What about for style?

[15:34:01.0000] <Hixie>
don't know, just doing scripts here

[15:35:00.0000] <jwalden>
/me snickers at "ecmascript"

[15:36:00.0000] <othermaciej>
that's about the level I was expecting

[15:36:01.0000] <othermaciej>
/me was thinking of proposing that ECMAScript 4 be renamed to JavaScript 4

[15:36:02.0000] <othermaciej>
because most web developers haven't a fucking clue what ECMAScript is

[15:37:00.0000] <Hixie>
ECMAScript was used to avoid trademark issues with Sun and Java

[15:37:01.0000] <Hixie>
it was intentionally a stupid name so nobody would use it

[15:39:00.0000] <othermaciej>
yeah, I don't think the trademark issue is real

[15:39:01.0000] <othermaciej>
certainly not any more
