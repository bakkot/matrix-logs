feedback: the "notifications" dropdown is backwards. it puts the newest stuff at the bottom

I logged in on another browser and now some of my DMs are “encrypted” and i can’t see any of the messages. How can i turn that off? I want nothing encrypted; my login should be sufficient.

requiring encryption knowledge to have a multi-device web session seems exceedingly hostile to all the groups matrix was supposed to help :-/

ljharb: in the "security and privacy" section in the settings, you can click a single button to fetch the keys from all other devices/sessions. That should fix it.

It doesn’t, probably because the other session is active on my powered-down in-the-shop laptop.

iow, it seems like I’ll never get those keys back and never be able to unencrypted those DMs unless i can get my laptop back and working again (which isn’t a guarantee)

Any easy way to reset end-to-end encryption keys? Nothing evident in the settings page.

or to just disable them entirely, i don’t care about encrypting my tc39 conversations

Me too, but I had couple of conversations on desktop, it is not syncing on mobile until I enable E2E encryption
