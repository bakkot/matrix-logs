sooo the default view is way too whitespacey, and the compact view is much better but still a bit too compact. more customization would be ideal

[10:51:28.0171] <ljharb>
also matrix hijacks native Mac OS key combos, so it'd be really nice to be able to customize those

hmm, interestingly i now have two matrix accounts: one from `matrix.org` and another from `mozilla.org`.. so i am now logged into two separate instances from two separate accounts :s

[22:09:38.0447] <DerekNonGeneric>
/me wonders what the preferable account to connect from would be

[22:11:23.0620] <DerekNonGeneric>
ryzokuken: i see you are connected from `igalia.com`, is it best to use your employer's instance or ..?

[22:36:28.0120] <ryzokuken>
DerekNonGeneric: yeah, I'd recommend you use the mozilla.org account, the best part of a federated chat is that you don't need multiple accounts

[23:06:07.0809] <DerekNonGeneric>
ryzokuken: thanks for the recommendation; it might be a good idea to add something about this in the guide if it is silent on the topic at the moment

[23:14:51.0508] <ryzokuken>
I tried to achieve this by the "skip this section if you already have an account" message, but maybe something more explicit would be better

[23:21:58.0499] <DerekNonGeneric>
agreed!

[23:28:40.0334] <DerekNonGeneric>
ryzokuken: if you do plan on expanding this section of the guide: maybe something worth exploring is that it seems like the `mozilla.org` accounts require additional verification to acquire (2FA+)

pfff, the Element desktop client on Windows is ðŸš®

[13:03:14.0785] <DerekNonGeneric>
pilot testing this has been a net negative experience for me so far, but appreciate the effort that was put into it

The electron app? What's particularly bad?

[12:44:59.0093] <DerekNonGeneric>
a lot of things, need to make a list

- reactions to comments that were made using the web app are not visible on the android or windows native apps

[17:01:52.0631] <DerekNonGeneric>
- pinging people using the windows app do not show up as having pinged that person in the logs

[17:03:37.0109] <DerekNonGeneric>
- neither the windows app nor the web app allow me to join the TC39 space (this could be because i am using the mozilla count, which perhaps does not have this beta feature enabled yet)

[17:03:56.0722] <DerekNonGeneric>
ryzokuken: some notes above, sorry for the delay

[19:53:52.0464] <DerekNonGeneric>
going to switch back to the matrix account

[19:58:36.0083] <ryzokuken>
If you're using the desktop app, there's a way to run multiple profiles

[20:01:20.0015] <DerekNonGeneric>
i can't figure out a bunch of stuff w/ the mozilla account either

[20:05:11.0654] <ryzokuken>
The Mozilla synapse version might be a bit old? 

[20:11:56.0905] <DerekNonGeneric>
probably

[20:13:17.0584] <DerekNonGeneric>
that is probably the reason why other mozilla peeps are not in the other rooms in this space (they cannot see the space at all)

[20:16:52.0114] <DerekNonGeneric>
just want to go back to IRC now

[20:22:47.0646] <DerekNonGeneric>
 * ~~whoever is curating the rooms of this space seems to have removed a bunch too~~

[20:27:57.0796] <DerekNonGeneric>
lol hopefully everyone else has a better experience

[20:31:56.0518] <ryzokuken>
> <@dereknongeneric:matrix.org> just want to go back to IRC now

I feel that even despite these issues, matrix is an improvement... 

[20:32:49.0522] <ryzokuken>
The first two points you made, I've never noticed. It might be something specific to the windows client, I'll try installing it on my windows machine later today
