As a reminder, today's meeting is using 8x8

i cannot make this meeting, i have a conflict at 4pm PT

[10:34:36.0136] <shu>
was a more detailed agenda posted? i didn't see what was scheduled to be talked about last time i checked

[12:43:47.0321] <Granville Schmidt>
No worries at all, shu!

Michael Ficarra added "Strategies used and features/invariants relied upon to write secure programs today" to the agenda ( https://github.com/tc39/tg3/blob/main/meetings/agendas/2021/12-01.md ); however, he will be unable to join today, so this item will be moved to the January meeting.

Does anyone else have something they would like to discuss today? If not, it may make sense to cancel this meeting and start planning out the January meeting: https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/413

FWIW, W3C has this self-assessment security&privacy questionnaire that is super useful to get an understanding of new specifications. https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/

and here's an example to see how I filled it out for the Sanitizer API https://github.com/WICG/sanitizer-api/blob/main/security-questionnaire.md
