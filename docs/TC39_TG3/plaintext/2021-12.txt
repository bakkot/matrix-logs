No worries at all, shu!

Michael Ficarra added "Strategies used and features/invariants relied upon to write secure programs today" to the agenda ( https://github.com/tc39/tg3/blob/main/meetings/agendas/2021/12-01.md ); however, he will be unable to join today, so this item will be moved to the January meeting.

Does anyone else have something they would like to discuss today? If not, it may make sense to cancel this meeting and start planning out the January meeting: https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/413
