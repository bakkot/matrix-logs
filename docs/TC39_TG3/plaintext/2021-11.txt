About document.all.

Is it possible to remove that special behavior?
I know it has a high usage rate but high usage rate doesn't mean the website is likely to be broken if we correct it's behavior.

It have benefits to remove them for both implementation and the spec editor.

Another question, Promise has a similar "species" behavior. Does that creates implementation bugs too?

Ah and also. Since Array species creates bugs, is it possible to fully throw code using this feature to the slow path with no optimization? I think it's ok because the usage of species is low
