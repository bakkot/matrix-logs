About document.all.

Is it possible to remove that special behavior?
I know it has a high usage rate but high usage rate doesn't mean the website is likely to be broken if we correct it's behavior.

It have benefits to remove them for both implementation and the spec editor.

Another question, Promise has a similar "species" behavior. Does that creates implementation bugs too?

could someone link me the notes doc

in a PM

Ah and also. Since Array species creates bugs, is it possible to fully throw code using this feature to the slow path with no optimization? I think it's ok because the usage of species is low

no, as i recall it was explicitly added to the JS spec _because_ it was impossible to remove and HTML didn't want to continue the willful violation forever

I'm wondering how many websites will be broken exactly if we remove that special behavior

[19:45:36.0012] <ljharb>
Good question, but itâ€™s moot if browsers are unwilling to either measure or take the risk - and itâ€™s not within tc39â€™s power to mandate either.

I removed it until the notes are updated based on the transcript and they have been reviewed.

Team - I have verified that the 8x8 supports transcription and seems to work well from my limited test. I'm able to create my own meeting under /tc39/g.schmidt, but I'm researching to see if it's possible to have /tc39/tg3 as a permanent meeting space.

Hi please review this please thanks! This new design has been simplified to reduce the branch diverging on hot path

[09:34:13.0745] <Jack Works>
And I think it's worth to add, but I need some feedback so I can iterate on the design. Thanks!
