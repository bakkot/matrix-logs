About document.all.

Is it possible to remove that special behavior?
I know it has a high usage rate but high usage rate doesn't mean the website is likely to be broken if we correct it's behavior.

It have benefits to remove them for both implementation and the spec editor.

Another question, Promise has a similar "species" behavior. Does that creates implementation bugs too?

could someone link me the notes doc

in a PM

Ah and also. Since Array species creates bugs, is it possible to fully throw code using this feature to the slow path with no optimization? I think it's ok because the usage of species is low

no, as i recall it was explicitly added to the JS spec _because_ it was impossible to remove and HTML didn't want to continue the willful violation forever

FYI, the notes haven't be reviewed yet, and link to the full transcript, and this channel is public

I'm wondering how many websites will be broken exactly if we remove that special behavior

[19:45:36.0012] <ljharb>
Good question, but itâ€™s moot if browsers are unwilling to either measure or take the risk - and itâ€™s not within tc39â€™s power to mandate either.
