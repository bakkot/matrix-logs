I don't think Mozilla will be able to find someone on such short notice - from Saturday to Monday/Tuesday. The proposed times are quite late for me in Europe and I'll see if our delegate in US Pacific will be able to make it, but it's a bit short notice...

also too late for me, only 1 slot is ok to me, other slots are midnight 3~5 am

Chris de Almeida: I don't see anything added to the calendar, and some of the proposed times are already starting to pass. Why the rush to get this meeting planned? We've already had a long wait since the last meeting, I'd rather give plenty of notice so we can get more attendance.

I was going to create the calendar item today.  Doing it this week was the only realistic option to get folks together prior to plenary -- which is important if we want to confirm chair(s) appointment at plenary, which is a goal I was hoping we could achieve, as that was the blocker discussed from last plenary.

[10:34:46.0984] <Chris de Almeida>
I apologize for the short notice (and the lack of APAC-friendly times -- which is also something I wanted to discuss for future meetings).  I am hoping folks are still willing to meet and discuss, even if that includes punting some things to after plenary.
