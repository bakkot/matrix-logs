(again, conflicts this afternoon...)

Hello Shu. I'm really sorry to hear that it just showed up on your calendar. It has been scheduled and on the TC39 calendar for some time now. Was there anything that you would like us to bring to the meeting in your absence?

[14:15:07.0915] <shu>
no problem, sounds like my fault

[14:15:53.0614] <shu>
Granville Schmidt: nothing beyond my comments in https://github.com/tc39/security/issues/7#issuecomment-1034369047 if that topic is discussed

[14:47:57.0620] <Granville Schmidt>
Sounds good, shu! I'll be sure to bring this to the groups attention. Also, if there's any better way that you would like to be notified about upcoming meeting times, please let me know. I want to ensure that everyone is notified.

[19:21:49.0895] <Jack Works>
hmm looks like I've missed the meeting 4 hrs ago

[10:20:28.0252] <Mathieu Hofman>
Jack Works: we didn't discuss that topic at TG3, but we did discuss it some in the second half of the SES meeting

[10:21:36.0238] <Mathieu Hofman>
Looks like we haven't uploaded the recording yet

Is there a tg3 meeting 1hr later? 

[09:27:33.0016] <Jack Works>
I see it on the tc39 calendar

[11:15:16.0574] <ljharb>
there is not one on the tc39 calendar

[11:15:31.0251] <ljharb>
ohhh you mean the "Security Strategy Meeting"

[11:15:53.0221] <ljharb>
the agenda doc says it's cancelled (and it's not TG3, it's more like SES i think)
