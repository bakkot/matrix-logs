Hello Shu. I'm really sorry to hear that it just showed up on your calendar. It has been scheduled and on the TC39 calendar for some time now. Was there anything that you would like us to bring to the meeting in your absence?

no problem, sounds like my fault

Granville Schmidt: nothing beyond my comments in https://github.com/tc39/security/issues/7#issuecomment-1034369047 if that topic is discussed
