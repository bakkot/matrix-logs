ljharb I pushed a few new commits after your rebase, sorry

no worries, no conflicts; updated again

[21:48:32.0000] <ljharb>
Bakkot: looks like ecmarkup has a runtime dep on eslint 6, which depends on a vulnerable version of lodash. not sure if updating it will avoid the CVE, but either way, can ecmarkup be updated to use eslint 7?

[22:09:41.0000] <Bakkot>
it should not be a runtime dependency, I'll fix that

[22:09:46.0000] <Bakkot>
will see about updating

[23:05:58.0000] <Bakkot>
oh, it is a runtime dependency, I forgot

[23:06:05.0000] <Bakkot>
anyway works fine with 7, afaict

shu: jmdyck pointed out that we are inconsistent about saying "PrivateElement" vs "PrivateElement Record"; do you have a preference?

[18:28:40.0000] <shu>
Bakkot: i have a preference in general for dropping "Record" if there's a well named thing

[19:40:32.0000] <ljharb>
as long as it's right before the `{ }` syntax, and auto-links, i'm not sure what "Record" adds

Bakkot: btw there's no tags pushed up to ecmarkup for v5, or anything beyhond v6

[22:01:38.0000] <Bakkot>
yeah I do not have a policy of maintaining tags

[22:01:43.0000] <ljharb>
? a policy?

[22:02:02.0000] <ljharb>
it's how specific versions are easily identified

[22:02:04.0000] <Bakkot>
I'm not opposed to them, necessarily, I just don't make a habit of keeping them up to date

[22:02:20.0000] <ljharb>
so you don't have them locally, you're saying

[22:02:43.0000] <Bakkot>
correct

[22:02:54.0000] <ljharb>
i can fill them in then, i guess

[22:03:13.0000] <Bakkot>
if you are inclined to, go for it

[22:03:34.0000] <Bakkot>
should be a one-liner assuming I didn't mess up the commit messages

[22:03:44.0000] <ljharb>
how do you do version bumps? the commit messages look like they're from `npm version` but that tags automatically

[22:04:43.0000] <Bakkot>
"git commit -am 'Version X.X.X'"

[22:05:30.0000] <ljharb>
lol ok, seems like more typing than `npm version x.x.x` to me

[22:06:16.0000] <Bakkot>
never got that particular habit

[22:06:25.0000] <Bakkot>
"git commit -am 'Version X.X.X'" works across all languages

[22:06:41.0000] <Bakkot>
`npm version` is an idiom you have to learn specifically for javascript projects, and it breaks when you're working in repos for other languages

[22:07:17.0000] <ljharb>
sure, fair enough. i'd be surprised if tagging versions wasn't a pretty universal idiom thjo

[22:07:36.0000] <Bakkot>
yeah I have an alias I use at work which does the tagging too

[22:07:44.0000] <ljharb>
ah

[22:07:54.0000] <Bakkot>
I just don't ever remember to use it on my personal computer, which is the one where I'm logged in to npm
