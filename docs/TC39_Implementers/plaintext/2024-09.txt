what's the perf of Object.hasOwn vs Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call? (re https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/54710#issuecomment-2325374488 )

i agree with joyee's comment

[13:05:42.0201] <snek>
it could be improved though

[13:14:15.0730] <ljharb>
i'm sure it's accurate. but it doesn't make any sense to me why it'd be implemented in that way

[13:14:26.0528] <shu>
how would you implement it?

[13:14:58.0590] <snek>
i would imagine it was convenient at the time. generally v8 development goes like 1) implement thing correctly and then 2) optimize given the known working impl

[14:42:43.0049] <canadahonk>
fwiw I implemented it basically the same in my engine

[16:04:51.0387] <ljharb>
i would assume that whatever hasOwnProperty does to check that the object has the property is the same thing hasOwn would do

[16:04:59.0000] <ljharb>
as opposed to just wrapping hasOwnProperty

[16:27:43.0095] <bakkot>
then all of the various optimizations which look for hasOwnProperty would have to be updated to look for both hasOwn and hasOwnProperty

[16:33:32.0653] <shu>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> i would assume that whatever hasOwnProperty does to check that the object has the property is the same thing hasOwn would do

but why would this make hasOwn faster than hasOwnProperty?

[16:42:24.0266] <ljharb>
it wouldn't, it'd make it no slower

[16:42:30.0569] <ljharb>
 * it wouldn't, it'd make it "no slower"

[16:43:37.0920] <shu>
best to benchmark the current difference, i expect a few branches won't matter too much in practice if you think hasOwn is better stylistically

[16:44:02.0592] <Justin Ridgewell>
I don’t think the call is the slow part of the implementation?

[16:44:16.0368] <Justin Ridgewell>
It’s the extra checks done before the call

[16:46:01.0206] <ljharb>
node folks get very perf-sensitive

[16:46:55.0752] <ljharb>
so even the mere suggestion that hasOwn is slower caused the entire PR i linked to be abandoned.

[16:47:17.0728] <shu>
> <@jridgewell:matrix.org> It’s the extra checks done before the call

i don't think those are expensive checks?

[16:48:00.0657] <Justin Ridgewell>
Definitely not expensive, but they’re extra work vs not doing the checks.

[16:48:10.0870] <shu>
well of course, the question is does it matter

[16:48:27.0014] <Meghan Denny>
fwiw mdn is recommending hasOwn over hasOwnProperty

[16:49:05.0777] <bakkot>
 * https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/builtins/builtins-object-gen.cc;l=690-717 (oh I see it was already linked in the node thread, oops)

[16:49:15.0665] <shu>
if the goal is to use 'hasOwn' for whatever reason, and that reason needs to be traded off against possible performance regressions, either you are willing to quantify the regression or not

[16:49:37.0407] <shu>
if you are not willing to quantify the regression (and find out if it matters), that says to me the "whatever reason" for wanting to use `hasOwn` is already pretty weak
