what's the perf of Object.hasOwn vs Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call? (re https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/54710#issuecomment-2325374488 )

i agree with joyee's comment

[13:05:42.0201] <snek>
it could be improved though

[13:14:15.0730] <ljharb>
i'm sure it's accurate. but it doesn't make any sense to me why it'd be implemented in that way

[13:14:26.0528] <shu>
how would you implement it?

[13:14:58.0590] <snek>
i would imagine it was convenient at the time. generally v8 development goes like 1) implement thing correctly and then 2) optimize given the known working impl

[14:42:43.0049] <canadahonk>
fwiw I implemented it basically the same in my engine

[16:04:51.0387] <ljharb>
i would assume that whatever hasOwnProperty does to check that the object has the property is the same thing hasOwn would do

[16:04:59.0000] <ljharb>
as opposed to just wrapping hasOwnProperty

[16:27:43.0095] <bakkot>
then all of the various optimizations which look for hasOwnProperty would have to be updated to look for both hasOwn and hasOwnProperty
