what's the perf of Object.hasOwn vs Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call? (re https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/54710#issuecomment-2325374488 )

i agree with joyee's comment

[13:05:42.0201] <snek>
it could be improved though

[13:14:15.0730] <ljharb>
i'm sure it's accurate. but it doesn't make any sense to me why it'd be implemented in that way

[13:14:26.0528] <shu>
how would you implement it?

[13:14:58.0590] <snek>
i would imagine it was convenient at the time. generally v8 development goes like 1) implement thing correctly and then 2) optimize given the known working impl
