> <@pchimento:igalia.com> hi! in test262 we have an [RFC](https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3724) open (our first, as a trial of a new RFC process) about adding some facilities to test262 for improving the experience of writing asynchronous tests. we'd love to have some feedback from the perspective of implementers maintaining a test262 runner, and from (potential) test writers.

hi again! heads up that this RFC has entered final comment period until 2023-01-19.
