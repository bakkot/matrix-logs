shu: is it normal that v8 hasn't had a stable release since 9.9 in january? node is using v10.2

[15:25:30.0961] <shu>
we have had them, not sure what you mean

[15:25:54.0073] <shu>
we haven't published blog posts for them, however

[15:26:29.0066] <shu>
moving to a model where we'll publish blog posts when there is something worth calling out, like a major performance improvement or anew on-by-default flagged feature

[15:28:34.0765] <shu>
in any case the stable releases coincide with the chrome branch cuts, so they happen as a part of a regular schedule and will continue to happen as part of that schedule

[15:28:40.0793] <shu>
which is... at a 4 week cadence now, i think? let me check

[15:29:00.0869] <shu>
looks like 4 weeks, yes

[15:31:06.0748] <ljharb>
ah ok

[15:31:15.0489] <ljharb>
wikipedia also says the latest stable release is 9.9

[15:31:34.0134] <ljharb>
and i asked because someone on irc asked. so i think the blog posts might be how a lot of people get notified when there's a release
