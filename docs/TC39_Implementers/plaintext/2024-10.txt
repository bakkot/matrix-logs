Hey, would it be possible for your test262 harnesses to support running tests that use top-level await without `flags: [async]` and `$DONE`? i.e. if `.Evaluate()` on the entrypoint returns a promise, you automatically wait for its result.

The reason I'm asking is that writing tests that use top-level await is incredibly annoying when it comes to dependencies, because you cannot try/catch around imports to then call `$DONE` with the error.
