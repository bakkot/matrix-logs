rkirsling: i'd like to know if JSC has a performance penalty related to TDZ checks, and if so, how much

[20:26:36.0480] <shu>
the best open source benchmark i know of is the TSC PR that switched to vars

[20:26:40.0788] <shu>
but i don't know how you'd run that under JSC

[20:28:03.0558] <rkirsling>
hm hm hm

[20:28:10.0934] <rkirsling>

[20:28:49.0320] <rkirsling>
I think the simple answer is "yes" but a figure would be useful
