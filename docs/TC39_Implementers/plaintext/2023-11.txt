say shu , is there anything specific that should be looked into following your TDZ talk last plenary?

[17:31:38.0955] <rkirsling>
down to help if there's something to be done

[20:26:16.0143] <shu>
rkirsling: i'd like to know if JSC has a performance penalty related to TDZ checks, and if so, how much

[20:26:36.0480] <shu>
the best open source benchmark i know of is the TSC PR that switched to vars

[20:26:40.0788] <shu>
but i don't know how you'd run that under JSC

[20:28:03.0558] <rkirsling>
hm hm hm

[20:28:10.0934] <rkirsling>
okay cool

[20:28:49.0320] <rkirsling>
I think the simple answer is "yes" but a figure would be useful

[21:01:45.0985] <rkirsling>

mgaudetany idea when ArrayBuffer transfer is going to be unflagged in FF? it's still flagged in v119 it seems

[07:35:32.0920] <mgaudet>
ljharb: I've opened https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1865103

[07:56:33.0076] <ljharb>
awesome thanks! i assume that means itâ€™ll be > 6 weeks til thatâ€™s released?

[08:08:34.0889] <mgaudet>
Yes. We'd almost certainly not uplift this without a strong need.
