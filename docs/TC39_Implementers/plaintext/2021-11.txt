oof, chrome's added a way for sites to block "view source"? https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3260807

[20:22:34.0445] <Jack Works>
The error message is net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ADMINISTRATOR

[20:23:16.0903] <Jack Works>
So I guess this feature is something like enterprise management

[20:41:14.0065] <jmdyck>
couldn't someone just use a different browser to view source?
