oof, chrome's added a way for sites to block "view source"? https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/3260807

[20:22:34.0445] <Jack Works>
The error message is net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ADMINISTRATOR

[20:23:16.0903] <Jack Works>
So I guess this feature is something like enterprise management

[20:41:14.0065] <jmdyck>
couldn't someone just use a different browser to view source?

[20:48:25.0410] <Jack Works>
Since it's in a enterprise environment, it's likely not be allowed to install other browsers

[21:22:26.0555] <bakkot>
from reading the bug, it's not for sites, it's for domain admins (i.e. the people running the browser)

[21:22:44.0074] <bakkot>
e.g. schools who want to block students from going to site X also want to stop them from viewing the source for site X

[21:23:41.0123] <bakkot>
apparently frequently the X in question is a Google Forms page which schools are using to administer tests? https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/attachment?aid=447164&signed_aid=iZPmi6KtTPPRkuOjVYccag==&inline=1

[21:23:59.0776] <bakkot>
which, uh, probably there are other bad things going on with that, but.

[21:26:02.0010] <bakkot>
 * which, uh, probably there are other problems with trying to use google forms for quizzes, but.

[21:48:36.0808] <ryzokuken>
why not... and hear me out here... score the test server side?

[22:03:02.0453] <bakkot>
sounds hard

[22:05:50.0717] <bakkot>
(I mean, legitimately, for nontechnical people with other stuff to do. Google Forms is a technology people already know how to use; procuring, understanding, and teaching a different one, just for giving simple quizzes, is a lot to ask of teachers)

[22:48:54.0255] <ryzokuken>
oh no, I meant for Google Forms! Like... why can't they avoid transmitting any of that info to the client?

[22:50:26.0109] <devsnek>
cuz they can add a view source blocker to the browser that all the schools use

[22:50:36.0114] <devsnek>
welcome to monopoly 

[09:23:17.0893] <ljharb>
thatâ€™s still super harmful; if an exam is coded so badly the answers are in the client, it deserves to be circumvented.

[09:27:31.0270] <shu>
back in my day i took exams on parchment and ink

[10:39:35.0098] <bakkot>
I do not really share the opinion that cheating is morally right just because it is technologically possible, myself

[10:39:58.0885] <bakkot>
and think that it is fine for people to try to find ways to make the cheating technologically harder even if it remains possible
