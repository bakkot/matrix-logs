hi, test262 would appreciate some feedback on whether this requirement would potentially be a problem for your test262 runners: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4398/commits/6ccad34e9b2e2119d39e889be48fd592ef07ef2e

evaluating the scripts in order of inclusion is actually required currently by the v8 runner

[10:54:05.0471] <shu>
since these helper scripts define globals, the two reasonable options i see are either requiring they be evaluated in order, or that no helper script can assume any other helper script has run (e.g. can't use assert functions or anything)

[11:23:26.0063] <ptomato>
the interpreting instructions already do specify that `assert.js` and `sta.js` must be run first regardless of other helper scripts, so there are a few things including asserts that can be assumed to be present in helper scripts

[11:27:38.0656] <ptomato>
another reasonable option would be to allow helper scripts to import other helper scripts. but I don't see a reason to do that right now

[11:36:02.0321] <bakkot>
my runner does not support esm so I would like to avoid having the helpers depend on imports/exports

[11:36:14.0466] <bakkot>
the evaluation order requirement is fine for me
