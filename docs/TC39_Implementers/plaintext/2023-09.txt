I have a performance question. if a and b are the same type (no type conversion will happen), then is a==b fast as a===b?

I'm also curious, from a specification point of view, the conversion of IsLooselyEqual to IsStrictlyEqual does require additional operations, but both abstract operations have their own type judgments for the operands. For the case where the two operands are of the same type, whether it can be optimized it
