Hello implementers! The questions of add implementation complexity has been brought up in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-symbols-as-weakmap-keys/issues/21
TDLR: In the world where symbols are allowed in `Weak{Map, Ref, Set}` and `FinalizationRegistry`.
Are there implementations concerns on also allowing `Symbol.for` symbols.
e.g. for engines (SM?) that GC registered symbols. It would need to branch and ensure these are actually held strongly by the WeakMap/Set/Ref

The thread also discusses the end-developer-expierence of either allowing or throwing for registered symbols.
