FYI: I’ve invited @tab to join us on Wednesday to promote, receive encouragement, and collect feedback for seeded random https://github.com/tc39/proposal-seeded-random

I don't think it's clear from the README, but is seeded random supposed to be usable as a CSPRNG?

Bring yo’ questions! That’s a good one.

In my opinion, it doesn’t have to be, but should say so in the name if it is. Maybe even say it isn’t if it’s not.

unfortunately I won't be able to make it

[17:28:02.0166] <kriskowal>
I can relay the question. Is there an answer you prefer?

My understanding is that this intentionally _not_ a CSPRNG but a deterministic PRNG such that keeping a consistent seed make testing "random" behavior observable and repeatable
