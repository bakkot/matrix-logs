Can I get access to the tc39 github? I got accepted as an invited expert and signed the additional contributor agreement

we have a normal process for that ( https://github.com/tc39/Admin-and-Business/issues/471 for those that can see it ) and it has to wait for the chairs to do the next step

Ah, ok. Thanks for the info. I don't have access to that page

you already have access to the TC39 GH ðŸ™‚  all the interesting bits anyway.  there is very little in the way of private repos.  pretty much just plenary meeting information and other assorted administrative stuff
