Can I get access to the tc39 github? I got accepted as an invited expert and signed the additional contributor agreement

[08:52:34.0923] <ljharb>
we have a normal process for that ( https://github.com/tc39/Admin-and-Business/issues/471 for those that can see it ) and it has to wait for the chairs to do the next step

[08:53:42.0274] <Eli Grey>
Ah, ok. Thanks for the info. I don't have access to that page

[09:24:40.0949] <Chris de Almeida>
you already have access to the TC39 GH ðŸ™‚  all the interesting bits anyway.  there is very little in the way of private repos.  pretty much just plenary meeting information and other assorted administrative stuff

does the meeting link changed?

[10:02:21.0361] <phoddie (Peter Hoddie)>
"You cannot join this meeting because the host's account is no longer active"?

Please look at the TC39 calendar for the new Zoom link.

IBMâ€™s hosting of WebEx is no more.

I wrote down some thoughts about a lightweight "number with precision" from yesterday's call: https://gist.github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/27c6156cefe27cf488f028e0236dc667

nicolo-ribaudo: What is the intended interpretation of `12341n.withPrecision(4).valueOf(); // 1234e1n`, given that `1234e1n` is not a valid BigInt literal? Does `valueOf()` return a string, or should that have been `12340n`, or are you proposing a syntax expansion?
