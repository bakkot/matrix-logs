Someone sent an AI assistant to transcribe today’s TG-3 meeting, which did not convene but we did discuss plans for next week and beyond for a while off the record. The bot sent Mark a transcript, which surprised and confused. Anyone know where this bot is coming from?

I think it would be consistent with our policy to just kick it out when it arrives, because we very clearly demarcate the portion of the meeting that is intended to be recorded.

And we post those recordings, so if there’s a need for a transcript, we can create one trivially after-the-fact.
