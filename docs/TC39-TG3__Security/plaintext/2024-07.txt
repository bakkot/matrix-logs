Hey I opened https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3374 to remove the dynamic scoping from indirect eval, reviews are appreciated

[02:38:38.0002] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'll try to prepare some slides for next plenary

@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org you should add it to the agenda now, you can always add slides later

sorry i'm late; what have i missed so far?

[10:26:25.0585] <Michael Ficarra>
the thing on screen, that's it

[10:27:47.0897] <ljharb>
lol ok

[10:33:13.0767] <Michael Ficarra>
whenever `eval` comes up, I just tune out because I couldn't give a single fuck about what happens once someone invokes `eval`

[10:33:17.0842] <Michael Ficarra>
it may as well be UB

[12:50:48.0203] <Mathieu Hofman>
eval doesn't have to be evil ;)
