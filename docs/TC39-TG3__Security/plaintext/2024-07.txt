Hey I opened https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3374 to remove the dynamic scoping from indirect eval, reviews are appreciated

[02:38:38.0002] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'll try to prepare some slides for next plenary

[09:09:24.0244] <Michael Ficarra>
@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org you should add it to the agenda now, you can always add slides later

sorry i'm late; what have i missed so far?

[10:26:25.0585] <Michael Ficarra>
the thing on screen, that's it

[10:27:47.0897] <ljharb>
lol ok

[10:33:13.0767] <Michael Ficarra>
whenever `eval` comes up, I just tune out because I couldn't give a single fuck about what happens once someone invokes `eval`

[10:33:17.0842] <Michael Ficarra>
it may as well be UB

[12:50:48.0203] <Mathieu Hofman>
eval doesn't have to be evil ;)

but it only takes one bitflip to make it so

Don’t most of your customers’ sites not have csp on, or configured properly?

last I looked, most sites period don't have CSP on or configured properly

Right, so isn’t eval pretty relevant?

[06:08:20.0287] <Michael Ficarra>
you're assuming that's intentional rather than either them not caring about CSP, not being aware of CSP, or CSP being incredibly hard to not screw up

[06:09:42.0667] <Michael Ficarra>
also a lot of the directives are overly broad, so, until recently, you had to permit eval even to just run wasm fully sandboxed

[06:09:49.0005] <littledan>
I’m not assuming that, I just mean we need to worry about what happens when it happens 

[06:10:52.0603] <Michael Ficarra>
oh somebody, sure, just not me

[06:13:44.0580] <littledan>
(I am in the eval is evil camp fwiw)

[06:14:38.0756] <littledan>
(Was certainly necessary historically of course)

[07:07:06.0568] <Michael Ficarra>
IMO new things like dynamic eval shouldn't even work within eval

[07:07:22.0509] <Michael Ficarra>
probably the only reason they do is because it simplifies engines

[07:07:32.0396] <Michael Ficarra>
* IMO new things like dynamic import shouldn't even work within eval
