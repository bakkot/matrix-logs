per our last meeting, the group agreed that it would be helpful to have a set agenda in advance of meetings.  to that end, I have updated the template and created the md for next week's meeting.

**next week's meeting is our last meeting before plenary**

we have an agenda but feel free to add to it.  that said, we will want to prioritize the vulnerability disclosure policy topic because it directly relates to our report to TG1.  (the report content is also on the agenda for us to update/review and will be a priority topic as well.)

there is a slight change in format in the agenda/notes template, but notably we are still using one `.md` file for both the agenda and the meeting notes, and they continue to live at `tg3/meetings/notes`.
