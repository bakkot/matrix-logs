Following up on Kris' comment, expanding globals came up during the work on resizable ArrayBuffer when the proposal used separate constructors. That seemed unnecessary (every option can't be a new constructor... that's what constructor options objects  are for). But there was also a runtime memory cost per-global in XS, made it preferable to minimize globals. Shu (who championed the resizable ArrayBuffer work) and I agreed to explore two paths: (1) revisiting V8's security concerns that had led to separate constructors and (2) eliminating the per global RAM use in XS. Shu was able to resolve the security concerns so we could use an options object with ArrayBuffer constructor for resizing and Patrick was able to modify XS to eliminate the per-global memory cost. Best of all possible worlds. So... that proposal didn't end up adding new globals and there's now no runtime cost to having more (preloaded) globals with XS. Still, some of us might prefer to avoid adding lots of globals to the language...
