I see no topics on the agenda for this Wednesday’s meeting. The folks at Agoric need to exploit this valuable time slot to do a brainstorm before Mathieu Hofman’s planned time away, so I move that we cancel this week, or Chris de Almeida or ljharb might convene without us.

I actually can’t be there anyways; I’ll be on a plane to a funeral
