Mathieu Hofman: We really need to work on Promise security soon: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-defer-import-eval/pull/77

[14:18:47.0636] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Happy to present that PR this Wed if there is interest

[15:12:01.0610] <Mathieu Hofman>
I really haven't had time to spend on TC39 in the past couple months. I can try to make it to TG3 this Wednesday if both Justin Ridgewell and nicolo-ribaudo can be there. In particular the problem the PR above tries to solve, would it be solved by what I presented a few plenaries ago?

I should be able to make it.

https://github.com/tc39/proposal-native-promise-adoption would solve this, it’s basically implementing it for this specific case

I've mentioned this to Matthew Gaudet who's also interested in promise security, he'll hopefully be able to attend. I may be able to drop in for the second part of the meeting, I have a conflict at the beginning.

(I plan on attending; promise security is relevant to my interests. I'm also planning on presenting at plenary next time, basically this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vv3wATkfPaRs_pJnAlPqoVHIXq4fdslpgUny7zyUnnU/edit?usp=sharing)
