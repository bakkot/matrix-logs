Mathieu Hofman: We really need to work on Promise security soon: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-defer-import-eval/pull/77

Happy to present that PR this Wed if there is interest

I really haven't had time to spend on TC39 in the past couple months. I can try to make it to TG3 this Wednesday if both Justin Ridgewell and nicolo-ribaudo can be there. In particular the problem the PR above tries to solve, would it be solved by what I presented a few plenaries ago?

I should be able to make it.

https://github.com/tc39/proposal-native-promise-adoption would solve this, it’s basically implementing it for this specific case
