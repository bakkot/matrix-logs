sorry i couldn’t make it today (until just now), i assume it ended early?

we concluded that, if ron were to push one proposal, for purposes of reducing language security hazards, between regex buffer bounds and regex atomics, we’d pick buffer bounds but love both

👍️ buffer bounds would be great and are sorely needed
