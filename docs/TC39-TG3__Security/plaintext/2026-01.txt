sorry i couldn’t make it today (until just now), i assume it ended early?

[10:45:38.0155] <kriskowal>
we had a good run and ended apparently, moments before you arrived

we concluded that, if ron were to push one proposal, for purposes of reducing language security hazards, between regex buffer bounds and regex atomics, we’d pick buffer bounds but love both

[10:53:16.0017] <Michael Ficarra>
👍️ buffer bounds would be great and are sorely needed

gah, forgot to share these thoughts from David Wheeler:

- Also, while atomic operators are nice, it’d be MUCH better if JavaScript required that regex engines NEVER backtracked unless the regex requires it (e.g., by using a backreference).
- This would imply that they’d need to implement a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) as well as an NFA, and use the DFA unless the user specifically required something that cannot be implemented without backtracking like a backreference (at which point you use the NFA).
- If the implementation never backtracked, then redos disappears as a vulnerability.
- That would mean that redos vulnerabilities would be immediately eliminated in nearly all cases, by default, without developers needing to do anything special.
- In security, what matters is the default; if we can change systems so the default is secure, that will be FAR more helpful than an obscure atomic operation that users must specially invoke to use.
