In conclusion, the interpretation above is one of two possible interpretations, each with their own pros and cons, both of which seem to follow from ESM phase imports as proposed. So, we need to established whether either of the interpretations is satisfying, and we may need to bring in Caridy to answer to the viability of the approach not presented. We’ll reconvene on the topic of conditional advancement of ESM source phase imports to 2.7 a fortnight hence.
