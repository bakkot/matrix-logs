tc39 should specify an open source registry of downleveling techniques so that bundler implementors can work together towards better runtime reference security in their emitted utils

we need a more ergonomic way to call `call(...)` that isn't `const call = Function.prototype.call.bind(Function.prototype.call)`

[18:18:49.0906] <Eli Grey>
`globalThis.call` and `globalThis.apply`

[18:37:43.0566] <Mathieu Hofman>
Well there's already `Reflect.apply`

I typically use `const call = Date.call.bind(Date.call);`

the bind operator proposal, or the call this proposal, can provide that
