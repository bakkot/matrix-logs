no agenda for today?

[09:51:32.0923] <Mathieu Hofman>
I think there was continuation of the comparison topic

[10:06:32.0508] <kriskowal>
Pinging Jacob Smith if you wish to continue the diff compare topic.

[10:07:55.0976] <Jacob Smith>
Oh crap. It wasn't added to my cal. I can jump on

[10:40:12.0945] <Jacob Smith>
Sorry i thought ~30 mins would be enough time before dinner was ready

[10:40:33.0682] <Mathieu Hofman>
Sorry we should never have started the error conversation 

[10:40:51.0603] <Jacob Smith>
* Sorry i thought ~30 mins would be enough time before dinner was ready (since nothing else was on the agenda)

[10:40:56.0797] <Mathieu Hofman>
I thought it'd be a quick topic while you joined

[10:42:00.0612] <kriskowal>
Apologies, Jacob. I should have moved this topic to second 30 when you joined.

for the Error stack setter - i don't think we discussed whether it can throw if a non-string is assigned to it (the other options are, assign whatever the value is, or, coerce to string)

[12:14:00.0314] <Mathieu Hofman>
Would love to see a report of the accessor behaviors across engines today.

Another thing to add to the list of existing stack accessor behaviors to test: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-stack-accessor/issues/13, whether setting the stack updates the internal data. We broached the topic last week, but felt comfortable with the shadowing behavior. I think I could be convinced to clear the internal data if (aka after) defining the stack property on the target succeeds.

[13:17:15.0607] <Mathieu Hofman>
I think it also has impact on the value returned by the getter for non error objects. Should the getter outcome distinguish between non-error objects and error objects that had their internal stack data cleared.

[13:27:38.0518] <Mathieu Hofman>
I am tempted to say that the stack getter should just return an empty string in all those cases.

[18:12:06.0454] <ljharb>
i would not ever want the original data to be cleared

[18:12:17.0096] <ljharb>
the original accessor must always be able to expose the immutable internal slot

[18:17:22.0520] <Mathieu Hofman>
I see the stack being a getter mostly as an explicit optimization for lazily processing stack info when needed. As such I'm not super concerned with the fact that overriding the stack would explicitly disable that lazy mechanism, but I honestly don't have a strong opinion either way at this point. 

[18:32:41.0946] <kriskowal>
Jacob Smith lmk if you’d like to cover deep difference of object graphs, by whatever name, at tomorrow’s meeting.

[18:32:54.0178] <kriskowal>
I think we’ll otherwise open the floor to discuss proposals for next week’s plenary.

[00:35:37.0601] <Justin Ridgewell>
Why though?

[00:38:42.0924] <Olivier Flückiger>
Also, that is not what V8 is doing right now. Once you set the stack property we will collect that memory. I don't really know how important that is, but I did hear nightmare stories of big websites leaking their whole application state through error objects :) That is where my worries come from...

[00:49:20.0140] <Olivier Flückiger>
So I guess my question is, what would be the argument against the setter also writing undefined into the internal slot should there be such a slot on the receiver...

[00:51:42.0821] <Olivier Flückiger>
* So I guess my question is, what would be the argument against the setter also writing undefined (or whatever constant) into the internal slot should there be such a slot on the receiver...

[00:57:49.0295] <Mathieu Hofman>
I personally don't have any, as long as that happens only after successfully defining the own stack property.

[01:03:49.0432] <Justin Ridgewell>
I think that would be fine.

[05:24:22.0022] <dminor>
That makes sense to me.

[05:44:59.0708] <ljharb>
because that's how every internal slot works, for one. but also because the stack trace is the thing that makes it an error

[05:45:10.0272] <ljharb>
v8 is doing a bunch of stuff around error stacks right now that need fixing.

[05:46:21.0857] <Olivier Flückiger>
"The only specified use of [[ErrorData]] is [...] to identify Error" https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-error-instances

[05:46:24.0429] <ljharb>
* v8 is doing a bunch of stuff around error stacks right now that need fixing. for example, the hidden intrinsic own accessor property on every error instance

[05:46:47.0616] <ljharb>
i'm not talking about the spec, which doesn't discuss stacks at all right now - but about actual semantics in practice

[05:46:52.0800] <ljharb>
`new Error()` is the only way to get a stack trace

[05:46:58.0764] <Olivier Flückiger>
So currently in Ecma262 errors do not have a stack trace. Many engines will give you one. And at least two engines will allow you to remove it again...

[05:47:09.0687] <ljharb>
sure

[05:47:26.0680] <ljharb>
which means there's no web compat angle forcing a direction, which means we should do the normal thing for the language.

[05:47:55.0083] <ljharb>
and that's an immutable slot determined at instantiation time, with a prototype accessor to read it

[05:48:05.0552] <ljharb>
the setter only exists in the proposal for web compatibility, otherwise there wouldn't be one

[05:50:12.0576] <Olivier Flückiger>
Only this might turn out to be half-webcompatible. As in it behaves semantically like before, but pragmatically it might use up all your applications memory...

[05:54:47.0956] <ljharb>
i would be very surprised if a string attached to an error object used up lots of memory - what long-running application is going to keep error instances around, but the *string* is the thing that uses too much memory?

[05:54:57.0136] <ljharb>
* i would be very surprised if a string attached to an error object used up lots of memory - what long-running application is going to keep error instances around, but a _string_ is the thing that uses too much memory?

[05:55:08.0696] <ljharb>
tbh i just don't see how that's a remotely meaningful concern

[05:55:38.0075] <Olivier Flückiger>
ah, that's the thing. we don't have a string there. but some internal representation of the stack

[05:55:49.0668] <Olivier Flückiger>
that is for example accessible to formatStackTrace

[05:55:56.0447] <ljharb>
you don't need to keep that once the stack is fetched tho - just the string

[05:56:12.0628] <ljharb>
or at least, the JS spec isn't forcing that

[05:56:24.0006] <ljharb>
(i don't know what formatStackTrace is)

[05:57:41.0385] <ljharb>
(ironically v8 is the one that blocked the structured stack trace proposal back in like 2018 for reasons unrelated to this convo, so i'm surprised they now have a stack structure with important use cases)

[06:00:28.0323] <Olivier Flückiger>
ookay. I mean we can write spec text all day. I am just pointing out what might cause difficulties shipping it...

[06:00:40.0906] <Olivier Flückiger>
(prepareStackTrace I meant)

[06:03:22.0751] <ljharb>
totally, i appreciate you bringing it up

[06:03:29.0739] <ljharb>
i'm just trying to understand why it would make a difference

[06:04:06.0175] <ljharb>
like, can you describe the long-running web app where it keeps around error instances, nulls out the stack trace, and where the weight of the underlying stack structure sticking around would be punitive?

[06:04:35.0662] <ljharb>
i've been doing web dev for a long long time and while indeed devs do all sorts of wacky stuff, i can't even conceive of how such an application could come into existence or what it'd do

[06:05:25.0757] <ljharb>
* like, can you describe the long-running web app where it keeps around error instances, nulls out the stack trace, and where the weight of the underlying stack structure sticking around would be punitive? (but the weight of the error instances would not be)

[06:07:24.0450] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Just an idea but I don't actually want to be involved in this discussion so I won't defend it: maybe V8 could stringify the stack trace (calling .prepareStackTrace) when the setter runs (similarly to how it does it when the getter runs), and then store the string?

[06:09:50.0222] <Olivier Flückiger>
yeah, that would be the obvious solution, if we didn't have https://v8.dev/docs/stack-trace-api#customizing-stack-traces

[06:10:05.0517] <Olivier Flückiger>
but we do and that is another web reality unfortunately
