no agenda for today?

[09:51:32.0923] <Mathieu Hofman>
I think there was continuation of the comparison topic

[10:06:32.0508] <kriskowal>
Pinging Jacob Smith if you wish to continue the diff compare topic.

[10:07:55.0976] <Jacob Smith>
Oh crap. It wasn't added to my cal. I can jump on

[10:40:12.0945] <Jacob Smith>
Sorry i thought ~30 mins would be enough time before dinner was ready

[10:40:33.0682] <Mathieu Hofman>
Sorry we should never have started the error conversation 

[10:40:51.0603] <Jacob Smith>
* Sorry i thought ~30 mins would be enough time before dinner was ready (since nothing else was on the agenda)

[10:40:56.0797] <Mathieu Hofman>
I thought it'd be a quick topic while you joined

[10:42:00.0612] <kriskowal>
Apologies, Jacob. I should have moved this topic to second 30 when you joined.

for the Error stack setter - i don't think we discussed whether it can throw if a non-string is assigned to it (the other options are, assign whatever the value is, or, coerce to string)

Would love to see a report of the accessor behaviors across engines today.

Another thing to add to the list of existing stack accessor behaviors to test: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-stack-accessor/issues/13, whether setting the stack updates the internal data. We broached the topic last week, but felt comfortable with the shadowing behavior. I think I could be convinced to clear the internal data if (aka after) defining the stack property on the target succeeds.

[13:17:15.0607] <Mathieu Hofman>
I think it also has impact on the value returned by the getter for non error objects. Should the getter outcome distinguish between non-error objects and error objects that had their internal stack data cleared.

[13:27:38.0518] <Mathieu Hofman>
I am tempted to say that the stack getter should just return an empty string in all those cases.
