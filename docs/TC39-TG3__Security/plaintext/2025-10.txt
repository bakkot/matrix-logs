Thank you for making time for me. I've put together a pull request here: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-capturestacktrace/pull/10, that could serve as a starting point for the conversation. I'll also try to socialize this with the V8 and JSC teams prior to the next meeting.

Hi, I can't make it tonight as this is quite late for me. Some points regarding the captureStackTrace discussion:

[07:28:08.0219] <Olivier FlÃ¼ckiger>
* I like the proposal giving implementers choice over accessor vs. data property very much. It reflects web reality and there are good reasons for both choices.

[07:28:50.0021] <Olivier FlÃ¼ckiger>
* We can change our setter to not write to the private field in V8. That should not be a problem.

[07:35:06.0280] <Olivier FlÃ¼ckiger>
* I was pointed at https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-stack-accessor and if we shouldn't rather follow that proposal, such that normal Errors and custom error objects end up behaving the same? In particular that one already did solve the problem with the setter.

Update: We can't because you can call `captureStackTrace` with any object and proto. But we should at least make sure they are close.

Right, they are aligned in the behaviors of the setter. And a data property is explainable as the setter having been invoked.
