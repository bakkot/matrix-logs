Our Agoric contingent is gathered at an undisclosed physical location and won’t be here for TG3 today. Looking forward to seeing you all again soon.

I thought y'all were past security by obscurity

Best alternative for a physical membrane ;)

Frankly, we’re just embarrassed that we subjected ourselves to a location that is so hostile to living things.

Like an office, or something?

HTTP on length requirements: 

https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-length-requirements
> HTTP does not have specific length limitations for many of its protocol elements because the lengths that might be appropriate will vary widely, depending on the deployment context and purpose of the implementation. Hence, interoperability between senders and recipients depends on shared expectations regarding what is a reasonable length for each protocol element. Furthermore, what is commonly understood to be a reasonable length for some protocol elements has changed over the course of the past three decades of HTTP use and is expected to continue changing in the future.

https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-uri-references
> It is RECOMMENDED that all senders and recipients support, at a minimum, URIs with lengths of 8000 octets in protocol elements. Note that this implies some structures and on-wire representations (for example, the request line in HTTP/1.1) will necessarily be larger in some cases.
