next meeting is now on the calendar for next week on Tuesday/Wednesday. this is the APAC-friendly meeting time at:

- 18:00 Pacific US, Tuesday
- 03:00 Central Europe, Wednesday
- 09:00 China, Wednesday

I invited the few people directly to the calendar invite who asked to be invited on the last meeting, but please let me know if you want to be explicitly invited on the calendar.

I will be asking the SES folks this week for the 2nd Wednesday each month for the EMEA-friendly meeting
