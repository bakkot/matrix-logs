ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ANNOUNCEMENTðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢Starting tomorrow, TC54 will be starting a 12 week series to review the CycloneDX 1.6 specification ([PDF](https://cyclonedx.slack.com/files/UVA903BGD/F06KMBS5Z34/ecma-tc54-_cdx-1.6_.pdf?origin_team=TVA8FS80G&origin_channel=CV062H2GH)) in its entirety as part of the standardization process. We will look to ensure technical rigor AND a widely shared understanding of whatâ€™s being standardized.
