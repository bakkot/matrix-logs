Where do I find the video conference link for today's meeting?

https://github.com/tc39/tg3#meetings

☝️   and it's also on the TC39 calendar

FWIW – my mistake was checking the meeting agenda page and expecting to find the meeting video link there.

[09:56:05.0451] <Chris de Almeida>
ah.  yeah, maybe we should add the link there as well

[10:02:03.0856] <ljharb>
(i won't be there today; i have to attend a conflicting meeting)

[12:55:16.0372] <phoddie (Peter Hoddie)>
Chris de Almeida: That would be nice. If it helps with maintaining things, it would be enough to just link to the tg3#meetings section from the agenda instead of providing the link. Anyway.... I made it to the call this time, so that counts as success. Thanks for your help.

I'd like to bring back Array.isTemplateObject some time. This proposal is good for supporting security via trusted types (which are difficult to deploy without it) but the concern raised in the past was also around security (membrane-ability) https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-is-template-object/issues/10

[15:13:37.0301] <littledan>
IMO the proposal as it's currently spec'd should be good to go, and we shouldn't make changes which make the test realm-specific. These changes wouldn't really enhance usability in any way (it would just make the predicates consistently not work across realms, instead of only being broken by a membrane), and when Igalia tried to implement them, they found that it was quite difficult in WebKit and Firefox.

Here's the thread where Igalia went to great lengths to try to implement the semantics that Mark had recommended, but found them to be impractical: https://github.com/w3c/trusted-types/issues/412
