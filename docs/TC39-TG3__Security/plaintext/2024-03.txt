https://github.com/tc39/tg3#meetings

☝️   and it's also on the TC39 calendar

FWIW – my mistake was checking the meeting agenda page and expecting to find the meeting video link there.

[09:56:05.0451] <Chris de Almeida>
ah.  yeah, maybe we should add the link there as well

(i won't be there today; i have to attend a conflicting meeting)

[12:55:16.0372] <phoddie (Peter Hoddie)>
Chris de Almeida: That would be nice. If it helps with maintaining things, it would be enough to just link to the tg3#meetings section from the agenda instead of providing the link. Anyway.... I made it to the call this time, so that counts as success. Thanks for your help.
