I’m unable to join the webex “another meeting is in progress”.

[10:01:55.0642] <ljharb>
hm, it's letting me in

Seems to be a “me” issue. I need to figure out how to leave the meeting I’m not in.

next week i'll be at RSA conf so i won't be at TG3.

I got a regular conflict that I had with this meeting moved (it wasn't signals; it was something else) so I can hopefully come next week

[12:18:34.0063] <littledan>
are all SES meetings now TG3 meetings instead?

[12:42:23.0989] <ljharb>
yup
