I‚Äôm unable to join the webex ‚Äúanother meeting is in progress‚Äù.

[10:01:55.0642] <ljharb>
hm, it's letting me in

[10:02:44.0645] <kriskowal>
Seems to be a ‚Äúme‚Äù issue. I need to figure out how to leave the meeting I‚Äôm not in.

[10:13:25.0223] <ljharb>
next week i'll be at RSA conf so i won't be at TG3.

[12:18:13.0227] <littledan>
I got a regular conflict that I had with this meeting moved (it wasn't signals; it was something else) so I can hopefully come next week

[12:18:34.0063] <littledan>
are all SES meetings now TG3 meetings instead?

[12:42:23.0989] <ljharb>
yup

re: curentComputed in the Signals proposal -- what I was trying to get at earlier was that, with AsyncContext in the picture, each framework would be able to make their own variables for whatever dynamic stuff they needed. AFAIK the global accessibility isn't vital to anyone's use cases; well-behaved frameworks would only ever be asking "is the Computed that's running one of mine?" and then reading their own separate properties off of it from there.

(currentComputed is one of a couple of things in the current proposal that are "sufficient but not minimal" for enabling certain use patterns; introspection is another. I think thinking about the security invariants is definitely a good way for us to search for better-behaved primitives for those uses.)

[15:14:07.0598] <Mathieu Hofman>
I filed https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals/issues/219 to help think about some cross-realm issues of signals, which I think have a lot to do with current computed and how dependency graphs are created

Is there a standard process for adding TG3 agenda items? It would be great to get feedback on the latest JS module source design.

[16:33:59.0693] <ljharb>
huh, good point. we don't have an agenda doc for upcoming meetings.

if you want to make a PR that creates one (cribbing from the last one), that seems like it'll work :-)

[16:40:52.0239] <Chris de Almeida>
I normally do this and I've been slacking.  apologies

this will have to suffice for now.  if not today, then if there is a particular week that you want to discuss, let us know and we will schedule it accordingly.=

[09:03:28.0032] <Chris de Almeida>
I will not be able to attend today

[10:17:33.0117] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Aaand my browser crashed, I'm not taking minutes anymore
