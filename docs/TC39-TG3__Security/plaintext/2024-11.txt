be right there

[10:06:56.0087] <ljharb>
only Nicolo and i are here. Is this meeting happening?

[10:07:32.0170] <kriskowal>
we got to 5 after without topics and adjourned

[10:07:46.0495] <kriskowal>
if you were there the whole time, it‚Äôs possible that we were in different rooms

[10:08:42.0601] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I joined at :05

[10:08:52.0897] <ljharb>
We joined 5 after, off the calendar

[10:10:41.0907] <kriskowal>
alright, looks like we didn‚Äôt have a glitch and just missed each other seconds apart, alas

[10:11:33.0405] <kriskowal>
if we missed an opportunity to discuss a topic, this would be a good time to populate the agenda for next week on tc39/tg3

[10:11:57.0984] <ljharb>
nothing specific. Let‚Äôs ping matrix next time before adjourning tho :-)

[12:55:58.0647] <littledan>
At some point, it'd be good to have Signals on the agenda

[12:56:04.0112] <littledan>
but I keep missing this meeting...

[12:57:49.0460] <kriskowal>
Managing the agenda could be lighter weight. I may propose we resume the SES Google Doc for agenda building so one of the conveners can roll that up into creating a meeting issue.

[12:58:40.0626] <kriskowal>
Or we can coordinate topics here, with a convener taking the ball to build the issue.

[12:58:41.0426] <nicolo-ribaudo>
What is the current process? The hackmd?

[12:59:04.0941] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I usually just write things in the hackmd but I have no idea if it's what I'm expected to do

[12:59:14.0666] <kriskowal>
Currently the process is the first proposer of a topic has to create a PR to create the meeting notes.

[12:59:40.0823] <kriskowal>
I‚Äôm not clear on the hackmd persistence

[13:00:24.0202] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Well I was assuming we'd copy its contents to the persistent notes!

[13:00:30.0561] <kriskowal>
But if we have a rolling hackmd that we copy into the github only after the meeting minutes are captured, that is fine, provided we leave the hackmd link somewhere durable and editable to delegates

[13:01:22.0063] <kriskowal>
That is, hackmd is just as lightweight as google doc and i‚Äôm fine with using it as the source of truth for agenda building

[13:25:46.0908] <Chris de Almeida>
the hackmd is persistent and is meant to be the upcoming agenda -- so long as it's not displaying the previous week's info

[13:26:09.0218] <Chris de Almeida>
> <@kriskowal:aelf.land> But if we have a rolling hackmd that we copy into the github only after the meeting minutes are captured, that is fine, provided we leave the hackmd link somewhere durable and editable to delegates

that is the current state of affairs

where can we put the agenda edit link where everyone who needs it can find it and it doesn‚Äôt get griefed by randos?

[10:02:48.0887] <kriskowal>
i know we aspire to put the invitation on the public calendar, but perhaps it should have a reflection on a calendar that is accessible only to delegates, because the invitation for the meeting is where i believe most folks will look for the meeting docs

[10:03:13.0354] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Refector issue, and link to the reflector from the calendar event?

[10:47:57.0765] <Chris de Almeida>
yeah, reflector is really the only good place, and we can just link to the reflector from the TG3 repo.  or we can restrict access to the doc, that might actually be easier and better

[11:10:24.0762] <kriskowal>
Sgtm, calendar link to reflector link to hackmd.

[12:07:26.0614] <Chris de Almeida>
hmm, there's a snag.  the agenda needs to be public

[12:07:53.0988] <Chris de Almeida>
so this probably needs to get fixed with access control

[12:08:31.0775] <kriskowal>
does hackmd do edit vs view facet capability urls?

[12:09:43.0168] <Chris de Almeida>
yeah, but looks like it only requires users to be logged in, doesn't seem there's any way to have an allowlist of writers

[12:10:57.0365] <kriskowal>

> The default limit for editing permissions on notes is 3 people. If you upgrade to the HackMD Prime Personal Plan or Team Plan, you can enjoy an unlimited number of editors!

[12:11:54.0149] <Chris de Almeida>
üòë

[12:39:14.0196] <ljharb>
do we really need to worry about randos yet?

[13:34:40.0792] <Chris de Almeida>
we could try it and see, while at least requiring users to be logged in

[09:47:06.0463] <Chris de Almeida>
meeting in ~13 mins

[09:48:27.0549] <ulises.gascon>
I won't be able to join today

[11:24:14.0930] <Chris de Almeida>
the agenda is now set to only allow logged in users to write to it.  anon read is still allowed
