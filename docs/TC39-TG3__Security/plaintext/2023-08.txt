ðŸ“¢ reminder we have our EMEA-friendly meeting today/tomorrow:

```
| US / Central | 12:00 Wednesday |
|          UTC | 17:00 Wednesday |
|        China | 01:00 Thursday  |
```

this will be the first instance where we are not mostly going through previous agenda items to see if they are still relevant to the group

we have a sizable [backlog of items](https://github.com/tc39/tg3/blob/main/meetings/agendas/backlog.md) but nothing specifically called out to be discussed today

is there anything in particular folks want to tackle first?  perhaps more importantly, is there anything time-sensitive that we need to discuss sooner rather than later?

sorry I feel not good so I may not come today. Hope there is a meeting note I can see the discussion later! (btw it's also midnight for me)
