ðŸ“¢ reminder we have our EMEA-friendly meeting today/tomorrow:

```
| US / Central | 12:00 Wednesday |
|          UTC | 17:00 Wednesday |
|        China | 01:00 Thursday  |
```

this will be the first instance where we are not mostly going through previous agenda items to see if they are still relevant to the group

we have a sizable [backlog of items](https://github.com/tc39/tg3/blob/main/meetings/agendas/backlog.md) but nothing specifically called out to be discussed today

is there anything in particular folks want to tackle first?  perhaps more importantly, is there anything time-sensitive that we need to discuss sooner rather than later?

sorry I feel not good so I may not come today. Hope there is a meeting note I can see the discussion later! (btw it's also midnight for me)

if I had to choose a priority topic, I would pick getting the vulnerability disclosure process set up and publicly documented

[08:17:52.0573] <Michael Ficarra>
or maybe reviewing in-progress proposals to see which ones we would recommend for security review/sign-off by TG3 participants

[08:18:14.0322] <Chris de Almeida>
that's top of mind for me as well!  I wanted to defer to the group rather than make a unilateral decision, so I'm happy with that (but also open to anything else, especially if timely)

> or maybe reviewing in-progress proposals to see which ones we would recommend for security review/sign-off by TG3 participants

also a good option.  specifically, shared structs proposal review is in the backlog (though it doesn't have to be that one).  

there is also the meta-issue on the topic of security reviews for proposals from a process perspective
