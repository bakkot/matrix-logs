Hi! Next week 9/10, I'm planning to join TG3 to discuss the internal slots issue. I can't make it today.

I’ll spread the word.

[10:56:02.0248] <Chris de Almeida>
did TG3 convene today?

[10:56:17.0976] <kriskowal>
We’re convened. About to wrap up.

[10:56:53.0075] <kriskowal>
We’ve had a discussion on spec algorithms that consult internal slots of arguments and practical membrane transparency.

[11:04:44.0237] <Michael Ficarra>
aww, bummed I couldn't make it

I’m capturing notes on mitigation for Shai-Hulud here https://github.com/endojs/endo/wiki/Mitigating-Postinstall-Attacks-like-the-Shai%E2%80%90Hulud-Worm

[11:42:04.0744] <Michael Ficarra>
I don't see mention of the obvious thing from the npm blog post:

> If you are installing a package that you do not trust, you can avoid this vulnerability by running
> 
> npm install --ignore-scripts
> 
> If you wish to never run scripts at install time, you can instead run
> 
> npm config set ignore-scripts true

[11:59:21.0140] <Mathieu Hofman>
Is it realistic in large projects to disable install scripts wholesale? I thought these did legitimately show up here and there. 

[12:00:25.0536] <kriskowal>
It’s not really practical, but it’s a mechanism that LavaMoat allow-scripts sets up and then makes pinholes for specific ones. So, you’ve got a list of packages to carefully audit.

[13:06:23.0312] <Mathieu Hofman>
Right. My point being that I don't see package manager configs fully disabling install scripts as being a practical solution for some projects

[13:44:09.0031] <Chris de Almeida>
you're right
