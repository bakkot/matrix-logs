If anyone is looking for possible upstream work, the most important bugs with the current polyfill are probably making unwatch faster https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals/issues/215 and deduplicating things from watch https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals/issues/157

I would like to invite the Signals champion group to join us at a regular meeting of #tc39-tg3-security:matrix.org to talk shop. That meeting is on the TC39 calendar on Wednesdays for Americas and Europe. Iâ€™d be obliged to strike up an email thread for scheduling if you can message me email addys.
