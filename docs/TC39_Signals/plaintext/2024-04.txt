Hello everyone!

[11:04:25.0761] <Chris de Almeida>
is the bot in the room with us right now?  ðŸ‘€

[11:04:46.0025] <littledan>
doesn't look like it

[11:06:48.0382] <Chris de Almeida>
it takes a bit

[11:08:32.0863] <littledan>
Is there any way we could set the signals logo as the avatar to the room?
