Hello everyone!

[11:04:25.0761] <Chris de Almeida>
is the bot in the room with us right now?  ðŸ‘€

[11:04:46.0025] <littledan>
doesn't look like it

[11:06:48.0382] <Chris de Almeida>
it takes a bit

[11:08:32.0863] <littledan>
Is there any way we could set the signals logo as the avatar to the room?

[11:08:52.0901] <littledan>
fine if it's a little cropped

Thank you!

irrationally bothering me that the lights are not evenly spaces in the logo

I'm surprised that you're the first person to point it out

[11:12:46.0045] <littledan>
small format logo (suitable for this context) in progress

[11:13:13.0748] <littledan>
also we can still iterate on this; any feedback is welcome

[11:14:24.0818] <littledan>
PRs welcome to put this in various places (but unfortunately I don't have the SVG yet)

[11:14:51.0645] <littledan>
my favorite part about this logo is the way the oval tapers down just slightly 

[11:14:55.0748] <littledan>
it creates some movement

[11:14:55.0778] <Chris de Almeida>
can we get the lights horizontally aligned?
