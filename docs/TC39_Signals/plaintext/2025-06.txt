Students from the University of Bergen have been working on a project porting tests from popular Signals libraries and running them against the current polyfill! They are asking for some advice from the community on what to do with this fork they've been working on https://github.com/proposal-signals/signal-polyfill/issues/53

I agree with the points here: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals/issues/256#issuecomment-2608641411
keeping hold of the previously seen value seems like a local optimization for a less commmon use case that leads to a global deoptimization

We've discussed this at a few of the recent meetings! I think a few people have expressed a philosophical agreement of "Signals do as few computes as possible" and this previous value cache idea. I'm putting together a small survey of items I'd love temperature checks on and this will be one of them!

As a philosophy that seems too narrow focused. Memory tends to be a harder limit than computation
