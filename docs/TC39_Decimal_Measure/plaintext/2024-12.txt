Hi, everyone! Thanks Chris for making this room! I've been in a lot of DMs and other different communication channels with different subsets of people regarding the Decimal and Measure proposals, so I thought we would benefit from a single forum to talk and plan.

I had a good conversation with nicolo-ribaudo after the session I hosted in the December plenary. Basically, I would really like to see these proposals advance together as soon as possible. It might not seem like it, but I feel we are the closest we've been to getting a proposal that everyone on the committee is happy about.

It looks from the outside that we've been going in circles, but I describe it more as a helix: when we go back to the shape of a proposal we've had before, we arrive there with more stakeholders and a much more foolproof specification and understanding of the problem space.

thanks for setting up this room! I think it makes sense to have a common place to discuss

[01:26:19.0960] <Jesse>
I also agree that what appears to be circular motion is actually progress

[01:27:14.0063] <Jesse>
having measure & decimal move together makes a lot of sense
