happy new year everyone! I'm getting back in the saddle after the holidays and a vacation (my daughters had all of last week off, iow a 3-week break)

[07:15:43.0798] <Jesse>
I've been noodling the idea of a combined measure & decimal proposal

[07:16:22.0538] <Jesse>
here's a gist that offers up some (skeleton) insight into one approach I can see:

as always, the names of things are very much subject to bikesheeding

[07:17:58.0547] <Jesse>
there are a few parameters in the design space that could be tweaked; this gist covers just one of them

the gist above offers three classes: measure plus a normalized and "full" Decimal128

I've sketched another variant of the decimal + measure idea, this time with two new classes, one for Measure and another, `Decimal`, for normalized Decimal128
