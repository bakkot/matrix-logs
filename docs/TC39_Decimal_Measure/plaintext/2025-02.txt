Looking over and considering Jesse's upcoming Decimal/Measure presentation and explainer, I get the sense that we really ought to find a way to reach the end goals here in multiple smaller steps, rather than one big leap. By Decimal normalising trailing zeros, the use cases for them introduce a dependency on Measure, but it gets a bit hairy if Measure then also depends on Decimal for its value representation.

What if we were to initially not include _any_ conversions in Measure? Then we wouldn't need to change its inputs at all, and we would still be providing a way for Intl.NumberFormat and Intl.MessageFormat to get their formattable inputs as a combined value+units+precision package.

Then we could consider separately the Smart Units part of this whole thing adding unit conversions, and Decimal defining its accessors on Measure, and we'd avoid having everythin depend on everything else.

Here's a sketch of what that might look like: https://gist.github.com/eemeli/0bd413d2f711cbd6016673af8d68c38c

That's in TS, so the real thing would need to have appropriate runtime checks for the types. The lack of any methods on the class is quite intentional, as is freezing it.

I'm also starting to think that we might want to call this "Amount" rather than "Measure", mostly because then it also makes sense for currencies: it feels really clumsy to talk of a "measure of money", whereas an "amount of money" (or anything else, really) makes more sense.

thanks!

happy to discuss another name

"measure" suggests physical quantities and (it feels like) is excludes currencies; "amount" clearly includes currencies but (to my mind) weakly excludes other kinds of measurements

shouldn't we have a toLocaleString or at least toString in Amounts?
