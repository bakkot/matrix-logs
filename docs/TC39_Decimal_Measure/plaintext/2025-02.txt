Looking over and considering Jesse's upcoming Decimal/Measure presentation and explainer, I get the sense that we really ought to find a way to reach the end goals here in multiple smaller steps, rather than one big leap. By Decimal normalising trailing zeros, the use cases for them introduce a dependency on Measure, but it gets a bit hairy if Measure then also depends on Decimal for its value representation.

What if we were to initially not include _any_ conversions in Measure? Then we wouldn't need to change its inputs at all, and we would still be providing a way for Intl.NumberFormat and Intl.MessageFormat to get their formattable inputs as a combined value+units+precision package.

Then we could consider separately the Smart Units part of this whole thing adding unit conversions, and Decimal defining its accessors on Measure, and we'd avoid having everythin depend on everything else.
