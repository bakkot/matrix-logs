we could juggle the meetings times -- how shall we fix the conflict? Would meeting one hour later (10:00 am America/Los_Angeles) work?

No it needs to be one hour earlier but only in March. I can fix it.

[01:12:15.0321] <sffc>
Before and after. ⏱️

[01:25:55.0369] <Jesse>
that works for me -- how about for the others?

[01:34:02.0647] <eemeli>
I'll be on PTO for the next call and will miss it in either case.

[01:36:01.0987] <Jesse>
there's also a chance to discuss 402-specific aspects in the upcoming 402 call on Thursday

[02:43:04.0229] <eemeli>
FYI, my PTO starts this Thursday, so I'll miss this week's TG2 call as well.

any chance of moving this week's JS numerics call to Wednesday (currently Thursday)? I'll be away on Thursday (and Friday)

[09:06:46.0248] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ad an alternative we could switch to the other every other week, which would solve a monthly conflict I have with the TG4-scopes meeting :)

[09:08:43.0565] <Jesse>
I'm happy to do that -- any thoughts from the others?

[09:12:59.0465] <nicolo-ribaudo>
(sorry, changing topic, but please folks reply to the message above!)

Some calls have an agendas/notes doc linked to in the calendar event, such as https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CD5lIBZLl24XBWbQhokqBdt4Zl7wPAcFJKJrgePr9HU/edit?tab=t.0

Could we have something similar? I find it very useful to have a single place where I can check what folks want to talk about in advance

[09:14:44.0609] <Jesse>
I'll put together something like that, good idea thanks

Since we're talking about scheduling: <details> I also have a conflict about 50% of the time with the current time slot, the ICU4X Working Group, but it isn't evenly spaced. The time for that meeting derives from TC39-TG2 which derives from TC39-TG1 which is not a regular cadence. I do not have a conflict for the next 3 meeting slots. </details>

[09:57:22.0703] <Jesse>
if I understand the details correctly, it should be ok if our call were the same time, just one week later?

[09:57:46.0497] <Jesse>
(and the failure rate of 50% wouldn't increase)

[10:21:59.0653] <sffc>
If we switch the meeting to the other week, then I have a conflict for the next 3 meeting slots, and then OK after that for a while

it sounds like there's no optimal time for the next call. The options I can see are:

1. Proceed with the meeting as scheduled (with the understanding that I won't be there)
2. Have the call one day earlier, at the same time
3. Have the call one day later (doesn't work for me)
4. Skip this meeting, see you in 2 weeks & 2 days

Can you use an emoji to vote on this? There are emojis for numbers. You can vote for multiple options. A vote indicates that you're OK with the choice.

We didn't get around to fully discussing Rationals at the TG2 meeting, so I don't have a lot of updates on that front. I think the main thing for Amount is making a better case that we benefit from a new prototype for it rather than "just a protocol".

[01:23:46.0002] <sffc>
On Decimal itself, I should note that we still haven't fully discussed https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/181. Issues like that ought to have champion group consensus before asking for Stage 2.

[01:25:26.0833] <sffc>
I feel uncomfortable that there are 62 open issues on the repository. They should be at least triaged into broad categories like "blocks stage 2", "blocks stage 2.7/3", and "nice-to-have for later"

[01:29:06.0355] <sffc>
I want to hear a compelling case for "why we can't just have a Math.decimalAdd function" with behavior as described in that issue. I claim that the only _real_ reasons are ergonomics and the ability to represent more than 34 significant digits; in other words, nothing intrinsic about Decimal128. If that's true, fine, but let's be clear about it. And if ergonomics are the motivating factor, then let's make the ergonomics argument for Amount, too.

^ I guess what I'm trying to say is that, as champions, we should form consensus on the roadmap to Stage 2, including key issues to resolve and questions to answer. There was a small amount of backchannel discussion here and in Seattle, but we should turn that into action. Triaging issues into milestones is a great first step.
