we could juggle the meetings times -- how shall we fix the conflict? Would meeting one hour later (10:00 am America/Los_Angeles) work?

No it needs to be one hour earlier but only in March. I can fix it.

Before and after. ⏱️

[01:25:55.0369] <Jesse>
that works for me -- how about for the others?

[01:34:02.0647] <eemeli>
I'll be on PTO for the next call and will miss it in either case.

[01:36:01.0987] <Jesse>
there's also a chance to discuss 402-specific aspects in the upcoming 402 call on Thursday

[02:43:04.0229] <eemeli>
FYI, my PTO starts this Thursday, so I'll miss this week's TG2 call as well.

any chance of moving this week's JS numerics call to Wednesday (currently Thursday)? I'll be away on Thursday (and Friday)

Ad an alternative we could switch to the other every other week, which would solve a monthly conflict I have with the TG4-scopes meeting :)

[09:08:43.0565] <Jesse>
I'm happy to do that -- any thoughts from the others?

[09:12:59.0465] <nicolo-ribaudo>
(sorry, changing topic, but please folks reply to the message above!)

Some calls have an agendas/notes doc linked to in the calendar event, such as https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CD5lIBZLl24XBWbQhokqBdt4Zl7wPAcFJKJrgePr9HU/edit?tab=t.0

Could we have something similar? I find it very useful to have a single place where I can check what folks want to talk about in advance

[09:14:44.0609] <Jesse>
I'll put together something like that, good idea thanks

Since we're talking about scheduling: <details> I also have a conflict about 50% of the time with the current time slot, the ICU4X Working Group, but it isn't evenly spaced. The time for that meeting derives from TC39-TG2 which derives from TC39-TG1 which is not a regular cadence. I do not have a conflict for the next 3 meeting slots. </details>

[09:57:22.0703] <Jesse>
if I understand the details correctly, it should be ok if our call were the same time, just one week later?

[09:57:46.0497] <Jesse>
(and the failure rate of 50% wouldn't increase)
