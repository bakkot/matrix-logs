I'll be there. Should be able to share a draft of the spec changes for keep-trailing-zeros that I've been working on.

[05:39:23.0143] <eemeli>
Said spec draft: https://github.com/eemeli/ecma402/pull/1

I found it easier to start on the diff by working on a branch of the whole `ecma402` repo; is there any ecmarkup tooling that could take a git diff and generate the usual sort of proposal spec presentation from that?

well, it's trivial to just apply the diff and render the resulting spec—or did you have something else in mind, like translating `git diff --word-diff=plain` `[-removed-]`/`{+added+}` output into `<del>removed</del>`/`<ins>added</ins>`?

[05:50:56.0236] <eemeli>
Yes, to the latte question.

[05:50:59.0754] <eemeli>
* Yes, to the latter question.

[05:52:09.0926] <Jesse>
I'll be there

[05:52:15.0642] <eemeli>
Not having previously worked on a proposal that's more about changing existing text rather than adding new stuff, I figured I'd ask as I presume this type of thing happens on occasion.

[06:18:21.0415] <Jesse>
I've also got a PR for reducing the scope of measure in line with our earlier discussions: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-measure/pull/29

[07:51:41.0710] <eemeli>
Jesse: Added some comments on your PR.

[07:57:17.0785] <eemeli>
Jesse: In https://github.com/tc39/proposal-measure/pull/29 you're proposing that we drop units and currencies from the initial Amount? That seems surprisingly different from what we've been discussing so far.

[08:20:57.0738] <Jesse>
ah, right -- taking a look at the old notes, I realize I cut too much

[08:21:05.0965] <Jesse>
I'll restore units + currency

[08:21:07.0426] <Jesse>
sorry about that

[08:21:12.0838] <Jesse>
I'll restore units + currency

[08:22:25.0657] <Jesse>
in the spec text we do support units + currency, so the README and spec are out-of-sync

[04:41:13.0609] <Jesse>
taking a look at the issue of the Amount spec text not yet handling Intl.NumberFormat, it seems to me that no spec text is needed (!) provided that keep-trailing-zero is merged in

[04:44:20.0605] <Jesse>
the `FormatNumeric` AO seems to be doing the heavy lifting in NumberFormat; and given that the `ToPrimitive` AO will result in a call to `toString` on Amount objects (because there won't be a `.valueOf` method), it seems to me that, with Eemeli's bugfix, NumberFormat should work out-of-the-box with Amounts

[09:53:01.0307] <eemeli>
Well, not with Amounts that include a unit or currency. For those, the toString() output will not be parseable as a number, and the currency or unit in the Amount will be discarded.

[02:20:33.0109] <eemeli>
Regarding [this](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-measure/pull/29#discussion_r2182738311) short conversation between Jesse and myself, I've started to think that the default behaviour of `Amount.p.toString()` should be to return the numeric string with no unit/currency markers, so that e.g. `new Decimal(amount)` would work without any special Amount-detection code.

The with-marker behaviour could be implemented optionally, e.g. with `.toString({ style: 'long' })` where `style: 'numeric'` would be the default.

[02:37:28.0370] <eemeli>
I've added suggestions to the PR implementing the above.

[12:20:57.0749] <sffc>
* I strongly oppose a toString function having default behavior that is not round-trippable to the type it was created from, for a number of reasons. I didn't think this was a controversial position, but if it would help, I'll make another writeup like I did with #175 (why precision is important) and #181 (why Decimal isn't the only solution for representing exact numbers)

[12:22:44.0258] <sffc>
> so that e.g. new Decimal(amount) would work without any special Amount-detection code.
This is based on the potentially flawed premise that `new Decimal(amount)` would call ToString on the `amount`, but TC39 has ruled that we don't want this type of implicit conversion.

[12:22:49.0649] <sffc>

This is based on the potentially flawed premise that `new Decimal(amount)` would call ToString on the `amount`, but TC39 has ruled that we don't want this type of implicit conversion.

[12:27:42.0060] <sffc>
Besides that point, I don't find the `new Decimal(amount)` argument to be convincing because:

1. Brand checking is easy and ECMA does it all the time now, and even without brand checking, it could check for e.g. a `.decimal` field or a `Symbol.toDecimal` function
2. Amount can have a `toDecimal` function, which looks nicer in chaining (people like method chaining)

[02:41:25.0930] <Jesse>
perhaps on Thursday we can discuss this

[02:41:28.0143] <Jesse>

[09:04:01.0990] <Jesse>
eemeli: are you able to come?

[10:00:31.0366] <Jesse>
here are the items I have as next steps for us:

[10:00:47.0544] <Jesse>
* Prepare slides for Measure for stage 2
* Allow “1.2[kg]” in the constructor (currently not allowed)
* Change Intl.NmberFormat to accept merely style: unit/currently without throwing.
* Add toNumber to spec text
* ToPrimitive: should give number or string if no currency/unit, throw otherwise.
* RGN updates us about concerns re: currency in the chat or as an issue


[10:02:25.0606] <Jesse>
* - Prepare slides for Amount for stage 2
- Allow “1.2\[kg\]” in the constructor (currently not allowed)
- Change Intl.NmberFormat to accept merely style: unit/currently without throwing.
- Add toNumber to spec text for Amount
- ToPrimitive: should give number or string if no currency/unit, throw otherwise.
- RGN updates us about concerns re: currency in the chat or as an issue

[11:01:37.0239] <eemeli>
Supporting “1.2[kg]” in the constructor would presumably let `new Amount(a)` "just work", where `a` is itself an Amount.


2025-07-15
[04:24:47.0381] <eemeli>
The draft spec for keep-trailing-zeros is now available: https://tc39.es/proposal-intl-keep-trailing-zeros

Richard Gibson's script was really useful in generating that from https://github.com/eemeli/ecma402/pull/1, which I'll continue to keep open & in sync with the proposal repo's version.

I've submitted this for stage 2/2.7 advancement at the upcoming TC39 meeting, and am currently working on slides for it.


2025-07-16
[11:00:13.0188] <sffc>
eemeli: For the Mixed Units proposal, Ben's README has examples like
```
    let footAndInch = new Measurement(5.5, {unit: "foot-and-inch"})
    footAndInch.toComponents()
    // [ {value: 5, unit: "foot"}, {value: 6, unit: "inch"}]
    footAndInch.toString()
    // "5 feet and 6 inches"
```
This requires unit conversion. Did you have in mind a way to implement mixed unit formatting without that?

[11:00:59.0675] <sffc>
Note: We already support ListFormat with type="unit", and you can glue together your own mixed unit format string if you have the individual values.

[11:26:55.0830] <eemeli>
One possibility, based on DurationFormat:
```
let nf = new Intl.NumberFormat('en', { style: 'unit', unit: 'foot-and-inch' })
nf.format({ foot: 5, inch: 6 })
```

[13:21:05.0364] <sffc>
I don't know if I want to open the can of worms of Intl.NumberFormat.prototype.format accepting a bag of fields

[13:21:42.0410] <sffc>
How do you feel about saying that mixed units will be shifted into the Smart Units proposal instead of their own proposal?

[13:54:58.0643] <eemeli>
I don't really see how they're connected, except as both advancing unit formatting? If that's enough, then maybe it makes sense to roll them up into one.

[14:58:01.0042] <sffc>
I mean, I'm not personally convinced that mixed unit formatting carries its own weight without the conversion half of the feature, since you can already get it manually by using a ListFormat to glue pieces together.

[15:13:51.0680] <eemeli>
That's fair. I'm not too invested in mixed units myself, so have no strong opinions here.


2025-07-17
[03:51:25.0956] <eemeli>
I validated the keep-trailing-zeros spec changes by applying them to the Format.js Intl.NumberFormat polyfill, here: https://github.com/eemeli/formatjs

The changes appear to work exactly as intended. It uses `decimal.js` internally to represent intl mathematical values, so I put the [[StringDigits]] as a new property on it, rather than adding a wrapping object.

[01:54:36.0866] <sffc>
At least 3 programming languages have an Amount-like thing in the standard library: Swift, Java, and F#. Several others have it in popular packages. Seems worth highlighting.

[01:54:54.0632] <Jesse>
thanks for putting that together

[01:55:06.0030] <Jesse>
I can add a slide for this

[01:56:37.0749] <sffc>
`Quantity` seems to be the most popular name for it, except in Swift which uses the name `Measurement`. No one I saw uses `Amount`. That doesn't mean it's a bad name, it just means there is less precedent for it

[01:57:18.0901] <Jesse>
IIRC we  also floated "quantity" a while back but didn't pick it

[01:58:20.0618] <sffc>
We can do a TG5 study at Stage 2 like we did with Temporal to decide between PlainDate, LocalDate, and CivilDate

[02:01:09.0864] <sffc>
Also, the "Why Amount" slide should have a bullet point about library interop: introducing a standard data type that third-party libraries can use interoperably

[02:01:58.0533] <sffc>
For example, a third-party unit conversion library and a third-party widget can talk natively with each other with Amount

[02:02:08.0712] <sffc>
* For example, a third-party unit conversion library and a third-party unit picker widget can talk natively with each other with Amount

[02:02:55.0479] <sffc>
(and of course they can also talk natively with Intl.NumberFormat)

[02:03:36.0771] <sffc>
Amount does this better than a protocol because it is immutable with its own prototype and methods for interacting with it

[02:31:33.0711] <sffc>
If anyone in plenary wants to push on the protocol thing… there's another topic on the agenda about why Thenables, TC39's most prominent procol, are a security risk due to prototype inheritance. Immutable objects with a specific API are safer.

[05:03:47.0935] <eemeli>
This seems like information that ought to be included in the readme, no?

[05:04:15.0181] <Jesse>
agree -- I can add that

[05:05:15.0115] <eemeli>
I would prefer not opening up the naming discussion again. It's a possibility, yes, but I don't think we should be actively pushing for more bikeshedding.

[05:07:28.0331] <Jesse>
my recollection is that we've largely settled on a name -- I think with "amount" we've been in a steady state for a while now

[05:07:42.0265] <Jesse>
(though indeed maybe a better name could come up)
