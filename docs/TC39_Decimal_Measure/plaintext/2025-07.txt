Unfortunately I'll not be able to join the meeting today (due to some rain that happened a few days ago causing significant travel disruptions ðŸ˜…)

I'll be there. Should be able to share a draft of the spec changes for keep-trailing-zeros that I've been working on.

Said spec draft: https://github.com/eemeli/ecma402/pull/1

I found it easier to start on the diff by working on a branch of the whole `ecma402` repo; is there any ecmarkup tooling that could take a git diff and generate the usual sort of proposal spec presentation from that?

* Said spec draft: https://github.com/eemeli/ecma402/pull/1

I found it easier to start on the diff by working on a fork of the whole `ecma402` repo; is there any ecmarkup tooling that could take a git diff and generate the usual sort of proposal spec presentation from that?
