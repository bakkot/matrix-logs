Unfortunately I'll not be able to join the meeting today (due to some rain that happened a few days ago causing significant travel disruptions ðŸ˜…)

I'll be there. Should be able to share a draft of the spec changes for keep-trailing-zeros that I've been working on.

[05:39:23.0143] <eemeli>
Said spec draft: https://github.com/eemeli/ecma402/pull/1

I found it easier to start on the diff by working on a branch of the whole `ecma402` repo; is there any ecmarkup tooling that could take a git diff and generate the usual sort of proposal spec presentation from that?

I found it easier to start on the diff by working on a fork of the whole `ecma402` repo; is there any ecmarkup tooling that could take a git diff and generate the usual sort of proposal spec presentation from that?

well, it's trivial to just apply the diff and render the resulting specâ€”or did you have something else in mind, like translating `git diff --word-diff=plain` `[-removed-]`/`{+added+}` output into `<del>removed</del>`/`<ins>added</ins>`?

[05:50:56.0236] <eemeli>
Yes, to the latte question.

[05:50:59.0754] <eemeli>
* Yes, to the latter question.

I'll be there

Not having previously worked on a proposal that's more about changing existing text rather than adding new stuff, I figured I'd ask as I presume this type of thing happens on occasion.

I've also got a PR for reducing the scope of measure in line with our earlier discussions: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-measure/pull/29

[07:51:41.0710] <eemeli>
Jesse: Added some comments on your PR.

[07:57:17.0785] <eemeli>
Jesse: In https://github.com/tc39/proposal-measure/pull/29 you're proposing that we drop units and currencies from the initial Amount? That seems surprisingly different from what we've been discussing so far.
