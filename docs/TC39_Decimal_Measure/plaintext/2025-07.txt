Unfortunately I'll not be able to join the meeting today (due to some rain that happened a few days ago causing significant travel disruptions 😅)

I'll be there. Should be able to share a draft of the spec changes for keep-trailing-zeros that I've been working on.

[05:39:23.0143] <eemeli>
Said spec draft: https://github.com/eemeli/ecma402/pull/1

I found it easier to start on the diff by working on a branch of the whole `ecma402` repo; is there any ecmarkup tooling that could take a git diff and generate the usual sort of proposal spec presentation from that?

I found it easier to start on the diff by working on a fork of the whole `ecma402` repo; is there any ecmarkup tooling that could take a git diff and generate the usual sort of proposal spec presentation from that?

well, it's trivial to just apply the diff and render the resulting spec—or did you have something else in mind, like translating `git diff --word-diff=plain` `[-removed-]`/`{+added+}` output into `<del>removed</del>`/`<ins>added</ins>`?

[05:50:56.0236] <eemeli>
Yes, to the latte question.

[05:50:59.0754] <eemeli>
* Yes, to the latter question.

[05:52:09.0926] <Jesse>
I'll be there

[05:52:15.0642] <eemeli>
Not having previously worked on a proposal that's more about changing existing text rather than adding new stuff, I figured I'd ask as I presume this type of thing happens on occasion.

[06:18:21.0415] <Jesse>
I've also got a PR for reducing the scope of measure in line with our earlier discussions: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-measure/pull/29

[07:51:41.0710] <eemeli>
Jesse: Added some comments on your PR.

[07:57:17.0785] <eemeli>
Jesse: In https://github.com/tc39/proposal-measure/pull/29 you're proposing that we drop units and currencies from the initial Amount? That seems surprisingly different from what we've been discussing so far.

[08:20:57.0738] <Jesse>
ah, right -- taking a look at the old notes, I realize I cut too much

[08:21:05.0965] <Jesse>
I'll restore units + currency

[08:21:07.0426] <Jesse>
sorry about that

[08:21:12.0838] <Jesse>
I'll restore units + currency

[08:22:25.0657] <Jesse>
in the spec text we do support units + currency, so the README and spec are out-of-sync
