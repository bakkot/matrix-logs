If we do have a call this week, I would like to present a new proposal, which I intend to also present to TG2 for approval to present to TG1 at the upcoming meeting:

https://github.com/eemeli/proposal-intl-keep-trailing-zeros

The very short description of the proposal is to make it so that this happens:

    const nf = new Intl.NumberFormat("en");
    nf.format("1.0") === "1.0";

    const pr = new Intl.PluralRules("en");
    pr.select("1.0") === "other";

This is a follow-up to discussions at the last tc39-numerics call.

[04:20:34.0953] <eemeli>
I would also welcome co-champions for the proposal.

[04:32:41.0756] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'd love to talk about it. It seems like this week the numerics call is right before the TG2 one, maybe we can coalesce them?

[04:55:42.0592] <eemeli>
The TG2 agenda looks pretty full this week. My preference would be to aim for a max 45 min numerics call at its planned timeslot, and to talk about this separately at both meetings as the audiences and viewpoints are distinct.

[05:08:28.0938] <Jesse>
sgtm

[10:16:42.0298] <sffc>
I don't feel "proposal-intl-keep-trailing-zeros" is particularly controversial on its own. It's basically a bugfix.

[05:39:19.0734] <Jesse>
call in 3.5 hours!

[06:45:53.0157] <eemeli>
At least for me, neither the browser or Android versions of Element appear to support markdown links in the topic, so they're showing up as syntax.

[06:46:23.0854] <eemeli>
But with the `https://` parts thankfully linkified.

[07:52:39.0919] <Jesse>
oh, sorry about that -- it works for me

[07:52:49.0334] <Jesse>
I can unmarkdown things

[09:02:22.0375] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Meeting time!

[09:53:05.0649] <sffc>
ICU4X meeting conflict today, sorry. I'll be in the TG2 meeting though!

Possibly interesting/relevant from a "tc39-numerics" PoV, I happened to notice that jschoi has submitted https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint-math/ for Stage 2 advancement at the upcoming meeting.

[04:06:27.0189] <Jesse>
absolutely, I've been following this privately but we can definitely talk about these ideas together

[04:06:29.0315] <Jesse>
thanks!

[08:44:20.0642] <jschoi>
> <@jesse:igalia.com> absolutely, I've been following this privately but we can definitely talk about these ideas together

If you or eemeli have any feedback, concerns, or coordination regarding BigInt Math and its interaction with other numerics proposals, let me know. I‚Äôll be making my presentations soon.

When are people getting to A Coru√±a? We should have a numerics mini summit


2025-05-17
[02:45:51.0804] <eemeli>
I'm arriving rather late on Tuesday night, but staying on for the Web Engines Hackfest.


2025-05-19
[23:32:53.0352] <Jesse>
I'll be there on the 27th!

[04:12:24.0624] <sffc>
Ok, maybe those of us who are there on Tuesday can get dinner, and then there should be enough time later in the week and weekend to pull others in


2025-05-20
[00:38:21.0620] <Jesse>
and in anticipation of that, we have the biweekly JS numerics call this Thursday!


2025-05-22
[05:42:30.0060] <Jesse>
it looks like I have some unexpected childcare duty today; I'm afraid I can't meet with y'all as planned

[05:42:45.0640] <Jesse>
you're welcome to meet; if you do, please do add any interesting items here

[05:43:14.0868] <Jesse>
a number of us will be in A Coru√±a next week, so I'm looking forward to working with y'all face-to-face soon

[00:49:12.0559] <Jesse (üá™üá∏)>
numerics fans! Shall we do a minisummit while we're here? One idea would be to meet tomorrow after plenary

[00:49:32.0457] <Jesse (üá™üá∏)>
AFAIK a number of us are also here next week for the Web Engines Hackfest

[01:13:23.0967] <nicolo-ribaudo>
eemeli Time to get the fractionalDigits vs fractionDigits bikeshedding on the agenda!

[01:14:17.0067] <sffc>
There isn't much extra time this week, but I want us to reserve a nice chunk of time for this. I would be open to a nice Saturday walk to Fisterra with JS Numerics on the agenda.

[01:15:55.0576] <eemeli>
The community event is tomorrow an hour after the meeting ends, and AFAIK ryzokuken and I are due to talk about MF2 there.

[01:16:33.0521] <ryzokuken>
yep the community event starts 18:30 tomorrow 

[01:16:48.0341] <Jesse (üá™üá∏)>
Friday could also work? at the moment Friday seems to be kind of empty

[01:17:28.0711] <sffc>
I already have Friday booked for time with the Igalia Intl team about Intl Era Month Code, etc.

[01:18:56.0724] <eemeli>
Could do a numerics dinner tomorrow after the community event?

[01:35:28.0865] <Jesse (üá™üá∏)>
that might be getting a bit late but I'm open to it
