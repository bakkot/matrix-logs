If we do have a call this week, I would like to present a new proposal, which I intend to also present to TG2 for approval to present to TG1 at the upcoming meeting:

https://github.com/eemeli/proposal-intl-keep-trailing-zeros

The very short description of the proposal is to make it so that this happens:

    const nf = new Intl.NumberFormat("en");
    nf.format("1.0") === "1.0";

    const pr = new Intl.PluralRules("en");
    pr.select("1.0") === "other";

This is a follow-up to discussions at the last tc39-numerics call.

[04:20:34.0953] <eemeli>
I would also welcome co-champions for the proposal.

I'd love to talk about it. It seems like this week the numerics call is right before the TG2 one, maybe we can coalesce them?

[04:55:42.0592] <eemeli>
The TG2 agenda looks pretty full this week. My preference would be to aim for a max 45 min numerics call at its planned timeslot, and to talk about this separately at both meetings as the audiences and viewpoints are distinct.

sgtm

I don't feel "proposal-intl-keep-trailing-zeros" is particularly controversial on its own. It's basically a bugfix.

call in 3.5 hours!

[06:45:53.0157] <eemeli>
At least for me, neither the browser or Android versions of Element appear to support markdown links in the topic, so they're showing up as syntax.

[06:46:23.0854] <eemeli>
But with the `https://` parts thankfully linkified.

[07:52:39.0919] <Jesse>
oh, sorry about that -- it works for me

[07:52:49.0334] <Jesse>
I can unmarkdown things

[09:02:22.0375] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Meeting time!

[09:53:05.0649] <sffc>
ICU4X meeting conflict today, sorry. I'll be in the TG2 meeting though!

Possibly interesting/relevant from a "tc39-numerics" PoV, I happened to notice that jschoi has submitted https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint-math/ for Stage 2 advancement at the upcoming meeting.

[04:06:27.0189] <Jesse>
absolutely, I've been following this privately but we can definitely talk about these ideas together

[04:06:29.0315] <Jesse>
thanks!

> <@jesse:igalia.com> absolutely, I've been following this privately but we can definitely talk about these ideas together

If you or eemeli have any feedback, concerns, or coordination regarding BigInt Math and its interaction with other numerics proposals, let me know. I’ll be making my presentations soon.

When are people getting to A Coruña? We should have a numerics mini summit

I'm arriving rather late on Tuesday night, but staying on for the Web Engines Hackfest.
