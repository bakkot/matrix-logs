after recovering over the weekend from lots of productive JS numerics conversations, here's my understanding of the current plan:

* for July plenary: spec text and tests for proposal-intl-keep-trailing-zeros, going to stage 2 or even 2.7
* measure proposal renamed to "amount", scope gets reduced, data model changes from decimals to digit strings
* for July plenary: amount proposal for stage 2
* amount removed from decimal proposal (because that functionality moves to proposal-amount), spec text polished and completed
* for July plenary: no decimal update, no stage advancement
* for September plenary: ask for stage 2 for decimal
* smart units remains on the radar and up for discussion, though currently lacks a plan and schedule

how does that look?
