after recovering over the weekend from lots of productive JS numerics conversations, here's my understanding of the current plan:

* for July plenary: spec text and tests for proposal-intl-keep-trailing-zeros, going to stage 2 or even 2.7
* measure proposal renamed to "amount", scope gets reduced, data model changes from decimals to digit strings
* for July plenary: amount proposal for stage 2
* amount removed from decimal proposal (because that functionality moves to proposal-amount), spec text polished and completed
* for July plenary: no decimal update, no stage advancement
* for September plenary: ask for stage 2 for decimal
* smart units remains on the radar and up for discussion, though currently lacks a plan and schedule

how does that look?

Don't remove Decimal.Amount until we have seen if standalone Amount actually gets Stage 2

[06:38:00.0424] <sffc>
In September plenary, we send Decimal for Stage 2, either on its own (if Amount got Stage 2 in July) or paired with Decimal.Amount

The rest aligns with my expectations üëçÔ∏è

my concerns about advancing decimal remain unchanged. but the rest sgtm

[01:15:10.0155] <sffc>
Should I cancel the Numerics call this Thursday evening?

sgtm -- I think we're pretty much up-to-date at the moment
