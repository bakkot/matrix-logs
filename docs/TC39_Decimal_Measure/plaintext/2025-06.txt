after recovering over the weekend from lots of productive JS numerics conversations, here's my understanding of the current plan:

* for July plenary: spec text and tests for proposal-intl-keep-trailing-zeros, going to stage 2 or even 2.7
* measure proposal renamed to "amount", scope gets reduced, data model changes from decimals to digit strings
* for July plenary: amount proposal for stage 2
* amount removed from decimal proposal (because that functionality moves to proposal-amount), spec text polished and completed
* for July plenary: no decimal update, no stage advancement
* for September plenary: ask for stage 2 for decimal
* smart units remains on the radar and up for discussion, though currently lacks a plan and schedule

how does that look?

Don't remove Decimal.Amount until we have seen if standalone Amount actually gets Stage 2

[06:38:00.0424] <sffc>
In September plenary, we send Decimal for Stage 2, either on its own (if Amount got Stage 2 in July) or paired with Decimal.Amount

The rest aligns with my expectations 👍️

my concerns about advancing decimal remain unchanged. but the rest sgtm

[01:15:10.0155] <sffc>
Should I cancel the Numerics call this Thursday evening?

[01:23:02.0962] <Jesse>
sgtm -- I think we're pretty much up-to-date at the moment

[01:29:38.0259] <sffc>
Only thing is if we wanted to sync with Jordan?

[01:31:40.0548] <Jesse>
ljharb: would you be able to attend the call this week?

[01:33:09.0571] <Jesse>
if not that's ok, but it would be great if you could join the call sometime in the near future

[01:33:33.0401] <Jesse>
it's biweekly
