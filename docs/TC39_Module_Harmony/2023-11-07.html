It seems clear that it would not be possible for the host module hook to create more than one instance per url in this scheme. That would make it equivalent in utility to any HTML system where a Worker can be instantiated with a configured resolution behavior (like transferring the import map) and importing by URL specifier.</td></tr>

I'm not at all confident in my comment the other day. I think my idea won't help here (which was sharing the import graph by passing it, otherwise falling back on the behavior that would be implemented by modulesource). I think there are other restrictions that would make that unacceptable. From a browser perspective, we don't allow multi-instantiating within the same loader. The spec allows it, but all browsers cache (and the spec is being updated to reflect this. I would need to understand a few concrete usecases for this. On the other hand, i can see a usecase for multi-instantiation with module unloading, one frustration we have is the inability to garbage collect a module after instantiation (after which point it is no longer used). We have an api for that internally. Regarding the shared module map: I can see this as making things more memory efficient and allowing us to just pull the sources that we need, in the configuration that we need, and re-run them. However, passing that between different contexts with dynamic import seems like it could be very complex and open up possibilities I haven't thought about. I think the most restricted case is the safest.  We could also introduce a distinction between the dynamic import links and the static ones, and allow sharing of only static links, meaning that dynamic import links would reconstruct, or would point to a sub-tree that is all static and preloaded. but like i said -- this seems verrrry complex</td></tr>
