Anyone joining the call today?

Chengzhong Wu: I don't think I can join today

We had a short discussion about Node.js's require ESM PR, called the meeting early.

Next week, we will be discussing the proposal sketch for ESM source again, so hopefully more folks can make that one.

Is the new time with daylight savings causing issues for anyone? I believe we will catch up to Europe at the end of March.

Yeah these three weeks have mismatched timezones

[08:32:20.0963] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I can try to be free next week (not 100% sure), and I will be free for sure the week after

okay thanks for trying to make it work next week that would be a great help. It might be easier to try make things work than to bump the meeting time just for these three weeks.

If there is an issue with the timing though we could make an exception for next week only and say we'll meet an hour later just for that one.
