I'll be a bit later today due to an overlapping WinterCG meeting.

Anyone joining the call today?

Chengzhong Wu: I don't think I can join today

We had a short discussion about Node.js's require ESM PR, called the meeting early.

Next week, we will be discussing the proposal sketch for ESM source again, so hopefully more folks can make that one.

Is the new time with daylight savings causing issues for anyone? I believe we will catch up to Europe at the end of March.

[08:31:45.0417] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Yeah these three weeks have mismatched timezones

[08:32:20.0963] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I can try to be free next week (not 100% sure), and I will be free for sure the week after

[08:35:45.0038] <guybedford>
okay thanks for trying to make it work next week that would be a great help. It might be easier to try make things work than to bump the meeting time just for these three weeks.

If there is an issue with the timing though we could make an exception for next week only and say we'll meet an hour later just for that one.

Ok so, unfortunately this week I cannot be free at the NorthAmerica-based time for the meeting. I am free the our after (i.e. the usual time for us in Europe) though.

[08:42:38.0970] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Next week I'm free in both timeslots

[08:42:45.0510] <nicolo-ribaudo>
And the week after we are aligned again

[09:16:30.0737] <guybedford>
Ok, then I propose we shift the meeting this week only forward by an hour to help us move forward here. Unless anyone who would like to attend to discuss the ESM source phase design has any issues with making that time this week?

[09:34:30.0851] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Btw I also have an update about defer imports :)

hi nicolo-ribaudo I see you recently have commits on your webpack defer import implementation. Is there any significant change? I want to pick up my PR but I want to make sure I'm not redoing the work.

[01:15:14.0743] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Hi! Since I didn't get any answer from you, I went ahead and opened https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/18139 after fixing CI in your PR, now waiting for reviews.

I waited a wail but then assumed you had just abandoned the PR ðŸ˜…

does it include the new `export defer` or `export optional`?

[05:39:38.0284] <nicolo-ribaudo>
No, only the import part

Next week, Bloomberg is hosting a Node Collaborator Summit in our office in London. This is a hybrid meeting, fully open to remote participation. We plan to have a session to discuss modules, and it would be great if people from this group want to join in too. Find more information at https://github.com/openjs-foundation/summit/issues/397 . The exact date and time is not yet determined; let me know about your schedule constraints if you want to attend.

[15:37:42.0392] <kriskowal>
If it happens to overlap Pacific 10:00â€“5:00, Iâ€™ll (probably) be able to participate.
