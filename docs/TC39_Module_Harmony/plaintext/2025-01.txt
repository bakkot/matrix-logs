As discussed last year, here is finally a poll if we want to pick a different timeslot. Doodle only let me select 10 possible options, so I went with this other website instead: https://tallycal.com/p/1479200-1/

[07:54:47.0235] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Do we want to meet today at the old time?

[07:57:01.0568] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I _think_ it will use your local timezone, but be careful just in case it's using mine

> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> I _think_ it will use your local timezone, but be careful just in case it's using mine

It appears to have detected mine (it cites "Amsterdam")

Oh, actually it explicitly says it's localised it for me

[08:01:55.0747] <guybedford>
I put a couple of items on the agenda if folks want to discuss

I'm flying to Cape Town, so I can't make today's meeting (nor next week's)

Sorry for the late notice ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[07:32:24.0473] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I unfortunately also cannot join today. Please remember y'all to fill the poll for the time slot

[08:05:31.0856] <guybedford>
Ok let's cancel for today and pick up next week, hopefully with some poll data to discuss times going forward as well

[08:06:12.0834] <guybedford>
Enjoy, make sure to visit boulders beach! How long are you there for?

XS implementation notes on ESM source phase imports https://gist.github.com/phoddie/8c99df5a6fbf2173973e6426dc3ff2fd

[10:05:21.0106] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh thanks for sharing!

[10:06:33.0754] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm surprised by that `a0Source !== a1Source: true` in the first example 

[10:09:24.0180] <guybedford>
Agreed with Nicolo here, the spec should require equality here

Topics for today are from nicolo-ribaudo and Jesse Alma if either are available to address their topics.

[10:05:14.0945] <kriskowal>
I believe we‚Äôve run the ESM source phase imports topic to a fitting conclusion (with guybedford)

[10:10:02.0060] <guybedford>
kriskowal: thanks for the ping, we are still waiting to get the final sign off on the stage progression from the meeting though. Maybe we can just get a formal all okay for progression.

[10:14:10.0662] <kriskowal>
No sign of MarkM yet today but I‚Äôll remind him that you‚Äôre pending.

[10:14:51.0802] <kriskowal>
Do you have an issue he can comment on that would be a suitable place to make his formal will known?

[10:15:03.0071] <kriskowal>
I‚Äôll just drop that in his inbox, if so.

[10:20:39.0364] <guybedford>
Sure, we have https://github.com/tc39/proposal-esm-phase-imports/issues/46, and I just posted an update on that issue
