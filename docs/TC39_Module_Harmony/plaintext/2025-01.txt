As discussed last year, here is finally a poll if we want to pick a different timeslot. Doodle only let me select 10 possible options, so I went with this other website instead: https://tallycal.com/p/1479200-1/

Do we want to meet today at the old time?

I _think_ it will use your local timezone, but be careful just in case it's using mine

It appears to have detected mine (it cites "Amsterdam")
