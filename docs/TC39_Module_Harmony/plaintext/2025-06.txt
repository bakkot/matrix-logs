Any items on the agenda for today?

[08:07:26.0486] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I unfortunately cannot join this week, sorry for not giving advance notice

[08:07:48.0832] <guybedford>
Went ahead and cancelled for today.

The suggested new meeting time is for a Wednesday slot one hour later, and I believe that works for Kris Kowal and Richard Gibson. nicolo-ribaudo Jacob Smith Chengzhong Wu please do share if that time can work for you, and we can look at getting the meeting updated.

[08:21:03.0630] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Uhm didn't we talk about Monday?

[08:21:33.0815] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Because Wed was conflicting with TG4

[08:21:41.0885] <guybedford>
Yes Wednesday or Monday, Kris Kowal said Monday wasn't doable but Wednesday was

[11:13:40.0194] <kriskowal>
Indeed, Wednesday before TG3 is feasible for me most weeks. Indeed, Monday in times overlapping Europe is infeasible for me most weeks.

[16:02:38.0177] <Chengzhong Wu>
Wednesday does not work for me. Monday with the current time works though. Monday slot one hour later does not.

Well, there’s nothing for it, I guess. Wizard staves, dawn, ten paces, to the nap.

[17:54:29.0167] <kriskowal>
And I’ll have you know, I put Doug Crockford to sleep in ten minutes once. Also, Dan Kaminsky.

[17:54:49.0929] <kriskowal>
Or we could do a Doodle again with more times.

[17:55:05.0417] <kriskowal>
Or alternate weeks.

[21:07:48.0916] <guybedford>
what could work for you on alternate weeks kriskowal ?

[21:08:26.0930] <guybedford>
let's sync on times again one more time and see if we can make progress

[21:09:00.0859] <guybedford>
otherwise yes, we may not have another good option here

[02:19:15.0172] <Aapo Alasuutari>
Regarding the LoadModule hook and FinishModuleLoading AO: is the embedder allowed to change the referrer and moduleRequest parameters between the two? Does that make sense in some remote case?

[02:40:03.0318] <nicolo-ribaudo>
The spec doesn't explicitly forbid it, but it's not an intended use case

[12:25:45.0826] <guybedford>
Just to confirm - the meeting will be at the same time as usual tomorrow. I'd like to also add an item to discuss the WebAssembly ESM Integration builtins and import attribute story per https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration/pull/95 and https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration/issues/99.

[12:28:26.0979] <kriskowal>
I mean that if every other week, the meeting were held at a time I could attend (e.g., the same time and one hour later, alternating), that could break the impasse. I’d feel obliged to help write summaries that kept the other half of the room up-to-speed.

[12:29:20.0332] <guybedford>
Which other week would work for that? This week or next?

[12:30:31.0570] <kriskowal>
I do not wish to disrupt your cadence. If that alternation began next week, I could probably attend. If an hour later yet, guarantee I can attend.

[12:33:44.0157] <guybedford>
so unfortuantely one hour later on a thursday in the cadence that starts tomorrow I can do, but in the cadence that starts from next week I have a conflict

[12:34:25.0536] <guybedford>
we could also move to biweekly on the current schedule and time without bumping an hour later

[12:34:51.0642] <guybedford>
we could certainly consider moving to that from next week too
