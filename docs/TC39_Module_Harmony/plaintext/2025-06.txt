I unfortunately cannot join this week, sorry for not giving advance notice

Went ahead and cancelled for today.

The suggested new meeting time is for a Wednesday slot one hour later, and I believe that works for Kris Kowal and Richard Gibson. nicolo-ribaudo Jacob Smith Chengzhong Wu please do share if that time can work for you, and we can look at getting the meeting updated.
