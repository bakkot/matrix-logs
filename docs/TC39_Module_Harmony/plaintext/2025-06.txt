Any items on the agenda for today?

[08:07:26.0486] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I unfortunately cannot join this week, sorry for not giving advance notice

[08:07:48.0832] <guybedford>
Went ahead and cancelled for today.

The suggested new meeting time is for a Wednesday slot one hour later, and I believe that works for Kris Kowal and Richard Gibson. nicolo-ribaudo Jacob Smith Chengzhong Wu please do share if that time can work for you, and we can look at getting the meeting updated.

[08:21:03.0630] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Uhm didn't we talk about Monday?

[08:21:33.0815] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Because Wed was conflicting with TG4

[08:21:41.0885] <guybedford>
Yes Wednesday or Monday, Kris Kowal said Monday wasn't doable but Wednesday was

[11:13:40.0194] <kriskowal>
Indeed, Wednesday before TG3 is feasible for me most weeks. Indeed, Monday in times overlapping Europe is infeasible for me most weeks.

[16:02:38.0177] <Chengzhong Wu>
Wednesday does not work for me. Monday with the current time works though. Monday slot one hour later does not.

Well, there’s nothing for it, I guess. Wizard staves, dawn, ten paces, to the nap.

[17:54:29.0167] <kriskowal>
And I’ll have you know, I put Doug Crockford to sleep in ten minutes once. Also, Dan Kaminsky.

[17:54:49.0929] <kriskowal>
Or we could do a Doodle again with more times.

[17:55:05.0417] <kriskowal>
Or alternate weeks.

[21:07:48.0916] <guybedford>
what could work for you on alternate weeks kriskowal ?

[21:08:26.0930] <guybedford>
let's sync on times again one more time and see if we can make progress

[21:09:00.0859] <guybedford>
otherwise yes, we may not have another good option here

Regarding the LoadModule hook and FinishModuleLoading AO: is the embedder allowed to change the referrer and moduleRequest parameters between the two? Does that make sense in some remote case?
