Food for thought for folks in this room. For ModuleSource instances, XS reflected bindings with a `bindings` array and the mood in the room currently favors `import()`, `exports()`, and `reexports()` methods that return arrays of import specifiers, names, and import specifiers respectively. A virtual module source would be obliged to provide one or the other, but the XS `bindings` reflects a detail that is probably important. The evaluation of a virtual module source needs to get a namespace object that reflects the _internal_ names for all the bindings, like `import {x as y} from 'z'` would have `y` on the external namespace, and the `x` property on the internal namespace. This allows for `import {x as y} from 'a'; import {x as z} from 'b'`. This is a detail that the `imports()`, `exports()`, and `reexports()` expression of bindings can’t express.

guybedford: were you imagining that `source.imports()` return through to WebAssembly.Module.imports(source)` without mapping the {module, name, kind} treble to just name?

I would invite folks to join TG3 tomorrow to discuss module harmony topics. I don’t think we have an agenda.
