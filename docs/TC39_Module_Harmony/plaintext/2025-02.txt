We have topics from jesse (sick) and nicolo-ribaudo on our agenda backlog, and of course markm’s feedback pending for guybedford but no known controversy to discuss. Anything else for this week’s agenda?

[09:44:52.0368] <kriskowal>
Oh, wrong room. Please disregard or meet me in TG3.

I can't make the meeting today (i'll be on the tube from Richmond to London)

[12:31:25.0247] <Rob Palmer>
I hope you all know it is technically illegal to visit London and not stop by the Bloomberg building to say hi. Please remember this for next time.

Did we pick a new time yet?

[07:58:35.0764] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Nope, we only had three votes 😅

[07:58:48.0302] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Are we going to meet today? The agenda is empty

[08:00:54.0433] <nicolo-ribaudo>
If not, I'm going to use this hour to get the JSON modules PR in a mergeable state (it had a review 3 weeks ago)

[08:01:53.0705] <jakobjingleheimer>
I'm in bisect land 😶‍🌫️

[08:04:46.0167] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ok it was just me, Richard, and Chengzhong and we ended up cancelling

[08:04:56.0452] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Next week is also cancelled, due to the TC39 meeting :)

Are we meeting at the old time today?

[08:02:06.0162] <Chengzhong Wu>
i'm the only one if the call atm

[08:02:49.0990] <Chengzhong Wu>
Guy joined

[08:03:01.0788] <guybedford>
Still at the same time for now

[08:14:00.0545] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Apologies, I had some last-minute problems and cannot join

[08:14:17.0112] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Regarding the new time -- the poll has very few votes, and no time slot would have more attendance that what we currently have in our meeting unfortunately

[08:18:59.0072] <jakobjingleheimer>
Ah damn sorry. Making dinner now (have another meeting soon after this one)

[08:50:46.0899] <guybedford>
Here's the notes from the Wasm CG RTT discussion yesterday that I mentioned for those interested - https://github.com/WebAssembly/meetings/pull/1765

One option might be to simply bump the current meeting back one hour to avoid the WinterTC clash finally
