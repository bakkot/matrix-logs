I can't make the meeting today (i'll be on the tube from Richmond to London)

[12:31:25.0247] <Rob Palmer>
I hope you all know it is technically illegal to visit London and not stop by the Bloomberg building to say hi. Please remember this for next time.

Did we pick a new time yet?

[07:58:35.0764] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Nope, we only had three votes üòÖ

[07:58:48.0302] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Are we going to meet today? The agenda is empty

[08:00:54.0433] <nicolo-ribaudo>
If not, I'm going to use this hour to get the JSON modules PR in a mergeable state (it had a review 3 weeks ago)

[08:01:53.0705] <jakobjingleheimer>
I'm in bisect land üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

[08:04:46.0167] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ok it was just me, Richard, and Chengzhong and we ended up cancelling

[08:04:56.0452] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Next week is also cancelled, due to the TC39 meeting :)

i'm the only one if the call atm

[08:02:49.0990] <Chengzhong Wu>
Guy joined

[08:03:01.0788] <guybedford>
Still at the same time for now

[08:14:00.0545] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Apologies, I had some last-minute problems and cannot join

[08:14:17.0112] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Regarding the new time -- the poll has very few votes, and no time slot would have more attendance that what we currently have in our meeting unfortunately

[08:18:59.0072] <jakobjingleheimer>
Ah damn sorry. Making dinner now (have another meeting soon after this one)
