I can't make the meeting today (i'll be on the tube from Richmond to London)

I hope you all know it is technically illegal to visit London and not stop by the Bloomberg building to say hi. Please remember this for next time.

Did we pick a new time yet?

[07:58:35.0764] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Nope, we only had three votes üòÖ

[07:58:48.0302] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Are we going to meet today? The agenda is empty

[08:00:54.0433] <nicolo-ribaudo>
If not, I'm going to use this hour to get the JSON modules PR in a mergeable state (it had a review 3 weeks ago)

[08:01:53.0705] <jakobjingleheimer>
I'm in bisect land üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

[08:04:46.0167] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ok it was just me, Richard, and Chengzhong and we ended up cancelling

[08:04:56.0452] <nicolo-ribaudo>
