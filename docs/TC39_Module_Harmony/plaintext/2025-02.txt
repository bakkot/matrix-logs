We have topics from jesse (sick) and nicolo-ribaudo on our agenda backlog, and of course markm’s feedback pending for guybedford but no known controversy to discuss. Anything else for this week’s agenda?

I hope you all know it is technically illegal to visit London and not stop by the Bloomberg building to say hi. Please remember this for next time.
