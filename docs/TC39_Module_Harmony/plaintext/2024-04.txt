Jack Works: I am down a rabbit hole. Not sure if you remember: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments/issues/11 Was your intention there to do a babel-like transform on a Javascript file?

At a high level do any of these proposals allow one to create an import "preprocessor" that hooks all imports (and their import attributes), modify their source text, and output a module? (And then hook any new imports if applicable in that module recursively). Or is that out of scope for the proposals?

That is certainly within scope for a `Module` instance constructor with an `importHook`.

Would this work for the "root" realm (not sure the term). Like in a node.js environment where an importHook could process everything? Or would you just create a ShadowRealm (or compartment?) and run the index file in a wrapper?
