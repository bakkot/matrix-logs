I've added an API musings gist for tomorrows agenda

[19:49:35.0361] <guybedford>
just throwing out a bunch of ideas for discussion, would be great to discuss thoughts then

[08:31:50.0248] <Kris Kowal>
I will not be able to attend today. 

[09:02:12.0050] <guybedford>
is anyone joining today?

[09:04:58.0730] <guybedford>
this is three meetings in a row no one has turned up

[09:05:11.0639] <guybedford>
if we are cancelling these meetings going forward please lets do it explicitly

[09:08:18.0122] <guybedford>
I understand many are still in Japan this week, but really do hope we can pick up from next - we have a bunch to do, and there are others interested in attending our meetings as well

[09:09:09.0969] <guybedford>
the first item next week should also be reconsidering the timeslot as mentioned

[17:27:14.0378] <nicolo-ribaudo>
You are right, sorry for not mentioning that I am on holidays next week — lets make sure to meet next week, to avoid stalling on this work

I'm not in Europe yet this week (I'll be back for the next meeting) — how do you all feel about meeting later this time, between 16:00 PT and 19:00 PT?

[17:28:15.0663] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@lucacasonato:matrix.org> Feedback from TC39 in Tokyo: we should alternate this meeting between time zones to accommodate delegates from APAC better 

We could then also consider making it permanent as part of a weekly rotation if we are doing something for this 

[17:29:02.0633] <nicolo-ribaudo>
My preference would be 17-18 or 18-19 PT, unless we have folks from the US east cost

[17:30:45.0158] <nicolo-ribaudo>
(hours written under the assumption that Tuesday 16:00 PT is Tuesday 23:00 UTC)

Thanks Kris Kowal for the very interesting discussion today

[11:25:09.0881] <guybedford>
In terms of finding a new meeting time that works for folks going forward, I've put together this poll:

[11:25:13.0525] <guybedford>
https://www.when2meet.com/?21818959-jccpU

[11:25:45.0659] <guybedford>
please all try and fill it out for the next meeting, and then we can hopefully agree on the new slot in our meeting next week

[13:29:18.0294] <guybedford>
(note the above is in Pacific timezone)

[13:31:14.0769] <Kris Kowal>
(I’ll be away for a company “off site” (there is no “site”; it’s a conference) next week at our regularly scheduled time slot.)

[20:26:30.0230] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Filled

[20:27:32.0738] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Btw, we should also consider having a 24-hours poll and rotating between 2/3 options, like other groups with people across three very different timezones do

I'm a couple minutes late

[10:29:50.0863] <guybedford>
As discussed in the meeting today, one time would be preferable, but we still haven't got ideal cross-over with Asia while we also have daylight savings time changes coming up in a couple of weeks.

I've created a new poll just for the best cross-over times, that also starts only after the daylight savings time changes and takes into account the timezones at that point.

We will be keeping the same meeting time for next week until we have agreed on the new time.

Please fill this out again when you can, thanks! - https://doodle.com/meeting/organize/id/eZWZvNJa

Thanks for doing this! I see a different time on Friday compared to the other days, is it intentional? (One hour later)

Sure, appreciated for checking - yes I only had availability at that time on Friday myself!

I won't make it today due to a conflict with splash

[10:11:02.0424] <guybedford>
With regards to the new meeting time - if you responded previously, please verify your responses again as unfortunately I ended up setting the wrong timezone on the poll when I created the times. [https://doodle.com/meeting/organize/id/eZWZvNJa](https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/eZWZvNJa)

it has been maybe 1yr I haven't touch module harmony stuff, I wonder what we're having now than 1yr before?

[09:56:12.0705] <Jack Works>
I watching the repo but no notable activity is going on, looks like most of the activities are in the meeting

[09:56:29.0147] <Kris Kowal>
import.source made it to stage 3.

[09:56:53.0389] <Kris Kowal>
