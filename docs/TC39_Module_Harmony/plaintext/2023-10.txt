I've added an API musings gist for tomorrows agenda

[19:49:35.0361] <guybedford>
just throwing out a bunch of ideas for discussion, would be great to discuss thoughts then

[08:31:50.0248] <Kris Kowal>
I will not be able to attend today. 

[09:02:12.0050] <guybedford>
is anyone joining today?

[09:04:58.0730] <guybedford>
this is three meetings in a row no one has turned up

[09:05:11.0639] <guybedford>
if we are cancelling these meetings going forward please lets do it explicitly

[09:08:18.0122] <guybedford>
I understand many are still in Japan this week, but really do hope we can pick up from next - we have a bunch to do, and there are others interested in attending our meetings as well

[09:09:09.0969] <guybedford>
the first item next week should also be reconsidering the timeslot as mentioned

You are right, sorry for not mentioning that I am on holidays next week — lets make sure to meet next week, to avoid stalling on this work

I'm not in Europe yet this week (I'll be back for the next meeting) — how do you all feel about meeting later this time, between 16:00 PT and 19:00 PT?

[17:28:15.0663] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@lucacasonato:matrix.org> Feedback from TC39 in Tokyo: we should alternate this meeting between time zones to accommodate delegates from APAC better 

We could then also consider making it permanent as part of a weekly rotation if we are doing something for this 

[17:29:02.0633] <nicolo-ribaudo>
My preference would be 17-18 or 18-19 PT, unless we have folks from the US east cost

[17:30:45.0158] <nicolo-ribaudo>
(hours written under the assumption that Tuesday 16:00 PT is Tuesday 23:00 UTC)

Thanks Kris Kowal for the very interesting discussion today

[11:25:09.0881] <guybedford>
In terms of finding a new meeting time that works for folks going forward, I've put together this poll:

https://www.when2meet.com/?21818959-jccpU

[11:25:45.0659] <guybedford>
please all try and fill it out for the next meeting, and then we can hopefully agree on the new slot in our meeting next week

[13:29:18.0294] <guybedford>
(note the above is in Pacific timezone)

[13:31:14.0769] <Kris Kowal>
(I’ll be away for a company “off site” (there is no “site”; it’s a conference) next week at our regularly scheduled time slot.)

[20:26:30.0230] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Filled

[20:27:32.0738] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Btw, we should also consider having a 24-hours poll and rotating between 2/3 options, like other groups with people across three very different timezones do

I'm a couple minutes late
