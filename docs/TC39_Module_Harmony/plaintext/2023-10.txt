[09:04:58.0730] <guybedford>

[09:05:11.0639] <guybedford>

I understand many are still in Japan this week, but really do hope we can pick up from next - we have a bunch to do, and there are others interested in attending our meetings as well

[09:09:09.0969] <guybedford>
the first item next week should also be reconsidering the timeslot as mentioned

You are right, sorry for not mentioning that I am on holidays next week â€” lets make sure to meet next week, to avoid stalling on this work
