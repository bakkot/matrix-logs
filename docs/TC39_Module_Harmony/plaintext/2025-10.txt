TLA bug in Firefox (and I think WebKit too, but WebKit has multiple TLA bugs that it's difficult to tell why this is failing): https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/firefox-async-evaluation-bug/

nice catch... yes a web platform test for monotonic evaluation counting seems like it would be beneficial

thanks for filing the bug :)

[11:29:45.0080] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Getting a minimal reproduction was fun!

[11:41:49.0498] <Chris de Almeida>
hmmm.... I am imagining potential security implications with this bug.... maybe needs an embargo?

Seems we have a few things to discuss in module harmony but all require Nicolo who's on vacation, so cancelling the meeting for today due to lack of attendees. See you all next time.

Seem's there's finally a Chromium CL to support module network failures to not be cached - https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7039725.

Wow. Programming is really hard.

It's not particularly related to imports, but any chance i could put this on out agenda to get y'all's thoughts?

https://github.com/tc39/proposal-inspector/pull/2

There may be some changes between now and then (I just sent it over to Ruben to review).

[16:41:01.0460] <kriskowal>
Throw a description on it and I’ll socialize. Consider running it by #tc39-tg3-security:matrix.org. Would be a good venue if you can make a meeting. We can put it on the agenda.

I see the security meeting is tomorrow, but i don't see a time.

Description: flesh out Inspector API and examples; includes return modes (true/false and 'deviation' metadata), and compare options (consider prototype, etc).

[00:29:20.0920] <nicolo-ribaudo>
19:00 to 20:00

[00:29:42.0245] <nicolo-ribaudo>
(and you can find the zoom link in the TC39 calendar)

* Will we be meeting today? I have a bit of a potential conflict, so I'm wondering if I need to get it moved or if there's actually no conflict

[03:56:22.0333] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'd like to meet

[08:44:19.0740] <kriskowal>
I should be ready on time. See you soon

[09:02:19.0317] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Meeting time!

[10:22:18.0443] <guybedford>
With regards to `(await import('./foo.js#a')) === (await import('./foo.js#b')))` - it turns out these are distinct URLs in the module registry after all. Can't believe I forgot about that one.

Will follow up now with regards to the import attributes and bundling questions.
