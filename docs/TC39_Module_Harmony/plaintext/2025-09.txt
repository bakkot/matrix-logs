Hey, I don't remember if I mentioned last time we met, but I was talking with joyee (who worked on the recent module changes in Node.js), and he'd be curious to talk about module hooks to see where we are and how that relates to the Node.js system. Zb Tenerowicz (ZTZ/naugtur) / kriskowal do you plan to attend one of our upcoming meetings? :)

Iâ€™ll try to attend tomorrow. ZB has been able to drop in regularly recently.

I'll try to join tomorrow, yes

seems there was a pretty critical oversight in the type css import spec - https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11629

hopefully it gets corrected soon!

[20:35:23.0303] <guybedford>
see you all tomorrow
