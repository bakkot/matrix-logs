Module harmony agenda is empty for tomorrow. Come one, come all, please scribble a topic in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CD5lIBZLl24XBWbQhokqBdt4Zl7wPAcFJKJrgePr9HU/edit#

[16:15:07.0090] <guybedford>
I won't be able to make the meeting tomorrow myself, but will be able to resume again next week

[16:41:36.0510] <littledan>
I will miss it too (due to the Igalia web engines hackfest, where Nic gave a great talk that you can see at https://www.youtube.com/live/_yFkay2pQBA )

Apparently the custom elements people are thinking of making an HTML syntax for overriding what a specifier resolves to, see “Declarative CSS Module Scripts” at https://eisenbergeffect.medium.com/web-components-2023-spring-update-60c7873adf98

[17:02:19.0769] <littledan>
This is another possible solution in the space that module declarations (and CSS nested stylesheets) are operating

[17:03:14.0009] <littledan>
I’m not sure if a follow-up issue was filed but I think we should try to stay in the loop here

[02:41:38.0494] <Luca Casonato>
Nico, Dan, and me won’t be able to attend todays meeting

Playing around with import attributes... https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/scoped-css-imports

I’ll keep the door open for a while but we certainly don’t have quorum.

nicolo-ribaudo: that's a really interesting example!

[13:58:25.0733] <guybedford>
have you shown it to some of the css folks?

[13:58:49.0011] <guybedford>
perhaps Lea Verou would be interested as well?

This video is not playing for me. Not sure whether there’s another video, or if this is just broken for me and not other. Other videos work.

Works for me

[10:53:29.0238] <Kris Kowal>
Sigh.
