Just a heads up I'll likely not make the meeting tomorrow, but will be back next week

[09:10:35.0407] <Kris Kowal>
We did not convene. See you next week.

I added this to the agenda document, since we have been thinking about this rule at least twice:

> ### Agenda Rules
> - If 30 minutes before the start of the meeting the agenda is empty, the meeting is automatically canceled.
>   - _Adding topics to the agenda has a very low bar: a few words and a presenter are enough!_

I do not have a topic and we have no agenda yet. 

[08:32:45.0575] <Kris Kowal>
I’ve marked down that we will not convene today. Make your time.

This would be a good time to add your topic to today’s agenda.

[08:34:11.0178] <Kris Kowal>
Agenda is empty. See you all next time!
