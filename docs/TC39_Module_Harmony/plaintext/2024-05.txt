I got it working enough to use from tsc, the public API, and run our test suite. https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/58419

No idea if CI passes, `gh act` was not playing nice locally so I could not check ðŸ™‚

(Hard no on a registry from me, fwiw.)

Whatâ€™s the key differentiator between `import weak` vs `import defer` or `import source`?

[18:54:36.0306] <Richard Gibson>
IIUC, `weak` indicates that a module (or presumably a related entity in the case of e.g. `source`) should be returned if already available but otherwise the barest of stubs should appear in its place. It's like an opportunistic ESM analog of old-school feature testing.
