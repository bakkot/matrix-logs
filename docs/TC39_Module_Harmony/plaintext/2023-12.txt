Hi all, I just wanted to post here for those who haven't attended the last meeting to mention that we've got Conrad Watt joining us to share some of what is going on in the Wasm threading world. While we're very much working on different approaches, I think it will be valuable to understand where Wasm is going here for us to have a clear picture for how the JS worker ergonomics stories contrast with the new Wasm capabilities. All interested are welcome to join.

Meeting will be the usual time on Thursday, and half the meeting will continue to be follow-ups on the existing agenda.

Hi all, here are the slides shared from Conrad's presentation - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EMXbc8XsVExbYpkv_1E4LD_vstO0tugk/view

I certainly found it very informative myself, and thanks all for the interest and lively debate!
