nicolo-ribaudo: per the JSON modules spec, should `video/lottie+json` be accepted as a valid JSON module? It seems like in HTML it should. I ran a quick test in Chrome and this didn't seem to be the case.

[09:40:04.0322] <guybedford>
ahh it seems this was a recently fixed Chrome bug

[09:40:06.0305] <guybedford>
nvm

[09:51:57.0292] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Yeah it should work because it's a JSON mime type

Thanks! I submitted my proposal here. Let me know if you have any feedback! https://github.com/tc39/agendas/pull/1900

I'd recommend putting at least 30 min, maybe 45. I assume a presentation explaining the use cases and why the feature is needed would take 10-15 minutes, but them I'm sure people will have opinions

[06:44:49.0029] <dminor>
I really see no harm in asking for more time up front, especially this time around with such a light agenda so far.

[07:25:53.0816] <styfle>
nicolo-ribaudo: Thanks I bumped to 30 min https://github.com/tc39/agendas/pull/1901

Do you think 45 would be needed? Not sure how these things work. How long was it for json modules?

[07:37:46.0459] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'll find that info for you later! Or, if you want to look it up yourself, probably look at old agendas looking for the proposal

is it supposed to be correct that `m.foo = 5` assignment where `m` is a ModuleNamespace only throws in strict mode, not in sloppy mode?

[17:39:07.0753] <guybedford>
just spent way too long debugging why in Node.js it was allowed when importing a namespace into a CJS module...

[19:30:51.0811] <kriskowal>
I believe that is expected, and has more to do with sloppy mode than it has to do with modules.

I'm swamped at work and won't make it today

I’m on the docket now to present “Import Hook” at plenary and have reserved the option of asking for Stage 1, so would be delighted to see folks at TG3 and Module Harmony and discuss https://github.com/endojs/proposal-import-hook

[20:22:15.0518] <kriskowal>
And, naugtur has taken on the front seat role for “new Global”, which we expect to be a hard sell and will want to invite everyone to the table https://github.com/endojs/proposal-new-global

[20:23:32.0447] <kriskowal>
What makes this different is that we are not going to ask for a new category of global object, just the ability to replicate existing categories with the option of limiting which observable properties are grafted from the incubating global, without limiting whatever internal slots are needed to function properly in implementations.
