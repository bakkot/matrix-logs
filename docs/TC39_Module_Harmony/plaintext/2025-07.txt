nicolo-ribaudo: per the JSON modules spec, should `video/lottie+json` be accepted as a valid JSON module? It seems like in HTML it should. I ran a quick test in Chrome and this didn't seem to be the case.

[09:40:04.0322] <guybedford>
ahh it seems this was a recently fixed Chrome bug

[09:40:06.0305] <guybedford>
nvm

[09:51:57.0292] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Yeah it should work because it's a JSON mime type

I'd recommend putting at least 30 min, maybe 45. I assume a presentation explaining the use cases and why the feature is needed would take 10-15 minutes, but them I'm sure people will have opinions

I really see no harm in asking for more time up front, especially this time around with such a light agenda so far.

nicolo-ribaudo: Thanks I bumped to 30 min https://github.com/tc39/agendas/pull/1901

Do you think 45 would be needed? Not sure how these things work. How long was it for json modules?
