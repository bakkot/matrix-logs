At plenary, I invited guybedford and MarkM to add ESM Phase Import follow-up to the TG3 docket since thatâ€™s a venue we can all converge upon.

MarkM informs us out-of-band that he has a conflict this Wendesday. I will be available to do a warm-up on the topic and may have tentative slides for framing the implications, but this will not be the high-value meeting if you need to optimize your celendar.

I would be happy to start with an informal discussion on the topic, to follow-up with Mark's meeting in due course

[11:48:31.0080] <guybedford>
I will also be on holiday after this until Jan so maybe we can schedule the main follow-up for Jan 8

So it is written
