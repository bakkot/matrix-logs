At plenary, I invited guybedford and MarkM to add ESM Phase Import follow-up to the TG3 docket since thatâ€™s a venue we can all converge upon.

MarkM informs us out-of-band that he has a conflict this Wendesday. I will be available to do a warm-up on the topic and may have tentative slides for framing the implications, but this will not be the high-value meeting if you need to optimize your celendar.
