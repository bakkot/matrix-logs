At plenary, I invited guybedford and MarkM to add ESM Phase Import follow-up to the TG3 docket since that’s a venue we can all converge upon.

MarkM informs us out-of-band that he has a conflict this Wendesday. I will be available to do a warm-up on the topic and may have tentative slides for framing the implications, but this will not be the high-value meeting if you need to optimize your celendar.

I would be happy to start with an informal discussion on the topic, to follow-up with Mark's meeting in due course

[11:48:31.0080] <guybedford>
I will also be on holiday after this until Jan so maybe we can schedule the main follow-up for Jan 8

So it is written

nicolo-ribaudo: I believe an implication of ESM source phase imports merging in at 2.7 is that module sources + a dynamic import give you a capability to obtain the corresponding instance in the current realm. if/when we generalize this to evaluators or compartments, i think the champions will insist that the dynamic import behavior be scoped to the realm, compartment, or evaluators (what i’m calling the cohort). That seems to oblige us to entrain the notion of a realm-specific module map when or before we look at evaluators. Are there other motivations to absorb a module map in 262?
