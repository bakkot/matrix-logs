I'll use the time to review your node PR

Thanks that would be great!

https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/3582 I think I found a bug with module evaluation, but I think it's a regression

good catch, it seems like we either need to clarify that it can be unset for errored modules, or to set it to some arbitrary value in this case

[09:55:35.0698] <guybedford>
another approach might be to move the CycleRoot set into the linking algorithm, but this would imply creating a proper equivalence between DFS for link and DFS for evaluate which doesn't currently exist

[09:56:50.0390] <guybedford>
The algorithm as written though, never did proper state transitions on error in evaluate (DFS transitions), and that was a property from the start. Sticking with that model would effectively mean just saying [[CycleRoot]] can be unset...

I'm pretty sure this doesn't affects any real execution paths fwiw

[10:23:03.0169] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I opened https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3583, which defaults it to the module itself, and I _think_ it's fine to do it in the error case
