> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> Btw, attendance recently has been a bit low. We might consider re-scheduling the meeting to a different time slot

An hour later would be great! The current time is my final hour of workday (so I have no time beforehand to prep)

My recent absences have been due to health and travel though, which is unrelated to schedule

Ugh on that note, can we meet an hour later today? I now have a client meeting during the current time

[06:26:11.0771] <Chengzhong Wu>
I won't join today due to a conflict...

[06:27:31.0774] <Chengzhong Wu>
an hour later works for me as well (next time)

[06:33:59.0939] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I will also not join today

Are we still meeting at the same time or did we adjust the schedule to be an hour later?

[07:57:37.0904] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh, usually all meetings get cancelled during TC39 week, mostly because most attendees already have 6 hours of meetings at least (and in this case, it was from 3am to 10am in our timezone)

[07:57:55.0303] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I see that somebody removed it from the calendar, but we should have pinged here too, sorry

[08:06:50.0443] <jakobjingleheimer>
Ah great!

[10:47:28.0218] <guybedford>
Just to update on our usual meeting times - despite being at a company event, I should be able to make the meeting next week but will only be able to make the first half hour. Will add an item to the agenda about a possible change of time though.

[16:42:42.0524] <kriskowal>
if the meeting moves to 10am, i’m always available :-)

[16:42:49.0889] <kriskowal>
 * if the meeting moves to 10am Pacific, i’m always available :-)

[16:43:34.0491] <kriskowal>
but the status quo of looping me at tg3 is also fine

[08:02:42.0561] <jakobjingleheimer>
I'm running a few minutes late

[08:03:44.0076] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Meeting now!

It looks like this week's meeting is tied to North America's DST, making it an hour earlier for Europe, which I can't attend.

But also, i need to prep for NodeConf, so I need the time this week for that.

as soon as North America has adjusted we'll be polling on a new time and updating the meeting accordingly, completely understood if in the interim scheduling is tricky

[13:54:26.0042] <Chris de Almeida>
just as the prophecy foretold

[13:57:28.0697] <Chris de Almeida>
 * <del>just as the prophecy foretold</del> nvm that was in async context


2024-10-31
[17:54:33.0840] <guybedford>
and after saying all that it turns out I can't make tomorrow either due to an appointment, so my apologies as well.

[02:17:07.0326] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm on holidays today 

[02:17:17.0054] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Let's just cancel given that most of us cannot attend
