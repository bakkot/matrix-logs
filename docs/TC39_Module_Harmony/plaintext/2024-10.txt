> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> Btw, attendance recently has been a bit low. We might consider re-scheduling the meeting to a different time slot

An hour later would be great! The current time is my final hour of workday (so I have no time beforehand to prep)

My recent absences have been due to health and travel though, which is unrelated to schedule

Ugh on that note, can we meet an hour later today? I now have a client meeting during the current time

[06:26:11.0771] <Chengzhong Wu>
I won't join today due to a conflict...

[06:27:31.0774] <Chengzhong Wu>
an hour later works for me as well (next time)

[06:33:59.0939] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I will also not join today

Are we still meeting at the same time or did we adjust the schedule to be an hour later?

[07:57:37.0904] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh, usually all meetings get cancelled during TC39 week, mostly because most attendees already have 6 hours of meetings at least (and in this case, it was from 3am to 10am in our timezone)

[07:57:55.0303] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I see that somebody removed it from the calendar, but we should have pinged here too, sorry

[08:06:50.0443] <jakobjingleheimer>
Ah great!

Just to update on our usual meeting times - despite being at a company event, I should be able to make the meeting next week but will only be able to make the first half hour. Will add an item to the agenda about a possible change of time though.
