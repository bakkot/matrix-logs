> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> Btw, attendance recently has been a bit low. We might consider re-scheduling the meeting to a different time slot

An hour later would be great! The current time is my final hour of workday (so I have no time beforehand to prep)

My recent absences have been due to health and travel though, which is unrelated to schedule

Ugh on that note, can we meet an hour later today? I now have a client meeting during the current time

I won't join today due to a conflict...

an hour later works for me as well (next time)
