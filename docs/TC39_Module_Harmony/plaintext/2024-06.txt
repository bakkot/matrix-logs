Whatâ€™s the motivation for the AbstractModuleSource methods in the ESM source imports proposal? They feel separate from the stated goals. The rationale that I was able to find was:

> These helper methods are designed to allow for determining the static public exports and public imports of a module, but do not give information about the internal module identifiers or dynamic import.

[08:58:21.0401] <guybedford>
littledan: they are in effect loader primitives, that we can do "while we are specifying it". Also effectively replaces the need for eg https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-module-lexer which clearly is needed.

[08:59:32.0348] <guybedford>
They are somewhat of an orthogonal feature though, that could be worth more explicitly calling out as a use case though certainly. Point taken - I can add some more motivation here around the es-module-lexer use case it solves.
