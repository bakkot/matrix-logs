nicolo-ribaudo guybedford I just dropped a comment, but if discussion is warranted, I’m reminded that we at Agoric insist that all new intrinsics be reachable from globalThis by transitive property walk, until another proposal advances far enough that we’re confident we can reach all intrinsics another way.

So, I suggest keeping globalThis.ModuleSource in Import Parse Phases even if it’s otherwise inert. It also serves as the anchor for ljharb’s brand check accessor in environments in which `WebAssembly.Module` does not exist.

So it would not be constructible but would not be useless.
