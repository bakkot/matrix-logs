looks like compile-time imports for wasm are going to ship: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/zww0CT9PRVw/m/YmtNkC4jAQAJ

[11:28:35.0453] <bakkot>
was there ever a strategy worked out for integrating that with the source-phase imports proposal?

[11:43:49.0953] <littledan (PTO until September 16)>
Source phase imports give you a WebAssembly.Module instance, so then you can instantiate it with that

My understanding was that wasm modules coming from the JS loaders would have js-string enabled by default 

[12:16:10.0229] <guybedford>
Wasm ESM integration will specify that string builtins is enabled for source phase, Luca Casonato mentioned this at our update at the last meeting

right but that's after the `.compile` time when you'd want to enable it

ah, great, sorry I missed that

[12:22:08.0369] <bakkot>
presumably also any other built-ins? at least those which don't add capabilities? (which, IIUC the intention is for them to never add capabilities)

[12:22:59.0224] <guybedford>
I believe the intention is for them not to introduce capabilities under compile-time builtins, and that those are better suited as instantiation imports

[12:23:10.0558] <guybedford>
but we will have to see how things progress too

[12:23:34.0004] <guybedford>
perhaps a future compile time import could "pull in" an instantiation import

[12:23:42.0551] <guybedford>
to represent the capability boundary

[12:23:55.0442] <guybedford>
(I'm not sure I'm just hypothesising)

[12:24:36.0075] <guybedford>
at the very least, we can consider proposals on a case by case basis, and should ensure this feedback is part of any future builtins though

[12:27:14.0167] <bakkot>
that would be a nice way of doing it, yeah

I unfortunately cannot join the meeting today

[08:03:12.0939] <jakobjingleheimer>
I can (i'm in the Meet)

[08:03:49.0759] <Chengzhong Wu>
I have an ad-hoc conflict and can not make it

guybedford shu I wrote down how I would like to see the "Module" vs "Module Source" to be represented in the spec, and what it should mean for two modules to be "the same module".

https://notes.igalia.com/ZuVEtJzHTveQW5yBOSG2vQ

Most of this can apply to scripts if needed, to support shared structs correlation in scripts

[11:08:20.0167] <guybedford>
this looks like the right kind of direction to me

[11:09:46.0404] <guybedford>
Couple of points:
1. Is this purely a refactoring, or, beyond the change of abstraction boundaries with HTML etc - are there real semantic differences at all? It would be nice to see those categorised.
2. Module expressions and module declarations also have the concept of canonical instances, which need to be defined here, and it would be good to have a description of that in this context.

[11:11:36.0982] <nicolo-ribaudo>
This is purely editorial/layering

I am thinking that the canonical instance can be created lazily, and 262 would call into HTML through a hook to query that cache (that HTML can populate in the hook itself)

[03:02:37.0787] <nicolo-ribaudo>
So HTML would check "do I have a canonical instance for this? If not, do I know how to create one?"

[03:02:51.0582] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Which also applies to top-level module sources that are postMessaged to other workers

Is anybody joining today? :)

Btw, attendance recently has been a bit low. We might consider re-scheduling the meeting to a different time

nicolo-ribaudo: Can I trouble you for a link to your proposed 262 module record refactor? Moddable is looking into implementability of virtual Module constructor and it occurs to me that your refactor overlaps https://tc39.es/proposal-compartments/0-module-and-module-source.html
