looks like compile-time imports for wasm are going to ship: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/zww0CT9PRVw/m/YmtNkC4jAQAJ

was there ever a strategy worked out for integrating that with the source-phase imports proposal?

Source phase imports give you a WebAssembly.Module instance, so then you can instantiate it with that

My understanding was that wasm modules coming from the JS loaders would have js-string enabled by default
