is there a meeting today?

[08:14:46.0948] <guybedford>
it was cancelled due to TC39 this week, and then not reinstated, so enjoy the break :)

>due to TC39 this week

what does that mean?

[08:21:25.0925] <guybedford>
I guess strictly speaking we never had TC39 cross-over in timing, but it's still customary to cancel meetings during TC39 weeks

[08:23:52.0034] <Chengzhong Wu>
it's TC39 plenary July 2024 this week: https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/main/2024/07.md. Future dates can be found in this repo as well

[08:32:27.0081] <jakobjingleheimer>
ohh, so there's no calendar to follow or anything that can trigger a notification? (you gotta go looking for updates)

[08:33:59.0633] <Chengzhong Wu>
Hmm, I don't think there is a useful public TC39 calendar.

[08:35:30.0786] <jakobjingleheimer>
how did y'all find out about the plenary? just occasionally check that document?

[08:37:25.0241] <guybedford>
the public calendar is here - https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=37a2107dff15193b42fffa091bc999165695d43b7e4f43b65eab093da2757a3a@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Chicago, but it doesn't seem to include the plenary meetings

[08:37:48.0928] <guybedford>
typically meetings are posted in Reflector issues though

[08:37:50.0623] <Chengzhong Wu>
The simple rule is it happens every 2 month.

Hey, unfortunately I won't be able to join the meeting today and next week

[07:11:31.0906] <jakobjingleheimer>
I also can't (I'll be on an aeroplane)

I assume folks here have seen https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10528, but if not, very much worth checking out

I hadn't; thanks for the link guybedford

[17:15:04.0820] <bakkot>
that looks like very much the wrong design; I've left a comment

I think it deals with the conflict cases pretty well in avoiding overriding anything that was already loaded

[10:22:14.0364] <guybedford>
my main concern is that that algorithm loops all the modules already loaded, and needs to be reconsidered for algorithmic complexity - apps shouldn't significantly slowdown as you load more modules!

[16:43:58.0034] <guybedford>
Didn't someone post here an interest in implementing `export **`?

[16:44:10.0563] <guybedford>
still waiting for that one ha

[16:44:23.0722] <guybedford>
 * Didn't someone post here an interest in specifying `export **`?

[22:24:54.0854] <Aapo Alasuutari>
Yeah, I was at least one of them.

[22:25:54.0658] <Jack Works>
what is that, default including re-export?

[22:25:58.0069] <Aapo Alasuutari>
My work schedule is chock-full with an impending release, but once that is done I'll try to get permission to work on that during office hours.

[22:26:01.0917] <Aapo Alasuutari>
Yeah.

[22:28:05.0157] <Aapo Alasuutari>
We had to set up "export all; import all as temp; export default temp.default || null;" kind of ugly workarounds because we needed a "synthetic redirect" from resource A to resource B without forcing B to be re-evaluated.

you can write this 

[22:29:24.0142] <Jack Works>
export * from 'x'; export { default } from 'x';

[22:39:54.0178] <Aapo Alasuutari>
Except, that's a syntax error if 'x' doesn't have a default export. And if you're a CDN-like backend, you don't usually care to know if there is one or not.

[23:25:58.0206] <Jack Works>
In almost all cases I have handled, I know if the file has a default export or not.

[23:51:57.0040] <Aapo Alasuutari>
That is unfortunately not the case here. Some files are statically known, yes, but we also serve "generic" modules that we do not know the contents of.
