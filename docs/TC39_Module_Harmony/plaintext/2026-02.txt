I'm not sure if this is the best place for this, but I'm in the process of implementing source phase imports and ran into a question about syntax errors for import source declarations: Give code like `import source form "./module.mjs";` (`from` misspelled `form`) should the SyntaxError reflect parsing an `import source` form, or an `import` form? That is, is the `from` keyword missing at `form` or at `"./module.mjs"`?

Interesting question - on first glance I'd say to me it seems most similar to `import form 'x'` which says unexpected string in Node.js for me. So I think "module.mjs" being the unexpected string that should be the from keyword makes sense.
