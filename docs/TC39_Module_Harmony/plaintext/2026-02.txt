I'm not sure if this is the best place for this, but I'm in the process of implementing source phase imports and ran into a question about syntax errors for import source declarations: Give code like `import source form "./module.mjs";` (`from` misspelled `form`) should the SyntaxError reflect parsing an `import source` form, or an `import` form? That is, is the `from` keyword missing at `form` or at `"./module.mjs"`?

[11:17:11.0089] <guybedford>
Interesting question - on first glance I'd say to me it seems most similar to `import form 'x'` which says unexpected string in Node.js for me. So I think "module.mjs" being the unexpected string that should be the from keyword makes sense.

[11:42:27.0807] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Babel also throws at the string, saying "unexpected string, expected token 'from'"

[11:42:58.0268] <dminor>
That was my thought as well. I would also expect that people will avoid `source` as import binding name once `import source` is available to avoid making things confusing, so it would be more useful to report an error on `module.mjs`.

[11:43:45.0940] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Yeah, I think people will stop as soon as editors start coloring source as a keyword

[11:44:55.0276] <guybedford>
yeah agreed we should assume the keyword intent

Hey, tomorrow I'll have a conflict for half of the meeting. I can choose if it's the first or second half.

I'm thinking of only joining the first half, unless other people here prefer otherwise 

[11:07:23.0578] <guybedford>
It looks like there's currently no formal agenda items, so first half should work absolutely fine

Hi all, we are going to move next weeks meeting earlier one hour earlier to help avoid the WhatNOT conflict for this one time.

If you are interested in attending and the new time will be an issue for you, please let me know.
