> <@lucacasonato:matrix.org> What do you all think about making the loader meeting 1 hour again, but doing it weekly rather than bi-weekly? Please vote below:

Don't forget to vote in this, if you have a preference :) We can update the schedule starting from next week

Can we rename this room to "TC39 Modules", since we are mostly using it for coordination across al the proposals?

It'd be great if JavaScript could catch up with CSS here--our equivalent is module declarations!

Is there any way we could move the upcoming module harmony meeting? e.g., to two hours earlier than its current slot

[07:56:06.0462] <littledan>
or, the day before at the same time

[07:56:24.0440] <littledan>
I mean, for the meeting on 5/2, in a week and a day

For context, littledan Luca Casonato and I won't be able to join on 5/2 at the usual time

littledan: I think there is precedence for [[Prototype]] override in webidl:

> https://console.spec.whatwg.org/#namespacedef-console
>
> For historical web-compatibility reasons, the namespace object for console must have as its [[Prototype]] an empty object, created as if by ObjectCreate(%ObjectPrototype%), instead of %ObjectPrototype%.

[09:30:48.0238] <Luca Casonato>
And WebIDL allows this:

> https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#ecmascript-binding
>
> Unless otherwise specified, the [[Prototype]] internal slot of objects defined in this section is %Object.prototype%.

Ah OK all good then!

Welcome back Kris Kowal (back April 27)! :)

[06:20:49.0413] <nicolo-ribaudo>
During the last call we decided to move the next occurrence of our meeting (Tuesday, May 2nd, 18:00 UTC) to the day before one hour later than usual (Monday, Maya 1st, 19:00 UTC), to accomodate multiple conflicts.

All the people in the call were ok with this, but ping Justin Ridgewell Jack Works Mathieu Hofman (and Kris Kowal (back April 27)!) since you participate often and weren't there when this was discussed.

[06:20:51.0255] <nicolo-ribaudo>
(Also, we should start writing in the notes who attends the meetings, since trying to remember who is usually there and who isn't is difficult üòÖ)

[07:20:43.0085] <Mathieu Hofman>
Are you sure you meant UTC and not CET?

[07:21:03.0433] <Mathieu Hofman>
One hour later I believe would be 10am PDT, which does create a conflict for anyone at Agoric.

[07:21:15.0528] <Mathieu Hofman>
* One hour later I believe would be 10am PDT, which does create a conflict for anyone at Agoric on Mondays

[07:28:06.0796] <Kris Kowal>
Yes, Monday at 10am is an unevadable conflict for us at Agoric.

[07:28:15.0758] <Kris Kowal>
Tuesdays at 10am Pacific are fine.

[07:28:41.0250] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Uhm yes I definitely got my timezones wrong, usually it's not at 18:00 UTC but CET

[07:29:30.0127] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Would one our _earlier_ than usual, or two hours later, work for you at Agoric?
(I might have to set up a Doodle at this point)

[07:35:22.0129] <Kris Kowal>
Two hours later would work for us. One hour earlier would not work for me.

Sorry for my delay in voting. Looks like ‚ÄúTwo hours later on Monday‚Äù is the winner so far.
