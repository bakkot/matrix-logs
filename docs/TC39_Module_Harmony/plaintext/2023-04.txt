> <@lucacasonato:matrix.org> What do you all think about making the loader meeting 1 hour again, but doing it weekly rather than bi-weekly? Please vote below:

Don't forget to vote in this, if you have a preference :) We can update the schedule starting from next week

❗️ FYI, the schedule has now been updated to weekly on Tuesdays, with 1 hour duration. The meeting calendar has been updated already. ❗️

Can we rename this room to "TC39 Modules", since we are mostly using it for coordination across al the proposals?

It'd be great if JavaScript could catch up with CSS here--our equivalent is module declarations!

Is there any way we could move the upcoming module harmony meeting? e.g., to two hours earlier than its current slot

[07:56:06.0462] <littledan>
or, the day before at the same time

[07:56:24.0440] <littledan>
I mean, for the meeting on 5/2, in a week and a day

For context, littledan Luca Casonato and I won't be able to join on 5/2 at the usual time

littledan: I think there is precedence for [[Prototype]] override in webidl:

> https://console.spec.whatwg.org/#namespacedef-console
>
> For historical web-compatibility reasons, the namespace object for console must have as its [[Prototype]] an empty object, created as if by ObjectCreate(%ObjectPrototype%), instead of %ObjectPrototype%.

[09:30:48.0238] <Luca Casonato>
And WebIDL allows this:

> https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#ecmascript-binding
>
> Unless otherwise specified, the [[Prototype]] internal slot of objects defined in this section is %Object.prototype%.

Ah OK all good then!
