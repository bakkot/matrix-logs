Kris Kowal: only just saw this. We are maintaining the discussion points and notes as people take them in the agenda document at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CD5lIBZLl24XBWbQhokqBdt4Zl7wPAcFJKJrgePr9HU/edit?usp=sharing. Recent meetings have been sparse on note taking, will try to correct that.

i unfortunately can't join the meeting today - have a bunch of other things ongoing

[07:52:47.0440] <nicolo-ribaudo>
it'll also be difficult for me to join -- guybedford I reviewed your PR and it looks great, do you plan to present at next plenary? If so I'd be happy to review slides :)

Chengzhong Wu For the label on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3980, feel free to ignore it. Apparently test262 maintainers add that label for "anything that links to an open PR", and the reason other stage 3 proposals don't have it is just because the maintainers forgot to add the label
