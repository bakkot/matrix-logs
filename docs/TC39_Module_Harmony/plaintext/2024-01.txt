Kris Kowal: only just saw this. We are maintaining the discussion points and notes as people take them in the agenda document at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CD5lIBZLl24XBWbQhokqBdt4Zl7wPAcFJKJrgePr9HU/edit?usp=sharing. Recent meetings have been sparse on note taking, will try to correct that.

i unfortunately can't join the meeting today - have a bunch of other things ongoing

it'll also be difficult for me to join -- guybedford I reviewed your PR and it looks great, do you plan to present at next plenary? If so I'd be happy to review slides :)
