Modules call in 20 minutes!

[09:02:23.0534] <Kris Kowal>
I’m in the lobby 🥤🍿

[09:05:19.0205] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Same

it seems more nonsense-y than last time

I’ve posted an update of the First-class Module/ModuleSource layer to reflect Caridy’s spec text https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments/pull/82

is there a shared calendar event for the modules call or everyone managing their own? if there is a shared one, can i get an invite please? 

[07:05:01.0761] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It's on the tc39 events calendar, let me find the link

I wanted to say “has it gone from comedic to tragic?” but on closer inspection, this has some strong Yeats energy.

Updated explainer for Module and ModuleSource constructors, Layer 0 https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments/blob/efddb65a626f99aa15ee8f15cee64bcb6f735679/0-module-and-module-source.md#first-class-module-and-modulesource

I opened https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments/pull/83 to adapt layer 0 on top of the host hooks refactor

I plan to attend the Module Harmony call today, but will not be able to speak due to a very temporary but inconvenient illness.

[07:33:37.0184] <Kris Kowal>
I believe we need to talk about our intentions regarding advancement, particularly for First-class Module and ModuleSource (from Compartments: Layer 0) and Module Blocks. In my opinion, we should ask for Stage 2 for Module and ModuleSource constructors. I don’t have strong feelings about coupling with Module Blocks (I think Nicolò has done good work keeping the proposals loosely coupled) but I do share @ljharb’s opinion that it would be _exceedingly weird_ if Module Blocks landed and we never managed to pull Module Constructor over the line, since that would leave us with an always-throws `Module` constructor indefinitely.

[07:35:11.0362] <Kris Kowal>
And I _do_ like to continue framing these proposals as ordered incremental advancements, just for sake of reviewability, but if folks overwhelmingly wanted to mix them in a big pot, I wouldn’t resist.

[07:36:28.0412] <Kris Kowal>
I would like to convince @caridy that he or we should put Layer 0 on the agenda for A Coruña.

[07:59:32.0301] <shu>
i cannot attend today, might be checking out some wasm in-person cg stuff this week

I agree: I don't think the proposals should be too copuled, but I don't want to have a future JavaScript with just module blocks and with Layer 0 objected.

[08:13:34.0409] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Well, I guess if that unfortunate case happens we could make `new Module` accept a string, after being certain that Layer 0 cannot advance as-is

[08:15:31.0690] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm not feeling well too, so I'm not sure if I will attend (but I started not feeling well suddenly, so it might end suddenly soon, who knows)

EDIT: I'll join

I also can't attend today, sorry

Hmm, I guess I wouldn't mind this end state

[10:23:58.0492] <Kris Kowal>
I was unable to find an issue regarding Module.prototype.import, so I’ve created one https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments/issues/85
