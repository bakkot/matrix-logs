I'm updating the README for the decorators repo, it's been quite a while. I think it's time we update the recommendation for usage in transpilers to using the most recent spec, given it has been fairly stable and in stage 3 for quite some time now. Any objections?

Note that Babel still doesn't implement the latest version, we'll release it in a couple weeks

I joined in case there are questions about Function or Parameter decorators.
