Decorators after export looks terrible. I'm still unhappy with that decision (or non-decision). The following is from a test for stage-3 decorators support (TypeScript needs to support both, even if we will error on decorators before in JS :

```js
// @filename: file2.ts

@dec1
@dec2
export class D {
}

@dec1
@dec2
export default class E {
}

// @filename: file3.ts

export
@dec1
@dec2
class F {
}

export default
@dec1
@dec2
class G {
}
```

that's a very subjective viewpoint that i happen to disagree with ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I think this depends on whether you see `export` as part of the class declaration or not

iirc TSC sees export as a modifier of the class (like abstract), but I see it as a separate thing and I would find it very confusing to not have the class immediately after the decorator
