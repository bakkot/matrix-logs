Hi all, I'm currently doing some research on what to implement for decorators in Oxc, according to https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators?tab=readme-ov-file#how-does-this-proposal-compare-to-other-versions-of-decorators, are we kind of stuck of having to implement both legacy and stage 3 for the ecosystem?

> and the possibilty of moving back to stage 2.7

I'm also feeling lost on which conformance suite to follow from different implementations, would be great if it is converged to test262.

There is a wip PR at https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4103 for tests
