Hi all, I'm currently doing some research on what to implement for decorators in Oxc, according to https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators?tab=readme-ov-file#how-does-this-proposal-compare-to-other-versions-of-decorators, are we kind of stuck of having to implement both legacy and stage 3 for the ecosystem?
