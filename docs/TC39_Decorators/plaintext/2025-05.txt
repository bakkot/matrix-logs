https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators/issues/476#issuecomment-2907904272 - this is becoming a discussion that seems off topic for the issue which is causing repeated pings to people who might want to know about the actual topic. Should we mark the comments around proposal process and stage decisions as off topic and collapse them? I don't have permission to do it.
