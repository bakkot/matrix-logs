need a rubber stamp on this from anyone -- dependabot PR was unmergeable due to a codeQL issue that I was able to resolve, but I couldn't reopen the PR due to force push

Hey all, Aki still manages the DNS record for TC39.es and wants to hand it over because it is getting lots of hits and costing her money. 

[23:51:28.0530] <Rob Palmer>
Is there a way we can transfer ownership and or reduce costs?

[23:51:59.0753] <Rob Palmer>
jasew: Maybe you could invite Aki here? 

[01:20:55.0477] <jasew>
Yeah I can reach out 

[06:46:56.0829] <Aki>
Heyyyyy

[06:48:06.0960] <Chris de Almeida>
> getting lots of hits and costing her money

more than the yearly domain registration cost? 

[06:48:30.0424] <Aki>
I made a spreadsheet of the DNS records I have. I could have sworn I owned the domain but I guess not?

[06:48:57.0347] <Aki>
I got enough requests in the last 36 hours that I expect the bill will be about $100

[06:49:11.0644] <Aki>
Usually itâ€™s $0.01-$0.02

[06:52:41.0335] <Chris de Almeida>
ok so this is just for the DNS server, not domain transfer?

[06:53:34.0404] <Aki>
Correct. No clue who owns the domain. Probably ECMA itself? My memory is broken and PayPal deletes emails after 3 years so my information is limited. 

[06:54:35.0938] <Aki>
So basically youâ€™ll need to change the nameservers at the registrar to use either their DNS or someone else on the committee, and then update that DNS with the spreadsheet

[06:55:36.0261] <Aki>
Also in my research I discovered I own tc39.org but itâ€™s apparently just parked right now? Happy to transfer it to anyone else, I apparently just renewed it a week ago

[06:58:57.0732] <Chris de Almeida>
```
Domain Name: 
tc39.es 

Registrant: 
----------- 

Registrant Name: Ecma International

Iâ€™m a bit lost, why are we paying for a dns server? And whoâ€™s it with? Is this not something which can be put on a Cloudflare free tier or something? How many hits is it getting? Also @Aki why do you have the dns but not the domain?

[07:07:42.0921] <Aki>
I donâ€™t remember. Itâ€™s on my route53 account. Presumably because we didnâ€™t want to have to email Istvan and wait for weeks every time someone wanted to add a subdomain?

[07:08:21.0159] <Chris de Almeida>
we can transfer it to me -- I already pay for DNS for a bunch of my domains, and this wouldn't add anything to my costs.  confirmed 3rd party domains are included

[07:09:06.0755] <Chris de Almeida>
chairs meeting is this morning, we can discuss and proceed thusly if there are no objections

[07:09:14.0551] <Aki>
Double-check if you pay by requests. There have been at least 100,000,000 in the past day and a half. >.<
