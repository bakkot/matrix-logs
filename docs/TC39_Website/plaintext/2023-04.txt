I just created an issue

Feel free to work on this, share with your friends, or share on social! (it could be an opportunity for someone to make a new contribution! 😄)

Can anyone confirm this?

Thank you so much! Chris de Almeida

need a rubber stamp on this from anyone -- dependabot PR was unmergeable due to a codeQL issue that I was able to resolve, but I couldn't reopen the PR due to force push

Hey all, Aki still manages the DNS record for TC39.es and wants to hand it over because it is getting lots of hits and costing her money. 

[23:51:28.0530] <Rob Palmer>
Is there a way we can transfer ownership and or reduce costs?

[23:51:59.0753] <Rob Palmer>
jasew: Maybe you could invite Aki here? 

[01:20:55.0477] <jasew>
Yeah I can reach out 

[06:46:56.0829] <Aki>
Heyyyyy

[06:48:06.0960] <Chris de Almeida>
> getting lots of hits and costing her money

more than the yearly domain registration cost? 

[06:48:30.0424] <Aki>
I made a spreadsheet of the DNS records I have. I could have sworn I owned the domain but I guess not?

[06:48:57.0347] <Aki>
I got enough requests in the last 36 hours that I expect the bill will be about $100

[06:49:11.0644] <Aki>
Usually it’s $0.01-$0.02

[06:52:41.0335] <Chris de Almeida>
ok so this is just for the DNS server, not domain transfer?

[06:53:34.0404] <Aki>
Correct. No clue who owns the domain. Probably ECMA itself? My memory is broken and PayPal deletes emails after 3 years so my information is limited. 

[06:54:35.0938] <Aki>
So basically you’ll need to change the nameservers at the registrar to use either their DNS or someone else on the committee, and then update that DNS with the spreadsheet

[06:55:36.0261] <Aki>
Also in my research I discovered I own tc39.org but it’s apparently just parked right now? Happy to transfer it to anyone else, I apparently just renewed it a week ago

[06:58:57.0732] <Chris de Almeida>
```
Domain Name: 
tc39.es

[07:06:41.0889] <jasew>
I’m a bit lost, why are we paying for a dns server? And who’s it with? Is this not something which can be put on a Cloudflare free tier or something? How many hits is it getting? Also @Aki why do you have the dns but not the domain?

[07:07:42.0921] <Aki>
I don’t remember. It’s on my route53 account. Presumably because we didn’t want to have to email Istvan and wait for weeks every time someone wanted to add a subdomain?

[07:08:21.0159] <Chris de Almeida>
we can transfer it to me -- I already pay for DNS for a bunch of my domains, and this wouldn't add anything to my costs.  confirmed 3rd party domains are included

[07:09:06.0755] <Chris de Almeida>
chairs meeting is this morning, we can discuss and proceed thusly if there are no objections

[07:09:14.0551] <Aki>
Double-check if you pay by requests. There have been at least 100,000,000 in the past day and a half. >.<

[07:10:28.0364] <jasew>
Dayum, the spec is popular

[07:10:35.0749] <Aki>
Lolllll

[07:10:55.0108] <Chris de Almeida>
yikes... well there is DDoS protection...

[07:16:06.0765] <jasew>
Preferably it doesn’t land somewhere where we pay by the requests, I assume Chris de Almeida doesn’t have that 

[07:19:34.0105] <Chris de Almeida>
right, good to go

[07:22:05.0488] <Aki>
So lmk when I can delete the hosted zone in R53? And I’ll stop worrying about it in the meantime. 

[08:45:16.0399] <Sora Morimoto>
I can help with that as one of the people with experience working with the large scale network stuff :)

[08:47:50.0617] <Sora Morimoto>
I have indeed observed something silly about DNS in the last few months in some environments and this seems not just for TC39 to me 🤷‍♂️

[08:56:58.0691] <Sora Morimoto>
Something like DNS water torture seems to be happening worldwide

[08:57:06.0016] <jasew>
Where are you seeing this Sora?

[08:59:08.0513] <Sora Morimoto>
This is a random one my coworker shared with me, but I can also check my resolver's logs

[09:02:32.0708] <Sora Morimoto>
Perhaps the best thing to do is to contact friends at Cloudflare to set up a special account for us. Then it would be best if all domains could be managed with proper permission management. (Recently, Cloudflare has started to roll out a feature that gives you more fine-grained control for permissions.)

[09:05:44.0283] <Sora Morimoto>
The source of the attack, by the way, is almost all over the internet 🤷‍♂️ (although the main nodes causing the outages are in specific data centers)
And there are a thousand different targets to attack, just like carpet-bombing 😵‍💫 It's weird what the purpose is, but it also looks like a systematic exploration of weaknesses 🤔

[09:09:46.0776] <Sora Morimoto>
Anyway! I will contact my friends at Cloudflare asap if we need to! Or we can go the hard way to manage it ourselves - DO NOT WORRY! I know a pretty good network operator! who I can talk to 😄

[09:09:52.0192] <Sora Morimoto>
(It's an obvious silly joke)

[10:15:54.0471] <Chris de Almeida>
working on getting the nameservers updated.  unfortunately, we need Ecma to do this and it's already Friday night in Geneva.  I did send the request with urgency so...  we'll see.  worst case scenario we can set up a gofundme for the DNS bill prior to the switch 🙂

[10:38:46.0336] <jasew>
Does anyone know who Ecma have the site hosted with? And does anyone else have access? 

[10:39:35.0046] <Chris de Almeida>
it's GH pages

[10:41:02.0257] <jasew>
Sorry, I mean who the  domain is with, and access to change things like nameservers 

[10:48:02.0020] <Chris de Almeida>
the domain registrar, yes

[10:48:10.0016] <Chris de Almeida>
```

[10:50:07.0162] <jasew>
ECMA are the registrar themselves? So only someone from ecma can change nameservers I guess 

[10:53:37.0019] <Chris de Almeida>
right

[10:55:29.0224] <Chris de Almeida>
we already sent the request -- just probably unlikely to get updated till next week.  BUT -- the new DNS records are already in place, and once Aki adds the authorization record to her DNS config, we can confirm propagation, and technically, she could remove all the DNS records on her side (although that would not be ideal, as it could result in some downtime due to DNS caching and propagation, etC)

[12:30:55.0569] <ljharb>
i have dnsimple and don't pay per usage, if that helps

[12:31:11.0687] <ljharb>
 * i have dnsimple and don't pay per usage, if that helps (ah, reading back it seems like ecma will have it which is better)

[12:32:00.0655] <ljharb>
Aki: i hope you also send ecma a reimbursement request as well for all historical expenses you shouldn't have had to pay out of pocket <3

[15:12:25.0243] <Aki>
ljharb: historically it was like 1-2 cents per month so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
