Can anyone confirm this?

Thank you so much! Chris de Almeida

need a rubber stamp on this from anyone -- dependabot PR was unmergeable due to a codeQL issue that I was able to resolve, but I couldn't reopen the PR due to force push

Hey all, Aki still manages the DNS record for TC39.es and wants to hand it over because it is getting lots of hits and costing her money. 

[23:51:28.0530] <Rob Palmer>
Is there a way we can transfer ownership and or reduce costs?

[23:51:59.0753] <Rob Palmer>
jasew: Maybe you could invite Aki here? 

[01:20:55.0477] <jasew>
Yeah I can reach out 

[06:46:56.0829] <Aki>
Heyyyyy

[06:48:06.0960] <Chris de Almeida>
> getting lots of hits and costing her money

more than the yearly domain registration cost? 

[06:48:30.0424] <Aki>
I made a spreadsheet of the DNS records I have. I could have sworn I owned the domain but I guess not?

[06:48:57.0347] <Aki>
I got enough requests in the last 36 hours that I expect the bill will be about $100

[06:49:11.0644] <Aki>
Usually it‚Äôs $0.01-$0.02

[06:52:41.0335] <Chris de Almeida>
ok so this is just for the DNS server, not domain transfer?

[06:53:34.0404] <Aki>
Correct. No clue who owns the domain. Probably ECMA itself? My memory is broken and PayPal deletes emails after 3 years so my information is limited. 

[06:54:35.0938] <Aki>
So basically you‚Äôll need to change the nameservers at the registrar to use either their DNS or someone else on the committee, and then update that DNS with the spreadsheet

[06:55:36.0261] <Aki>
Also in my research I discovered I own tc39.org but it‚Äôs apparently just parked right now? Happy to transfer it to anyone else, I apparently just renewed it a week ago

[06:58:57.0732] <Chris de Almeida>
```
Domain Name: 
tc39.es 

Registrant: 
----------- 

Registrant Name: Ecma International

>>> LAST UPDATE: 28/04/2023 14:11:02
```

[07:06:41.0889] <jasew>
I‚Äôm a bit lost, why are we paying for a dns server? And who‚Äôs it with? Is this not something which can be put on a Cloudflare free tier or something? How many hits is it getting? Also @Aki why do you have the dns but not the domain?

[07:07:42.0921] <Aki>
I don‚Äôt remember. It‚Äôs on my route53 account. Presumably because we didn‚Äôt want to have to email Istvan and wait for weeks every time someone wanted to add a subdomain?

[07:08:21.0159] <Chris de Almeida>
we can transfer it to me -- I already pay for DNS for a bunch of my domains, and this wouldn't add anything to my costs.  confirmed 3rd party domains are included

[07:09:06.0755] <Chris de Almeida>
chairs meeting is this morning, we can discuss and proceed thusly if there are no objections

[07:09:14.0551] <Aki>
Double-check if you pay by requests. There have been at least 100,000,000 in the past day and a half. >.<

[07:10:28.0364] <jasew>
Dayum, the spec is popular

[07:10:35.0749] <Aki>
Lolllll

[07:10:55.0108] <Chris de Almeida>
yikes... well there is DDoS protection...

[07:16:06.0765] <jasew>
Preferably it doesn‚Äôt land somewhere where we pay by the requests, I assume Chris de Almeida doesn‚Äôt have that 

[07:19:34.0105] <Chris de Almeida>
right, good to go

[07:22:05.0488] <Aki>
So lmk when I can delete the hosted zone in R53? And I‚Äôll stop worrying about it in the meantime. 

[08:45:16.0399] <Sora Morimoto>
I can help with that as one of the people with experience working with the large scale network stuff :)

[08:47:50.0617] <Sora Morimoto>
I have indeed observed something silly about DNS in the last few months in some environments and this seems not just for TC39 to me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[08:56:58.0691] <Sora Morimoto>
Something like DNS water torture seems to be happening worldwide

[08:57:06.0016] <jasew>
Where are you seeing this Sora?

[08:59:08.0513] <Sora Morimoto>
This is a random one my coworker shared with me, but I can also check my resolver's logs

[09:02:32.0708] <Sora Morimoto>
Perhaps the best thing to do is to contact friends at Cloudflare to set up a special account for us. Then it would be best if all domains could be managed with proper permission management. (Recently, Cloudflare has started to roll out a feature that gives you more fine-grained control for permissions.)

[09:05:44.0283] <Sora Morimoto>
The source of the attack, by the way, is almost all over the internet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (although the main nodes causing the outages are in specific data centers)
And there are a thousand different targets to attack, just like carpet-bombing üòµ‚Äçüí´ It's weird what the purpose is, but it also looks like a systematic exploration of weaknesses ü§î

[09:09:46.0776] <Sora Morimoto>
Anyway! I will contact my friends at Cloudflare asap if we need to! Or we can go the hard way to manage it ourselves - DO NOT WORRY! I know a pretty good network operator! who I can talk to üòÑ

[09:09:52.0192] <Sora Morimoto>
(It's an obvious silly joke)

[10:15:54.0471] <Chris de Almeida>
working on getting the nameservers updated.  unfortunately, we need Ecma to do this and it's already Friday night in Geneva.  I did send the request with urgency so...  we'll see.  worst case scenario we can set up a gofundme for the DNS bill prior to the switch üôÇ

[10:38:46.0336] <jasew>
Does anyone know who Ecma have the site hosted with? And does anyone else have access? 

[10:39:35.0046] <Chris de Almeida>
it's GH pages

[10:41:02.0257] <jasew>
Sorry, I mean who the  domain is with, and access to change things like nameservers
