need a rubber stamp on this from anyone -- dependabot PR was unmergeable due to a codeQL issue that I was able to resolve, but I couldn't reopen the PR due to force push

Hey all, Aki still manages the DNS record for TC39.es and wants to hand it over because it is getting lots of hits and costing her money. 

[23:51:28.0530] <Rob Palmer>
Is there a way we can transfer ownership and or reduce costs?

[23:51:59.0753] <Rob Palmer>
jasew: Maybe you could invite Aki here? 

[01:20:55.0477] <jasew>
Yeah I can reach out

Heyyyyy

[06:48:06.0960] <Chris de Almeida>
> getting lots of hits and costing her money

more than the yearly domain registration cost? 

[06:48:30.0424] <Aki>
I made a spreadsheet of the DNS records I have. I could have sworn I owned the domain but I guess not?

[06:48:57.0347] <Aki>
I got enough requests in the last 36 hours that I expect the bill will be about $100

[06:49:11.0644] <Aki>
Usually itâ€™s $0.01-$0.02
