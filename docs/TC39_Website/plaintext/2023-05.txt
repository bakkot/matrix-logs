Patrick Luthi confirmed the nameservers for `tc39.es` have been updated touse the unmetered `freedns1.registrar-servers.com`.  I think TTLs may mean it will be 24 hours to take effect.

Aki had TTL set to 5 minutes only -- in any case, I asked her to wait a few days before removing her records.  no harm in that

Why are there 4 A records per server for the same domain pointing to a different IP. Is there some load balancing going on there? Or just the way that UI is displaying it?
