Patrick Luthi confirmed the nameservers for `tc39.es` have been updated touse the unmetered `freedns1.registrar-servers.com`.  I think TTLs may mean it will be 24 hours to take effect.

looking good, all five nameservers appear with all A records for GH

Aki had TTL set to 5 minutes only -- in any case, I asked her to wait a few days before removing her records.  no harm in that

Why are there 4 A records per server for the same domain pointing to a different IP. Is there some load balancing going on there? Or just the way that UI is displaying it?

GH pages redundancy I guess ðŸ¤·

One of my colleagues at Mozilla pointed out this site to me: https://test262.report/. He found it useful for tracking status across implementers. It was being maintained by bocoup, but they stopped last autumn due to some changes to services made by CircleCI that the site relied upon. I thought I would mention it here, in case someone was interested in taking over the maintenance or adding something similar to the tc39.es site.

i think lots of folks are interested in maintaining it, the trouble is finding someone to pay for it, and potentially also convincing bocoup to donate it

[10:34:57.0317] <Chris de Almeida>
yeah, I would hope the first step is making the assets available
