rkirsling, ljharb: since you've contributed to Ecmarkup in the past, do you think it would be worthwhile to create an issue as a feature request for a new custom element that would enable representing these diagrams for use in ECMA-404?

> <@dereknongeneric:mozilla.org> ljharb: sweet; doubtful anyone will beat you to it, but it would be interesting to see what that thing looks like as a word document if you would be able to drag and drop it in here (not sure if possible)

septs: curious why you closed that issue the other day; is it just not needed or was that an accident? https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io/issues/221
