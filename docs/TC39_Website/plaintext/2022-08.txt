For me VSCode enforces the rules from editorConfig, some IDE enforce it built in so it is useful to have

You’re right in that there’s no tooling on the project side to check it’s being enforced but I don’t think it’s for that. That being said I think Prettier respects it

Looks like you’ve already set up the prettier editorConfig link up DerekNonGeneric sorry I missed that

[05:57:39.0563] <ryzokuken>
I don't think editorconfig is supposed to be _enforced_, quite the other way around. 

[05:57:50.0803] <ryzokuken>
Perhaps what you need are ESLint rules instead?

[05:59:00.0837] <jasew>
I agree ryzokuken for me it’s more to make sure the IDEs are following consistent rules, that being said I think DerekNonGenerics point is that there’s nothing stopping tooling ignoring it and PRing anyway.

Prettier should catch most of them

can someone give me the necessary permission to push a branch to remote on [tc39/tc39.github.io](https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io) ?
