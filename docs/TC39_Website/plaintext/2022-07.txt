The menu button in https://tc39.es/code-of-conduct/ doesn’t seem to work for me in portrait orientation on iOS 15.5. 

[05:59:55.0472] <jschoi>
It seems to have a different design than the home page’s menu button, which does work for me.

the code of conduct page is managed separately from the tc39 website repo, can you add an issue here: https://github.com/tc39/code-of-conduct

is anyone around that can reopen that issue i mentioned above? i wouldn't mind taking a stab at it with maybe a little help from Sora Morimoto on the translations ^^

[13:22:02.0929] <jasew>
DerekNonGeneric: I've reopened it

[13:23:19.0339] <DerekNonGeneric>
awesome, thanks much jasew!

[13:26:00.0658] <DerekNonGeneric>
btw, i found a slight innacuracy in the README that claims the site is still built using Jekyll https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io/blame/master/README.md#L6

[13:47:55.0836] <DerekNonGeneric>
i wanted to change it to say: "built with GitHub Pages using a Jekyll alternative", but wasn't sure what you all might think about that; i think it sounds a little more accurate than currently

[14:01:44.0061] <jasew>
Nice spot.
It's built using eleventy so we should probably just mention that, rather than calling it a "Jekyll alternative"

[14:04:38.0500] <ljharb>
or maybe not mention it at all, does anyone really care what it's built with?

[14:04:41.0921] <ljharb>
they can go look at the repo for that

[14:20:43.0079] <DerekNonGeneric>
the appeal of having it stated there might've been due to there being so many people already familiar with that publishing workflow (many feel skilled enough to work on it), but it might not be such a bad idea to leave out any opinionated stack details on the second line there. eleventy's tag line (as seen on their github repo's description) is "A simpler static site generator. An alternative to Jekyll." -- that was my rationale, but happy to pr any correction you all would prefer https://github.com/11ty/eleventy

[14:21:59.0334] <ljharb>
but like, readers of the site shouldn't be thinking about that

[14:22:16.0630] <ljharb>
have a link to the github repo somewhere - like one of those dog-ears in the upper corner with a github logo - for those curious about that

[14:26:47.0218] <jasew>
__This site is built using GitHub Pages and Jekyll and is currently an MVP. We are looking for feedback from people of all areas.__ Im fine with removing this sentance

[14:51:32.0024] <DerekNonGeneric>
alright, taken care of in https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io/pull/286 -- going to see about getting that other one taken care of now
