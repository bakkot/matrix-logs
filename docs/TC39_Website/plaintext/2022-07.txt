The menu button in https://tc39.es/code-of-conduct/ doesn’t seem to work for me in portrait orientation on iOS 15.5. 

[05:59:55.0472] <jschoi>
It seems to have a different design than the home page’s menu button, which does work for me.

the code of conduct page is managed separately from the tc39 website repo, can you add an issue here: https://github.com/tc39/code-of-conduct

is anyone around that can reopen that issue i mentioned above? i wouldn't mind taking a stab at it with maybe a little help from Sora Morimoto on the translations ^^

DerekNonGeneric: I've reopened it

[13:23:19.0339] <DerekNonGeneric>
awesome, thanks much jasew!

btw, i found a slight innacuracy in the README that claims the site is still built using Jekyll https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io/blame/master/README.md#L6

i wanted to change it to say: "built with GitHub Pages using a Jekyll alternative", but wasn't sure what you all might think about that; i think it sounds a little more accurate than currently

Nice spot.
It's built using eleventy so we should probably just mention that, rather than calling it a "Jekyll alternative"

[14:04:38.0500] <ljharb>
or maybe not mention it at all, does anyone really care what it's built with?

[14:04:41.0921] <ljharb>
they can go look at the repo for that
