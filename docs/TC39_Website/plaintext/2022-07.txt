The menu button in https://tc39.es/code-of-conduct/ doesn’t seem to work for me in portrait orientation on iOS 15.5.

It seems to have a different design than the home page’s menu button, which does work for me.

the code of conduct page is managed separately from the tc39 website repo, can you add an issue here: https://github.com/tc39/code-of-conduct
