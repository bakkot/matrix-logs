Now our site somehow gets the status of proposals from stages instead of stage3...

[00:14:01.0397] <Sora Morimoto>
The ideal process would be to regularly update the stage3 file with GitHub Actions, then fallback to the English file if a proposal state is not found in the Japanese file, while the maintainers update the translated files.

[00:14:05.0858] <Sora Morimoto>
What do you think?
