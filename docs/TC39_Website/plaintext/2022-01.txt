Quite weird. Does that still happen? Honestly, the project is not that complex/annoying as to need to use Docker, so I have never used it and have never seen the problem...

I just checked out the tc39.github.io repo, and it is _so_ cursed

[07:08:37.0069] <ryzokuken>
why does it need a Gemfile, a Dockerfile, a Makefile and still some more? It's still a static website, right?

[07:10:37.0728] <ryzokuken>
https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io#discussion this needs updating too fwiw

[07:12:23.0595] <Sora Morimoto>
Yes, all the classic GitHub Pages projects are cursed. Honestly, we knew somewhere that we should change this, but no one could get rid of the curse...

[07:14:06.0511] <ryzokuken>
I mean, Jekyll is... Jekyll but why Java?

[07:14:39.0524] <ryzokuken>
You don't need Docker or Java to build a Jekyll site, right?

[07:15:40.0473] <Sora Morimoto>
It's not Java anyway (*But it's the same with Ruby...)

[07:16:36.0681] <Sora Morimoto>
To be more exact, I think it would not have been too much trouble with not changing that, but it's a good opportunity to rethink this, let's do that

[07:27:14.0744] <ryzokuken>
let's port the website

[07:27:20.0835] <ryzokuken>
 * let's port the website

[07:27:30.0458] <ryzokuken>
to a lightweight JS generator

[07:27:32.0376] <ryzokuken>
11ty?

[07:30:23.0816] <Sora Morimoto>
I don't know which one is good as I make such a tool by myself every time. as long as no one objects to using 11ty, go with it

[07:33:05.0764] <Hemanth H.M>
11ty++

Feel free to blame me for the Dockerfile, I added that way back when. My reasoning was because there were a lot of dependencies at the time and not everyone had everything. So Docker put us all on the same level. I agree it could be much simpler. I didnâ€™t want to install Ruby on my local machine 

I didnâ€™t choose the web framework, it was already ruby when I came across it.

[09:22:34.0522] <ryzokuken>
jasew: I don't blame you at all, sorry if I came off as that. I just think the dockerfile is a sign of a deeper issue (as you mentioned in this case, hard to setup environment).

[09:23:46.0928] <ryzokuken>
Given how simple the website is, I believe one should be able to run it as simply as `npm i && npm start` without needing to setup _\*checks notes\*_ Ruby and Java

of course, take everything I say here with a spoonful of salt since I'd definitely not be able to make this happen, not by myself at the very least...

I agree, it should be this simple

We don't have to blame anyone. They became a problem over time, not because of someone else. So it's ultimately about history and technology.

[20:39:27.0595] <Sora Morimoto>
By the way, I would love to make it better, and I think doing this with the help of the community will be a good opportunity for more people to get involved in our efforts (including the translation stuff). I will be looking for people who want to work on this in some places, do you have any blockers for that?

[20:40:36.0589] <Sora Morimoto>
I think I have enough time this month to supervise people and push this, so I'm happy to work on that!

[01:58:53.0976] <ryzokuken>
That's awesome, thanks Sora Morimoto!

[07:28:22.0975] <yulia>
hey folks

[07:28:48.0808] <yulia>
you should feel free to get in touch with me, i would be really happy for help on the website -- ive been handling it alone for over a year with only a little help on translations and reviews

[07:29:07.0703] <yulia>
regarding the choices -- we are using ruby because we could deploy it with minimal effort on github pages

[07:29:42.0970] <yulia>
we also wanted to avoid favouritism of javascript frameworks, as an endorsement could have negative consequences for people

[07:29:51.0147] <yulia>
the website is very easy to work with, you only need jekyll

[07:30:06.0691] <yulia>
I've set up several people to work on it.

[07:36:21.0450] <yulia>
Would have been really great to know that this room existed :/

[07:38:06.0971] <yulia>
Java was introduced by a contributor because they wanted to do linting -- a lot of complexity is from tooling. I very much agree with removing it

[07:38:27.0872] <yulia>
the goal i had for this site was as an on-ramp for contributors to tc39 more generally

[07:38:55.0604] <yulia>
since i have been working on it alone, even improving the contribution pipeline has been difficult. But i have a lot of ideas of what we could do to improve the site.

[07:39:22.0347] <yulia>
I don't believe anyone is actively using the docker set up, i also found it too complex in the end

[07:43:25.0670] <yulia>
 * the goal i had for this site was as an on-ramp for contributors to tc39 more generally. Having a high bar of perfectionism for everything that is added to the site is a barrier to this goal. this is why it is more permissive for contributions than what i would accept elsewhere. 

[07:43:46.0440] <yulia>
 * since i have been working on it alone, even improving the contribution pipeline has been difficult. But i have a lot of ideas of what we could do to improve the site. It would be great to have been pinged before it got announced on twitter. 

[07:43:48.0940] <Hemanth H.M>
I am trying to recall if the repo is open to public, there are few interested folks looking for contributing, also maybe we can redo the design? 

[07:44:07.0456] <yulia>
the repo is public. i have made multiple calls for contributors

[07:44:26.0402] <Hemanth H.M>
proposals.es is well done actually

[07:44:54.0436] <Hemanth H.M>
> <@yulia:mozilla.org> the repo is public. i have made multiple calls for contributors

I'll try to get in more folks

[07:44:54.0848] <yulia>
ok, what does "well done" mean precisely?

[07:45:10.0564] <yulia>
hold on, can we actually talk about the work that was done previously before tearing everything down?

[07:45:32.0355] <yulia>
we ran a survey and did a lot of internal consultation, and had an information architect work with us on the goals for this

[07:45:34.0927] <Hemanth H.M>
In terms of presentation, search functionality and surfacing the data

[07:45:48.0463] <yulia>
what are the usecases being presented today?

[07:45:53.0340] <yulia>
do we have a list?

[07:46:21.0709] <Hemanth H.M>
> <@yulia:mozilla.org> hold on, can we actually talk about the work that was done previously before tearing everything down?

Nods, hence confirmed before taking any action

[07:46:47.0657] <Hemanth H.M>
> <@yulia:mozilla.org> what are the usecases being presented today?

In that site or general?

[07:47:55.0328] <yulia>
when we did the initial analysis, we identified our most significant user base -- people who were unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the github proposals repo or identifying information that they needed. This was our targeet

[07:47:58.0838] <yulia>
has the target changed?

[07:48:41.0063] <yulia>
this is also why we only show stage 3 proposals. A lot of decisions were made very intentionally in the original design. 

[07:48:52.0218] <Hemanth H.M>
That's a good question, I feel the target remains, do we some data backing the target audience?

[07:49:20.0092] <Hemanth H.M>
> <@yulia:mozilla.org> this is also why we only show stage 3 proposals. A lot of decisions were made very intentionally in the original design. 

Ah, I recall that decision

[07:49:39.0856] <yulia>
i would have to dig, it was a few years ago

[07:50:28.0570] <yulia>
another consideration was committee time -- the website is volunteer work. maintaining it is a burden (which i voluntarily took on, but do not expect others to) -- we need to consider the value of the amount of non-automated work 

[07:51:22.0613] <yulia>
looks like the formatting of the blog post is a little broken: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/a-homepage-for-the-javascript-specification/

[07:51:41.0338] <yulia>
but this was the survey that led to the decision to make the website in the first place, and we did a lot of work shopping afterwords

[07:52:00.0047] <yulia>
so if you want to redesign -- that is absolutely fine and i welcome it. I want to make sure we ask questions about why we do it

[07:52:24.0827] <yulia>
setting it up to use the new data set : fantastic -- please someone do this it would save me an hour a month

[07:53:08.0081] <yulia>
getting rid of jekyll -- sure, we can do that. i don't consider it a barrier to entry and i am worried about moving to a js framework as it may show favouritism. 

[07:53:26.0855] <yulia>
it would be an annoying rewrite and i am not sure that it is strictly necessary

[07:54:23.0731] <yulia>
The original website is an MVP, there is a broader scope we can do here.

[07:54:51.0690] <yulia>
if we are broadening scope, lets identify which user base we want to target next and how we can benefit them. in this case, i think a rewrite is warranted.
