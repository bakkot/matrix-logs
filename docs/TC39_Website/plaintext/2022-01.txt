Quite weird. Does that still happen? Honestly, the project is not that complex/annoying as to need to use Docker, so I have never used it and have never seen the problem...

I just checked out the tc39.github.io repo, and it is _so_ cursed

why does it need a Gemfile, a Dockerfile, a Makefile and still some more? It's still a static website, right?

https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io#discussion this needs updating too fwiw

[07:12:23.0595] <Sora Morimoto>
Yes, all the classic GitHub Pages projects are cursed. Honestly, we knew somewhere that we should change this, but no one could get rid of the curse...

I mean, Jekyll is... Jekyll but why Java?

[07:14:39.0524] <ryzokuken>
You don't need Docker or Java to build a Jekyll site, right?

[07:15:40.0473] <Sora Morimoto>
It's not Java anyway (*But it's the same with Ruby...)

To be more exact, I think it would not have been too much trouble with not changing that, but it's a good opportunity to rethink this, let's do that
