> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> I'm trying to build https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io/ locally, but when I run `make install` I get this error:

Quite weird. Does that still happen? Honestly, the project is not that complex/annoying as to need to use Docker, so I have never used it and have never seen the problem...

I just checked out the tc39.github.io repo, and it is _so_ cursed

[07:08:37.0069] <ryzokuken>
why does it need a Gemfile, a Dockerfile, a Makefile and still some more? It's still a static website, right?

[07:10:37.0728] <ryzokuken>
https://github.com/tc39/tc39.github.io#discussion this needs updating too fwiw

[07:12:23.0595] <Sora Morimoto>
Yes, all the classic GitHub Pages projects are cursed. Honestly, we knew somewhere that we should change this, but no one could get rid of the curse...

I mean, Jekyll is... Jekyll but why Java?

[07:14:39.0524] <ryzokuken>
You don't need Docker or Java to build a Jekyll site, right?

[07:15:40.0473] <Sora Morimoto>
It's not Java anyway (*But it's the same with Ruby...)

[07:16:36.0681] <Sora Morimoto>
To be more exact, I think it would not have been too much trouble with not changing that, but it's a good opportunity to rethink this, let's do that

[07:27:14.0744] <ryzokuken>
let's port the website

[07:27:20.0835] <ryzokuken>
 * let's port the website

[07:27:30.0458] <ryzokuken>
to a lightweight JS generator

[07:27:32.0376] <ryzokuken>
11ty?

[07:30:23.0816] <Sora Morimoto>
I don't know which one is good as I make such a tool by myself every time. as long as no one objects to using 11ty, go with it

[07:33:05.0764] <Hemanth H.M>
11ty++

Feel free to blame me for the Dockerfile, I added that way back when. My reasoning was because there were a lot of dependencies at the time and not everyone had everything. So Docker put us all on the same level. I agree it could be much simpler. I didnâ€™t want to install Ruby on my local machine 

I didnâ€™t choose the web framework, it was already ruby when I came across it.

[09:22:34.0522] <ryzokuken>
jasew: I don't blame you at all, sorry if I came off as that. I just think the dockerfile is a sign of a deeper issue (as you mentioned in this case, hard to setup environment).

[09:23:46.0928] <ryzokuken>
Given how simple the website is, I believe one should be able to run it as simply as `npm i && npm start` without needing to setup _\*checks notes\*_ Ruby and Java

of course, take everything I say here with a spoonful of salt since I'd definitely not be able to make this happen, not by myself at the very least...

I agree, it should be this simple

We don't have to blame anyone. They became a problem over time, not because of someone else. So it's ultimately about history and technology.

[20:39:27.0595] <Sora Morimoto>
By the way, I would love to make it better, and I think doing this with the help of the community will be a good opportunity for more people to get involved in our efforts (including the translation stuff). I will be looking for people who want to work on this in some places, do you have any blockers for that?

[20:40:36.0589] <Sora Morimoto>
I think I have enough time this month to supervise people and push this, so I'm happy to work on that!

[01:58:53.0976] <ryzokuken>
That's awesome, thanks Sora Morimoto!
