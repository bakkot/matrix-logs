can we just reject his suggestion that it's called X

[09:45:06.0146] <Chris de Almeida>

Honestly now that we have a TC39 mastodon for everything, we should just lose the twitter

I don't see any reason to be an early adopter of `x`.  until there is a critical mass of websites changing their twitter references to `x`, we should not change ours

we should not lose it, as it's an unfortunate necessity to at the very least squat our brand in the major spaces.  also, unfortunately people do not cross-post their twitter content to mastodon very much.. but we should do better about nagging folks to do so
