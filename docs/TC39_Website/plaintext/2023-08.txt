can we just reject his suggestion that it's called X

[09:45:06.0146] <Chris de Almeida>
sure can

[09:45:09.0673] <ryzokuken>
Honestly now that we have a TC39 mastodon for everything, we should just lose the twitter 

[09:46:04.0199] <Chris de Almeida>
I don't see any reason to be an early adopter of `x`.  until there is a critical mass of websites changing their twitter references to `x`, we should not change ours

we should not lose it, as it's an unfortunate necessity to at the very least squat our brand in the major spaces.  also, unfortunately people do not cross-post their twitter content to mastodon very much.. but we should do better about nagging folks to do so

[09:49:15.0017] <Chris de Almeida>
and by that I mean, me nagging Rob 🙂

Sora Morimoto: related: we need to add the TC39 linkedin to the site.  do you want to take care of this?  (no pressure!)

[09:50:31.0135] <Rob Palmer>
Whilst I normally am in favour of respecting owner's wishes when it comes to the naming of projects/products, in this case, at this point in time, I think we will confuse more people than we help by being an early adopter of "x".

Let’s park it and see how some other sites do, Sora has already put in the effort of changing it and it’s not lost, we can draft that PR for now.

@Chris why do you think they will rebrand to Twitter? I find that to be unlikely, unless there’s something we don’t know.

(Also, with the proliferation of social media platforms recently, I can only convey my apologies and fatigue with replicating tweets across platforms. Each of them require subtlety different formatting and pagination. Until someone makes an app that performs high quality multi-platform posting, I'm unlikely to do it manually. 

[09:57:17.0654] <shu>
why is there a TC39 LI

[10:16:36.0612] <Chris de Almeida>
for the same reason there are TC39 mastodon and twitter accounts

[10:37:53.0908] <rkirsling>
o m n i p r e s e n c e

[11:09:48.0883] <Chris de Almeida>
the other reason, which is unique to linkedin, is that some folks like to have their association with TC39 on their linkedin profile, and it can feel clumsy/inaccurate to associate directly with Ecma International

[11:49:20.0539] <Chris de Almeida>
jasew:  the boss is a temperamental and fickle person; `x` has zero brand value, twitter has billions; they are never going to get rid of `twitter.com`;

tweet is in the dictionary.

[19:55:14.0182] <ljharb>
Also, caving to calling it X is just supporting Elon and nobody should want to do that

[19:55:17.0425] <shu>
funnily enough, so is the letter x

[19:55:54.0288] <ljharb>
lol not with a matching meaning tho :-p tweet is in the dictionary as a Twitter post specifically.

[19:56:31.0950] <ljharb>
That’s the level of brand recognition the business genius is torching

[19:56:41.0643] <shu>
you are correct sir
