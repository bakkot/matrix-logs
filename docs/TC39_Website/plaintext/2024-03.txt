Any idea?

Sora Morimoto my initial thoughts are that it's slightly preferable to use JS tools given that a vast majority of the committee and the larger ecosystem has experience with JS tools. However, I've also been a bit intrigued by biome lately so I think a PR that would port our current workflow to biome would help make a case for it.

if it actually simplifies the configuration or improves the process, I think it would be a great contender... If all it does is do the same things faster, then I guess it's harder to make a very strong case for it.
