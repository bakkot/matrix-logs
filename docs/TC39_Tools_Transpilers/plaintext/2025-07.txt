Ping for the PR above if somebody has cycles to take a look!

Very interesting initiative. What sort of review feedback are you looking for at this stage?

@room  any topics for tomorrow Agenda ? or should we postpone it after TC39 plenary?

guybedford: I think the easiest and most helpful kind of review would be "is this approach to testing the right direction / could we see these kinds of tests working for other areas as well". I assume as long as there's confidence on the shape of the tests, the runner implementation can always be changed or improved

+1 to postponing tomorrow's meeting, I don't think there's any news beyond the PR linked above from my end
