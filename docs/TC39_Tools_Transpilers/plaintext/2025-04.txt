hi 👋, I'm a new TC39 delegate, and interested in attending the next tools / transpilers meeting. I believe this is the new meeting time - TC39/JavaScript tools discussion - Wednesday, April 9⋅9:00 – 10:00am?

That's great Jan Olaf Martin ! I probably won't be able to facilitate today's meeting as I have a last-minute overlap. If you want to meet, feel free to reach out
