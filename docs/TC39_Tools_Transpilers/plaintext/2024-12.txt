Thank you for re-initiating the tooling discussions.

Regarding getting more tooling authors involved - what kind of invitation should we send out and ask around?

[09:51:54.0415] <Boshen Chen>
I'm super new to all these processes, so is still getting acquainted.

I visit time to time and onboard people to the meeting invite 

[09:52:34.0703] <Romulo Cintra>
maybe should make it more official 

[09:56:26.0302] <Boshen Chen>
Making things more official would be great! 

As a new comber to tooling, I really wished a place where I can ask around and seek for implementation alignments. Even a formal place where we could document implementation differences.

Another example: I really wish for all toolings to deprecate the `browser` field https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec
