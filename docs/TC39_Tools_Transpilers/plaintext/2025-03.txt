There is no status update on tools conventions should we skip it ?

[09:30:41.0114] <Romulo Cintra>
It might be good to cancel and convene at least week before tc39 

[09:30:51.0599] <Romulo Cintra>
so we can discuss updates and the other topic on the agenda the export defer 

[09:31:23.0120] <Romulo Cintra>
so we can also share in advance with bundlers folks to have the best audience for the topic otherwise we have to repeat it

[09:37:50.0509] <Romulo Cintra>
Moved the meeting
