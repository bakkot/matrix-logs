mpcsh: we didn't really get an answer to your question about what questions the execom has...

seems like they're going to have the meeting regardless of whether we attend or not ðŸ¤·

[08:50:43.0772] <davethegr8>
honestly it feels like they are trying to get us to jump through hoops in a way of self-validating the need for process.

[08:51:38.0533] <davethegr8>
I'm recalling earlier discussions about funding requests... it really does not seem like this is a good or effective process.

[11:19:36.0885] <ljharb>
most ecma processes fall into that bucket ime

[15:40:49.0774] <davethegr8>
ptomato mpcsh I think I have a bit more info for us, any chance we could sync up this week?

[15:42:40.0864] <ptomato>
sure, Pacific time mornings are pretty full for me for the rest of the week but afternoons should be OK

[16:02:43.0446] <davethegr8>
Tomorrow afternoon is ok for me

[16:08:14.0595] <ptomato>
I might have to duck out and let someone in the door on short notice tomorrow afternoon, but if we could schedule something soon after lunchtime?

hey all, sorry, I was OOO last week skiing volcanoes

[10:42:08.0509] <davethegr8>
Sorry I wasn't able to attend this morning. How did it go?

[12:46:14.0251] <ptomato>
I think we made some progress

[12:46:59.0765] <ptomato>
we did agree to ask the trainers for a short summary of what they thought they might cover in the training, and pass that back to the execom

[13:43:58.0633] <mpcsh>
I'm also working on a short memo with background context

[14:05:18.0720] <ljharb>
sorry i couldn't make it this morning

[14:05:26.0002] <ljharb>
what did execom need to know exactly?

[14:05:37.0733] <ljharb>
we're tc39, we provide them all their money, we want a little of it back for this, why is this hard

[15:23:57.0661] <mpcsh>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> we're tc39, we provide them all their money, we want a little of it back for this, why is this hard

they have a 40K CHF budget deficit, according to Patrick

[15:24:14.0701] <mpcsh>
I just finished drafting a short memo providing some of the missing context from the meeting https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ck_8fZWnd6uxTksQFMhsvHF-GfaQpVXx67U9QNKd4h0
