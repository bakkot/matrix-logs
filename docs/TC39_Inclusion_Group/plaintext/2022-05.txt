mpcsh: we didn't really get an answer to your question about what questions the execom has...

[08:39:56.0652] <ptomato>
seems like they're going to have the meeting regardless of whether we attend or not ü§∑

[08:50:43.0772] <davethegr8>
honestly it feels like they are trying to get us to jump through hoops in a way of self-validating the need for process.

[08:51:38.0533] <davethegr8>
I'm recalling earlier discussions about funding requests... it really does not seem like this is a good or effective process.

[11:19:36.0885] <ljharb>
most ecma processes fall into that bucket ime

[15:40:49.0774] <davethegr8>
ptomato mpcsh I think I have a bit more info for us, any chance we could sync up this week?

[15:42:40.0864] <ptomato>
sure, Pacific time mornings are pretty full for me for the rest of the week but afternoons should be OK

[16:02:43.0446] <davethegr8>
Tomorrow afternoon is ok for me

[16:08:14.0595] <ptomato>
I might have to duck out and let someone in the door on short notice tomorrow afternoon, but if we could schedule something soon after lunchtime?

[17:51:02.0539] <davethegr8>
Can we meet at 1:30pm Pacific time via https://8x8.vc/tc39/inclusion?

[19:00:19.0867] <ptomato>
works for me!

hey all, sorry, I was OOO last week skiing volcanoes

[10:42:08.0509] <davethegr8>
Sorry I wasn't able to attend this morning. How did it go?

[12:46:14.0251] <ptomato>
I think we made some progress

[12:46:59.0765] <ptomato>
we did agree to ask the trainers for a short summary of what they thought they might cover in the training, and pass that back to the execom

[13:43:58.0633] <mpcsh>
I'm also working on a short memo with background context

[14:05:18.0720] <ljharb>
sorry i couldn't make it this morning

[14:05:26.0002] <ljharb>
what did execom need to know exactly?

[14:05:37.0733] <ljharb>
we're tc39, we provide them all their money, we want a little of it back for this, why is this hard

[15:23:57.0661] <mpcsh>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> we're tc39, we provide them all their money, we want a little of it back for this, why is this hard

they have a 40K CHF budget deficit, according to Patrick

[15:24:14.0701] <mpcsh>
I just finished drafting a short memo providing some of the missing context from the meeting https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ck_8fZWnd6uxTksQFMhsvHF-GfaQpVXx67U9QNKd4h0

[15:50:54.0668] <ljharb>
> <@mpcsh_:matrix.org> they have a 40K CHF budget deficit, according to Patrick

oh ok, so are the financials being provided to all the members so we can figure out what needs to be cut?

[15:51:27.0183] <mpcsh>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> oh ok, so are the financials being provided to all the members so we can figure out what needs to be cut?

ha. haha. you're funny

[15:51:59.0208] <mpcsh>
(maybe that information is available somewhere, I don't know, but it's certainly not clear to me how a member company would influence that process in any way)

[15:52:09.0460] <davethegr8>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> oh ok, so are the financials being provided to all the members so we can figure out what needs to be cut?

ngl, I had the same thought

[15:52:38.0736] <ljharb>
i've heard some side conversations over the years about fancy dinners and parties and whatnot that are arguably unnecessary ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

bumping this for tomorrow - would love some feedback from you all üíú

[11:48:34.0380] <ptomato>
mpcsh: thanks for putting it together!

[11:48:43.0379] <ptomato>
I have a couple of minor suggestions for phrasing

[11:50:07.0867] <ptomato>
"we determined that Nonviolent Communication Training (NVC) is the best way to directly solve this problem." -> maybe "We believe that..."? I'm a bit paranoid about leaving the impression that we think the training is a one-stop solution that never has to be considered in the future

[11:52:28.0670] <ptomato>
re. the last paragraph - I do think we should include something like this, making sure it's clear that we are not just talking about a few people who "couldn't handle pressure" or something like that, but it currently reads a bit on the defensive side. I'm not sure what the best way to rephrase it is

[11:54:28.0308] <mpcsh>

I like this, thank you

this was intentional because we got some of that pushback at the end of the meeting, as you might recall

[11:55:07.0792] <mpcsh>
trying to pre-emptively shape the discourse for when we're not in the room

[11:56:06.0779] <ptomato>
I agree, but I think if skeptics pick up a defensive tone out if it, it'll be easier to dismiss

[11:56:27.0651] <mpcsh>
yeah agreed

[12:00:54.0983] <davethegr8>
"We consulted five certified NVC trainers and received tailored proposals" -> mention that we asked them to make a proposal for a customized intro to NVC style course?

[12:01:56.0608] <davethegr8>
I Think that's the only feedback I have, but I've been super busy writing emails to Directors/VPs this morning
