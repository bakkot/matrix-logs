seems like they're going to have the meeting regardless of whether we attend or not ðŸ¤·

[08:50:43.0772] <davethegr8>
honestly it feels like they are trying to get us to jump through hoops in a way of self-validating the need for process.

[08:51:38.0533] <davethegr8>
I'm recalling earlier discussions about funding requests... it really does not seem like this is a good or effective process.

[11:19:36.0885] <ljharb>
most ecma processes fall into that bucket ime

ptomato mpcsh I think I have a bit more info for us, any chance we could sync up this week?

[15:42:40.0864] <ptomato>
sure, Pacific time mornings are pretty full for me for the rest of the week but afternoons should be OK

[16:02:43.0446] <davethegr8>
Tomorrow afternoon is ok for me

[16:08:14.0595] <ptomato>
I might have to duck out and let someone in the door on short notice tomorrow afternoon, but if we could schedule something soon after lunchtime?

[19:00:19.0867] <ptomato>
