hey friends, I just wrapped up my edits on the [onboarding message](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/wiki/Onboarding-message) per discussion from our last meeting - please take a look and let me know your thoughts!

[10:31:27.0513] <ptomato>
looking great!

the only suggestion I have is to not mention the legacy listserv, just say we use Discourse as a forum
