hey friends, I just wrapped up my edits on the [onboarding message](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/wiki/Onboarding-message) per discussion from our last meeting - please take a look and let me know your thoughts!

[10:31:27.0513] <ptomato>
looking great!

[10:32:21.0680] <ptomato>
the only suggestion I have is to not mention the legacy listserv, just say we use Discourse as a forum

What is inclusion group working on? 

[09:15:00.0160] <ptomato>
today, looks like nothing 😄 the things we have in progress are improving the onboarding message that Mark linked above, and on our agenda which you can reach from https://github.com/tc39/inclusion-group/issues/33 we have been discussing making a "how to read the spec" document

[09:16:43.0461] <Jack Works>
Cool thanks! 

[09:42:50.0583] <mpcsh>

would anyone else be able to take a look at the letter ECMA needs to get NVC training submitted? I am overwhelmed with work and don't have the bandwidth. Instructions and so on should be in the github issue
