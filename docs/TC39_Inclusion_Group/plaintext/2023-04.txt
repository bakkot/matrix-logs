can someone update the room topic to reflect the correct meeting cadence and link?  Monthly on the first Thursday at 11:00 PT

(today's meeting was moved, but that's the regular slot)

[10:57:14.0391] <davethegr8>
I think we're all able to edit the room info, does it not work for you?

[10:58:35.0197] <Chris de Almeida>
I'm not an admin

[10:59:04.0050] <davethegr8>
weird, I don't think I am either

[10:59:08.0212] <Chris de Almeida>
you are ðŸ™‚

[11:22:03.0711] <Chris de Almeida>
thank you Dave!  ðŸŽ‰

[12:06:21.0322] <Chris de Almeida>
some mediocre notes I took from today's meeting.  please feel free to add

[12:06:22.0308] <Chris de Almeida>
D&I

training on our own
recruitment drive / outreach
how-we-work
education
mentors -- delegate survey

maybe add mentor to welcome letter ?

guide for presentations
-- what will people ask you about and care about?
-- performance, etc.
-- for how to prepare better to present
-- competing values that people will have

Dave Poole volunteered to brain dump his experience running mentor program previously (or currently)

how do we elevate "external" contributors to feel more like they are part of TC39 without being a delegate/IE?

IE policy review, renewal, etc

issue w/ ecma members withdrawing but then delegates become IEs
-- allows them to participate without paying to ecma

prospective (ecma) member policy

you're both admins

[06:47:31.0877] <ryzokuken>
this is so weird

[06:49:58.0343] <Chris de Almeida>
old thread.  I was made admin after this exchange

[06:50:15.0542] <ryzokuken>
oh, apologies I missed that

[06:50:17.0957] <Chris de Almeida>
> davethegr8 changed the power level of Chris de Almeida from Default to Admin.

[06:50:22.0778] <ryzokuken>
somehow element _just_ notified me of this

[06:50:33.0979] <Chris de Almeida>
the system works!

[07:00:56.0955] <ryzokuken>
btw, the permission situation seems to be a bit of a mess, but don't want to get into the way of the group's work... Let me know if you all decide to change things somewhat

[07:01:42.0861] <littledan>
Permissions for the Google meet call?

[07:01:52.0384] <ryzokuken>
no for the room

[07:02:11.0086] <ryzokuken>
I assume the idea is for all delegates/group members to have admin access

[07:14:10.0431] <Chris de Almeida>
there are some important things to note about how permissions work in matrix

[07:14:23.0940] <Chris de Almeida>
mostly a concern for the big channels (delegates/general)

[07:14:47.0383] <Chris de Almeida>
but, for example admins are forever -- they would need to reduce their own level, nobody else can do it
