can someone update the room topic to reflect the correct meeting cadence and link?  Monthly on the first Thursday at 11:00 PT

(today's meeting was moved, but that's the regular slot)

I think we're all able to edit the room info, does it not work for you?

I'm not an admin

[10:59:08.0212] <Chris de Almeida>
you are ðŸ™‚

[11:22:03.0711] <Chris de Almeida>
thank you Dave!  ðŸŽ‰

some mediocre notes I took from today's meeting.  please feel free to add

D&I

training on our own
recruitment drive / outreach
how-we-work
education
mentors -- delegate survey

maybe add mentor to welcome letter ?

guide for presentations
-- what will people ask you about and care about?
-- performance, etc.
-- for how to prepare better to present
-- competing values that people will have

Dave Poole volunteered to brain dump his experience running mentor program previously (or currently)

how do we elevate "external" contributors to feel more like they are part of TC39 without being a delegate/IE?

IE policy review, renewal, etc

issue w/ ecma members withdrawing but then delegates become IEs
-- allows them to participate without paying to ecma

prospective (ecma) member policy
