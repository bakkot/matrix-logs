@room I've created a doodle to reschedule our calls, polling for the month of march. please select times that work for you on a monthly basis. I'll schedule the call as the nth weekday of the month (rather than the nth date) for consistency's sake. please respond this week, I'll send out an invite next week. thanks! https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/aMZxkPRb

ryzokuken: I'm sorry that there aren't better options for your timezone, US <-> EU is brutal ðŸ˜ž

[14:22:13.0774] <Chris de Almeida>
any reason why the 24th is excluded?

oops, no, that's a mistake

[14:34:49.0877] <mpcsh>
Chris de Almeida, davethegr8: I just added the 24th, since you two already responded you'll have to edit your responses

[14:45:49.0185] <littledan>
115 options?? How did you fill this out?

[15:43:48.0825] <Chris de Almeida>
wrote a script to automate

[16:05:04.0099] <davethegr8>
lots of clicks

[06:25:43.0548] <littledan>
OK I'll fill this out if there's a doodle with O(5-10) options; otherwise, I'll leave the scheduling of this to the rest of you and attend if I can.

[09:00:25.0212] <ptomato>
I'm scared to click on it now ðŸ˜…

oh, sorry! I honestly hadn't thought of filling it out manually â€” I link my calendars to doodle and it auto-selects my availability. littledan & ptomato, do any of the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd thursdays at 11am PT / 2pm ET work for you?
