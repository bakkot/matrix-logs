@room I've created a doodle to reschedule our calls, polling for the month of march. please select times that work for you on a monthly basis. I'll schedule the call as the nth weekday of the month (rather than the nth date) for consistency's sake. please respond this week, I'll send out an invite next week. thanks! https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/aMZxkPRb
