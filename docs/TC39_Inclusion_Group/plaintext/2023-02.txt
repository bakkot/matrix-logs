@room I've created a doodle to reschedule our calls, polling for the month of march. please select times that work for you on a monthly basis. I'll schedule the call as the nth weekday of the month (rather than the nth date) for consistency's sake. please respond this week, I'll send out an invite next week. thanks! https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/aMZxkPRb

ryzokuken: I'm sorry that there aren't better options for your timezone, US <-> EU is brutal 😞

[14:22:13.0774] <Chris de Almeida>
any reason why the 24th is excluded?

It's okay! Thanks for being mindful about it 💜

oops, no, that's a mistake

[14:34:49.0877] <mpcsh>
Chris de Almeida, davethegr8: I just added the 24th, since you two already responded you'll have to edit your responses

[14:45:49.0185] <littledan>
115 options?? How did you fill this out?

[15:43:48.0825] <Chris de Almeida>
wrote a script to automate


2023-02-15
[16:05:04.0099] <davethegr8>
lots of clicks

[06:25:43.0548] <littledan>
OK I'll fill this out if there's a doodle with O(5-10) options; otherwise, I'll leave the scheduling of this to the rest of you and attend if I can.

[09:00:25.0212] <ptomato>
I'm scared to click on it now 😅

[01:32:01.0311] <mpcsh>
oh, sorry! I honestly hadn't thought of filling it out manually — I link my calendars to doodle and it auto-selects my availability. littledan & ptomato, do any of the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd thursdays at 11am PT / 2pm ET work for you?

[03:54:01.0046] <littledan>
Ah yeah I can’t do that with my calendar. That is a great solution when possible. Generally yeah 2 PM ET is a free slot for me—all of those work.

anyone meeting today?

[09:04:04.0239] <Chris de Almeida>
I can meet in a bit, but I thought the old meeting times were scrapped

[09:24:30.0124] <davethegr8>
I still had it on my calendar, so wasn't sure. thanks Chris!

alright! @room I've sent out the new invite: monthly at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 8pm CET on the first thursday. please let me know if you were expecting an invite and didn't receive one, or if you'd like the invite to go to a different email address.

mpcsh: do you have write access to the TC39 calendar to add this event?

[09:09:18.0117] <ljharb>
i can do that, just DM me the list of invitee email addresses


2023-02-23
[09:20:14.0765] <yulia>
I can just give you access -- but you can also invite the calendar to the event. it will auto accept and show up

[09:20:46.0985] <davethegr8>

That's great to know, thanks yulia !

[09:23:20.0772] <yulia>
this is how you do it: 

[11:21:04.0334] <ljharb>
altho if the event is created by someone with their employer account, and then they leave that employer, it kills the event - so it's better if the event is directly created on the calendar :-)

[13:47:06.0790] <mpcsh>
> <@davethegr8:matrix.org> mpcsh: do you have write access to the TC39 calendar to add this event?

sorry I didn't see this till now — I do have write access, the invite I sent was from the TC39 calendar 👍🏻

[14:20:52.0622] <davethegr8>
Somehow it wasn't showing up. Odd.
