Excellent news: Bloomberg is happy to sponsor a couple hours of stenography at the upcoming TC39 meeting, if we can find a vendor in time, as a trial

[06:15:50.0509] <littledan>
mpcsh: Do you have any leads there?

[09:03:27.0464] <Chris de Almeida>
meeting?

[09:10:25.0101] <Richard Gibson>
belated regrets for missing again today

[09:31:34.0033] <davethegr8>
had to drop, great to meet you Chris de Almeida 

[09:50:35.0746] <mpcsh>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> mpcsh: Do you have any leads there?

woohoo! not yet, but I can furnish some for you.

sorry all for missing the meeting — I've had a medical not-quite-crisis over the last few days and have been dealing with that. I'm getting our presentations on the agenda now (10min to the deadline! woof!) and I'll be on the ball next week.

NVC and stenography should be discussion items, not breakout sessions, don’t you think?

When an employee of a TC39 member (who has never acted as a delegate before) says that TC39 doesn’t do a good job of inclusivity (e.g., for women, for differing perspectives), then is there a person or place to whom I can point them to discuss their concerns? There’s no webpage for the Inclusion Group or whatever—the closest thing I can find is the CoC page.

[06:48:45.0899] <littledan>
jschoi: You can join the inclusion group matrix chat, #tc39-inclusion:matrix.org 

[06:49:11.0762] <littledan>
or they can file a CoC report if there's something concrete, too

[06:49:17.0480] <jschoi>
Apologies and thanks!

[06:49:37.0325] <jschoi>
Wait, I got confused.

[06:49:58.0689] <jschoi>
This *is* the inclusion group Matrix chat, haha. So you’re saying “join the chat” is what I tell them.

[06:54:36.0134] <littledan>
oh wow I got confused!!!

[06:54:42.0137] <littledan>
yes... join this chat

[06:54:43.0668] <littledan>
sorry

[06:55:04.0770] <littledan>
yeah I think this is a good way to get in touch, don't you think?

[07:27:40.0325] <jschoi>
Yeah. I think eventually there should be a webpage devoted to the Inclusion Group that we could simply point to when someone airs concerns like this.

[07:27:50.0257] <jschoi>
 * Yeah. I think eventually there should be a webpage devoted to the Inclusion Group that we could simply point to when someone airs concerns like this.

(Is it okay to publicly point to this room’s Matrix address?)

[07:28:02.0419] <littledan>
well, this group wasn't chartered by the committee; it's just something that I said we should do, and people went with it

[07:28:06.0079] <jschoi>
 * (Is it okay to publicly point to this room’s Matrix address?)

[07:28:23.0026] <littledan>
I'm not sure what the website should say

[07:29:30.0461] <jschoi>
We probably should have it formally chartered too. It’s an important issue.
(The webpage would probably say, “Join us at [link to Matrix room]. [Learn how to use Matrix here].”)

[07:30:14.0639] <littledan>
yeah, seems reasonable. It would be nice to have a publicly accessible way to learn about lots of TC39 subgroups

[07:31:07.0789] <jschoi>
In any case, it’s okay to publicly point to the #tc39-inclusion:matrix.org address, right?

[07:31:13.0905] <littledan>
yes

Do we have any progress on the NVC or stenography topics?

[07:58:17.0632] <littledan>
has anyone gotten in touch with vendors? do I need to do this?

[07:58:22.0025] <littledan>
mpcsh: Chris de Almeida ^

[07:58:32.0983] <littledan>
do we want to move these topics to not be considered "breakouts"?

[10:12:52.0344] <littledan>
mpcsh suggested steno.com; I called them and they said that they can't work outside of legal cases

[10:28:35.0484] <littledan>
I got in touch with the folks at https://broadcastcc.com/ and they seemed like a great fit

[10:28:57.0230] <littledan>
They are available during TC39 and the price is $135/hour, which is within the budget that Bloomberg is happy to sponsor for a couple hours

[10:29:09.0378] <littledan>
I talked through the Google Docs workflow and they were up for it

[10:29:24.0337] <littledan>

[10:30:23.0034] <littledan>
How about we try this on Wednesday, July 20th, from 10 AM to noon?

[10:32:24.0224] <littledan>
We would just need to have a short agenda item to introduce the topic, and get everyone's consent for being transcribed in this way

[10:32:49.0363] <littledan>
would people be OK with that? especially chairs, yulia Rob Palmer ryzokuken 

[10:35:19.0367] <yulia>
oh, wow thats neat 

[11:01:38.0595] <Chris de Almeida>
littledan: @christianulbrich:matrix.org contacted `White Coat Captioning`, yesterday, which was suggested in the reflector issue and had done tech confs before.  still waiting on response AFAIK, but I can reach out to him to check.  or if we are definitely going with `IR Broadcast Captioning` we can put the brakes on the conversation with `White Coat Captioning`

[11:03:02.0237] <littledan>
yes, I contacted them as well before seeing that message. I also tried calling them and they didn't pick up

[11:03:23.0399] <littledan>
Christian said that he'd update the thread when he got in touch, and he didn't update

[11:03:42.0151] <littledan>
this whole thing is coming up very soon, so I'm inclined to try broadcastcc.com unless someone sees issues with it

[11:04:25.0008] <littledan>
I expect them to get back with an email summarizing our conversation, which I will post to the Reflector
