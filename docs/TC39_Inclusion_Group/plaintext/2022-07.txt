Excellent news: Bloomberg is happy to sponsor a couple hours of stenography at the upcoming TC39 meeting, if we can find a vendor in time, as a trial

[06:15:50.0509] <littledan>
mpcsh: Do you have any leads there?

[09:03:27.0464] <Chris de Almeida>
meeting?

[09:10:25.0101] <Richard Gibson>
belated regrets for missing again today

[09:31:34.0033] <davethegr8>
had to drop, great to meet you Chris de Almeida

woohoo! not yet, but I can furnish some for you.

sorry all for missing the meeting — I've had a medical not-quite-crisis over the last few days and have been dealing with that. I'm getting our presentations on the agenda now (10min to the deadline! woof!) and I'll be on the ball next week.

NVC and stenography should be discussion items, not breakout sessions, don’t you think?

When an employee of a TC39 member (who has never acted as a delegate before) says that TC39 doesn’t do a good job of inclusivity (e.g., for women, for differing perspectives), then is there a person or place to whom I can point them to discuss their concerns? There’s no webpage for the Inclusion Group or whatever—the closest thing I can find is the CoC page.

[06:48:45.0899] <littledan>
jschoi: You can join the inclusion group matrix chat, #tc39-inclusion:matrix.org 

[06:49:11.0762] <littledan>
or they can file a CoC report if there's something concrete, too

[06:49:17.0480] <jschoi>
Apologies and thanks!

[06:49:37.0325] <jschoi>
Wait, I got confused.

[06:49:58.0689] <jschoi>
This *is* the inclusion group Matrix chat, haha. So you’re saying “join the chat” is what I tell them.

[06:54:36.0134] <littledan>
oh wow I got confused!!!

[06:54:42.0137] <littledan>
yes... join this chat

[06:54:43.0668] <littledan>
sorry

[06:55:04.0770] <littledan>
yeah I think this is a good way to get in touch, don't you think?

[07:27:40.0325] <jschoi>
Yeah. I think eventually there should be a webpage devoted to the Inclusion Group that we could simply point to when someone airs concerns like this.

[07:27:50.0257] <jschoi>

(Is it okay to publicly point to this room’s Matrix address?)

[07:28:02.0419] <littledan>
well, this group wasn't chartered by the committee; it's just something that I said we should do, and people went with it

[07:28:23.0026] <littledan>
I'm not sure what the website should say

[07:29:30.0461] <jschoi>
We probably should have it formally chartered too. It’s an important issue.
(The webpage would probably say, “Join us at [link to Matrix room]. [Learn how to use Matrix here].”)
