looking forward to seeing everyone in ~12h! let's plan to discuss the NVC funding request and anything else on our minds :)

I might not be able to make it, depending on if another meeting ends timely or not

I'm a bit late, but ready now

agh sorry y'all, severely overslept. I guess this is what I get for trying to push it too hard ðŸ˜ž

hi all! I came to the meeting today after missing a few of the previous ones - we thought that maybe scheduling it at a different time would make it easier to attend

[10:10:15.0368] <ptomato>
for me, this time is fine, just bad luck with other things being scheduled over it recently, but it seems like this time might not be the best for several other folks - I'd be happy to start a doodle to pick a new time

[10:10:17.0909] <ptomato>
what do you think?

I haven't been able to attend lately due to many things going on :(
