hey all â€” I'm at an onsite this week and can't join our usual call. any opposition to punting to next week?

[21:04:23.0095] <mpcsh>
(if none by tomorrow EOD I'll reschedule)

oof, I'm so sorry folks but I just had an unavoidable conflict dropped on me and won't be able to make it tomorrow. up to y'all whether to meet or punt again.
