Sorry that I haven't been attending; I have a standing conflict at the exact time of the meeting

[10:24:20.0250] <ryzokuken>
it also conflicts with the chairs meeting slot so it'll be nice to reschedule if folks are in favor

[14:02:59.0603] <davethegr8>
I'm up for a different timeslot, whatever works for others
