Sorry that I haven't been attending; I have a standing conflict at the exact time of the meeting

[10:24:20.0250] <ryzokuken>
it also conflicts with the chairs meeting slot so it'll be nice to reschedule if folks are in favor

[14:02:59.0603] <davethegr8>
I'm up for a different timeslot, whatever works for others

I'm happy to reschedule! I'd propose that we move to a monthly call. @room, can you please ➕ this message if you'd like an invite, and reply with your timezone(s)? once I have that info I'll put a poll together to select a time.

I’m in NY time, but contended in my mornings 

[17:28:59.0353] <mpcsh>
does that mean you have low availability in the mornings? I've never heard "contend" used in that way 🤔

[17:47:09.0326] <littledan>
Low availability, yes

[17:47:25.0638] <littledan>
Contended in the sense of parallel resource usage!

[21:24:31.0347] <mpcsh>
I'll let that thread ☝️ run until next monday, then send out a poll for a new time.
