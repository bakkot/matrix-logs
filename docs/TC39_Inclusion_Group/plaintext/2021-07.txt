I realized I will not be able to make the meeting today, sorry! if you do discuss facilitating a newcomers event at next week's plenary, then I may have some time to help

[09:00:51.0349] <ryzokuken>
I'm joining 

[09:04:19.0216] <davethegr8>
Anyone else coming?

[09:05:50.0861] <ryzokuken>
mpcsh: jasew ?

[09:08:27.0407] <jasew>
I canâ€™t make it today sorry 

[09:09:16.0855] <ryzokuken>
no worries

[09:09:58.0688] <littledan>
Yeah sorry we should probably move an Igalia-internal meeting to avoid this standing conflict that Philip and I have

[09:10:45.0062] <ryzokuken>
ah, that should do it! 

[09:23:18.0293] <ptomato>
I am actually done now, so I can join if you're still there

[09:23:53.0178] <ptomato>
(empty, so I guess it's done already ðŸ˜ƒ)

[09:24:04.0675] <ryzokuken>

[13:32:34.0388] <mpcsh>

hey friends, I will be sadly unable to attend our call tomorrow - my grandmother just passed away and I'm taking some bereavement time. ðŸ’œ

[08:15:12.0888] <jasew>
Sorry to hear that @mpsch I also wonâ€™t be able to make it so I wonder if we should cancel this week?

[08:44:03.0889] <ptomato>
sorry to hear about that!

[08:44:23.0589] <ptomato>
my condolences to you and your family
