Just found out that my own grandfather passed away, so I won't be attending tomorrow either. :(

oh, I'm so sorry, Dave - heartfelt condolences!

[16:21:04.0463] <littledan>
So sorry to hear from all of you! I think I will have to call my surviving grandparents tomorrow; I am getting scared.

I won't be able to make it today, we have a global all hands

[09:06:07.0140] <littledan>
Yeah, I will be saying farewell to this group for a while. I hope you all advance well towards your goals!

[09:10:21.0157] <mpcsh>
Richard and I hopped on the call for a few moments but there wasn't anything important that the two of us could discuss on our own. see you all at the next one :)

[09:10:44.0539] <mpcsh>

I thought it would be a good space for folks who are not good at English to have channels to discuss proposals in a specific language, such as TC39 Japanese. What do you think about that? I can be a moderator for some languages (limited to what I can understand!) if necessary ðŸ™ƒ

[05:20:47.0678] <jschoi>
I think it would be cool, but I wonder about how the CoC Committee would handle conduct reports if theyâ€™re not in English. 

[07:41:15.0778] <ljharb>
the JSCIG has a space for discussing proposals in Chinese; Iâ€™ve tried to follow along using Google translate and to comment in English when i have responses. Iâ€™m not sure how helpful itâ€™s been as a discussion medium.

[07:43:02.0307] <ljharb>
given that the spec itself, and all the plenary notes, are in English and likely to remain so, could there be an issue with having sufficient context for those who canâ€™t understand that source material?

[08:59:25.0789] <davethegr8>
We've had a few discussions about non-english channels. There weren't too many concerns, the biggest being translations for CoC reasons afaik. I think there would be a lot of positives, it just needs someone to step forward and take lead.

Yes. It seems like you get the correct translation from Google. 

[09:40:44.0738] <ljharb>
Awesome, Iâ€™m glad to hear that

I have no doubt to agree with this. I think we can set up some kind of trial period and stop this initiative if it does not work very well.

We have a plan for this, but unfortunately it is blocked on me.

[06:34:36.0272] <ryzokuken>
I plan to reach out to the different delegates and IEs who helped us out with translations so far if they'd be interested in running these channels.

[06:35:23.0273] <ryzokuken>
Basically, the idea was that we could have chatrooms (and discourse) in a certain language if there is atleast one delegate willing to act as a moderator.

[06:35:37.0272] <ryzokuken>
I've not run this through the CoC folks yet so I'm not sure if that will work

[06:36:35.0366] <davethegr8>
Also reminder we have a call tomorrow at 9am pacific time. ;) to discuss this or anything else on peopleâ€™s minds. 

[06:39:53.0903] <Sora Morimoto>
Excellent - I appreciate your efforts for this

Hello friends. If y'all ever felt so inclined to take a look at the welcome email we send and add your IG polish, I wouldn't say no. It's dated and lacks new info and also lacks any explanation of the TLA which isn't great. Currently there's five sectionsâ€”welcome, github, matrix, discourse, closing. i have a version of each of the middle sections for when we do and do not already have people's usernames.

[10:44:51.0140] <Aki>
you can find what is functionally the most recent version here https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/wiki/Onboarding-message

[10:45:19.0988] <ryzokuken>
Awesome, more stuff on the agenda tomorrow! 

[10:46:32.0759] <Aki>
hahahaha no obligation

[10:46:54.0599] <Aki>
i was just looking at it yesterday and bemoaning the fact that i wrote it like 3 years ago and haven't really edited since

[11:24:04.0796] <mpcsh>
yeah, that'll be great to discuss tomorrow!
