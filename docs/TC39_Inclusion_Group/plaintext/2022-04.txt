sorry, forgot to post that I'll be unavailable tomorrow morning. will post a status update later on in the day

I'll be missing as well due to a conflicting appointment

[06:45:34.0756] <ryzokuken>
can we reschedule the meeting? it directly conflicts with the chairs' meeting too so it's virtually impossible to attend for me
