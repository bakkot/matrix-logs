sorry, forgot to post that I'll be unavailable tomorrow morning. will post a status update later on in the day

[06:44:51.0957] <Richard Gibson>
I'll be missing as well due to a conflicting appointment

[06:45:34.0756] <ryzokuken>
can we reschedule the meeting? it directly conflicts with the chairs' meeting too so it's virtually impossible to attend for me

[08:58:27.0733] <Rob Palmer>
hello Inclusion Group, do you have an email address I can reference?

[08:58:47.0024] <Rob Palmer>
I am updating the NVC funding request and wish to attach a single point of contact for this group

[08:59:20.0872] <davethegr8>
afaik we do not have a single email

[09:00:04.0590] <Rob Palmer>
Is there a lead person who would like to take this?

[09:00:18.0768] <Rob Palmer>
Otherwise I'll just give the TC39 chairs' email address.

[09:02:02.0343] <Rob Palmer>
I have updated the letter with the following on the advice from Istvan:

>We expect to the attendee count to be similar to normal plenary numbers, meaning approximately 40-60 TC39 delegates would participate in these sessions.  In order to get maximal benefit from this investment, TC39 would also be willing to advertise these sessions as being open to participants from other Ecma TCs.

These workshops are _highly_ interactive, adding an unknown number of additional participants would mean that the trainers need to bring more staff, which would increase cost
