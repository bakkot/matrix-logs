sorry, forgot to post that I'll be unavailable tomorrow morning. will post a status update later on in the day

[06:44:51.0957] <Richard Gibson>
I'll be missing as well due to a conflicting appointment

[06:45:34.0756] <ryzokuken>
can we reschedule the meeting? it directly conflicts with the chairs' meeting too so it's virtually impossible to attend for me

[08:58:27.0733] <Rob Palmer>
hello Inclusion Group, do you have an email address I can reference?

[08:58:47.0024] <Rob Palmer>
I am updating the NVC funding request and wish to attach a single point of contact for this group

[08:59:20.0872] <davethegr8>
afaik we do not have a single email

[09:00:04.0590] <Rob Palmer>
Is there a lead person who would like to take this?

[09:00:18.0768] <Rob Palmer>
Otherwise I'll just give the TC39 chairs' email address.

[09:02:02.0343] <Rob Palmer>
I have updated the letter with the following on the advice from Istvan:

>We expect to the attendee count to be similar to normal plenary numbers, meaning approximately 40-60 TC39 delegates would participate in these sessions.  In order to get maximal benefit from this investment, TC39 would also be willing to advertise these sessions as being open to participants from other Ecma TCs.

[09:09:26.0364] <davethegr8>
These workshops are _highly_ interactive, adding an unknown number of additional participants would mean that the trainers need to bring more staff, which would increase cost

[09:10:53.0387] <Rob Palmer>
In practice I do not think there would be many folk extra attend.  TC39 is the largest committee by far AFAICT.

[09:11:06.0328] <Rob Palmer>
So this is to soften Ecma's decision.

[09:11:15.0101] <Rob Palmer>
Just to check, these workshops run over Zoom right?

[09:11:32.0138] <davethegr8>
They were scoped for online, yeah.

[09:11:38.0559] <Rob Palmer>
good - that is safest

[09:12:21.0255] <Rob Palmer>
Are you happy with the number 40-60?  I am just blanket assuming everyone who attends plenary would attend this.

[09:12:43.0045] <davethegr8>
Let me check, one second.

[09:13:25.0209] <Rob Palmer>
Realistically I could imagine many delegates opting out.  Whilst some folk will be genuinely curious, we are relying on inertia to some extent.

[09:14:03.0781] <Rob Palmer>
But for the purposes of justifying the cost to Ecma, I think we are more likely to succeed by assuming we shall have a full turnout.

[09:15:38.0014] <davethegr8>
In my conversations with Kathy, I quoted up to 80 participants. So 40-60 + some number of other Ecma delegates should be fine.

[09:15:50.0620] <Rob Palmer>
I think we are very safe then.

[09:16:07.0197] <davethegr8>
Agreed!

[09:16:53.0080] <davethegr8>
Probably be the best POC for questions is mpcsh - I've been overwhelmed at my day job for the last 6 months and haven't been able to do anything here. Should have them confirm tho

[09:20:33.0312] <Rob Palmer>
I'll just list chairs.  I need to get this letter out today because ExeCom is next week.

[15:26:36.0755] <ptomato>
> <@pchimento:igalia.com> for me, this time is fine, just bad luck with other things being scheduled over it recently, but it seems like this time might not be the best for several other folks - I'd be happy to start a doodle to pick a new time

sounds like I should definitely start a doodle to pick a new time ðŸ˜… I'll send one out sometime next week

thanks davethegr8 for fielding those questions! yeah so the update I never got around to on friday was that I had received communications from Rob and Istvan on the proposal and it's moving forward. I'll keep this channel in the loop as it develops further.

AP for Inclusion Group: provide more documentation for ECMA ExeCom and ECMA GA to review

[07:46:27.0647] <ryzokuken>
perhaps a programme/agenda of sorts?
