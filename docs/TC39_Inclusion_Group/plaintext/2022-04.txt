sorry, forgot to post that I'll be unavailable tomorrow morning. will post a status update later on in the day

[06:44:51.0957] <Richard Gibson>
I'll be missing as well due to a conflicting appointment

[06:45:34.0756] <ryzokuken>
can we reschedule the meeting? it directly conflicts with the chairs' meeting too so it's virtually impossible to attend for me

hello Inclusion Group, do you have an email address I can reference?

[08:58:47.0024] <Rob Palmer>
I am updating the NVC funding request and wish to attach a single point of contact for this group

[08:59:20.0872] <davethegr8>
afaik we do not have a single email

[09:00:04.0590] <Rob Palmer>
Is there a lead person who would like to take this?
