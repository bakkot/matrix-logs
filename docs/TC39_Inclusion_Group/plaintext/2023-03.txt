first meeting on the new schedule in about 12 hours! thread your agenda items here

[09:37:41.0875] <Chris de Almeida>
NVC training update?

[10:55:28.0381] <mpcsh>
ah lol I didn't hit send on my reply last night â€” that was my one item as well

[11:01:48.0116] <ptomato>
sorry, I can't make it today

[11:33:29.0078] <mpcsh>
recap:
- unfortunately, for various administrative & personal-capacity reasons, we've likely missed the train with NVC training.
- action item for next meeting: reflect on communication problems & phenomena that we observe during the course of committee work
- agenda for next meeting: share & discuss those items, brainstorm lower-friction alternatives to NVC training

[11:35:13.0071] <mpcsh>
also: dates aren't firm yet, but I will likely be deep in the cascade mountains on an expedition during the next meeting (april 6). I'll reschedule for the thursday prior (march 30, same time) if need be, and if there are no objections.

hmm, I like that title

[10:16:28.0187] <littledan>
but the S word is on that site!

[10:21:06.0319] <Chris de Almeida>
wait, the what word?

[10:21:56.0655] <Chris de Almeida>
ohhh

[10:22:31.0094] <Chris de Almeida>
different context though -- critically

[10:34:25.0266] <Chris de Almeida>
alright, so for the folks who weren't at our meeting yesterday, one of the concerns/objections raised about the NVC training was the connection to 'spirituality'.

objection to the training on those grounds is totally valid.  moreover, I would be surprised if there was a plurality of folks who would support the training if there was a religious component to it.

AFAICT, they (NVC and its minions) define spirituality in very loose terms -- namely, referring just to life and human relationships, and there is nothing about spirituality/religious influence substantively in the book.  it does talk about NVC as a way to resolve conflict amongst people living closely and observing disparate religions.

so, I think NVC is still viable, but only if we can get assurance (and assure our colleagues) that there is no religious angle

[10:36:13.0350] <Chris de Almeida>
I think it would go a long way if we could get someone who does these trainings to speak/present at plenary and answer questions

[13:19:19.0780] <littledan>
yeah, if someone wants to take on bringing a trainer or at least a more detailed curriculum around communication training to plenary, the March meeting is your chance--this is the deadline set last fall, when the ExeCom was discussing the non-engagement from this group about the previous action items that we were given in the June 2022 GA meeting. The actions were to bring a more detailed explanation of what the course is, and to get broad buy-in from committee on this (2/3 majority, at least; not asking for full consensus)

[13:19:57.0202] <littledan>
[As mentioned above, due to many personal capacity issues--which I share!--we each dropped the ball on this previously. If someone wants to pick it up, now is the time.]

[13:51:28.0632] <Chris de Almeida>
ok so this got a direct response -- which I think we all forgot about?

[13:51:54.0317] <littledan>
this is an answer to the spirituality part but it doesn't walk through the curriculum in more detail

[13:52:03.0027] <Chris de Almeida>
right

[13:52:08.0648] <littledan>
the request from ExeCom was not about spirituality

[13:52:16.0322] <Chris de Almeida>
yeah I wasn't referring to that

[13:52:20.0175] <littledan>
ah OK

[13:52:51.0254] <Chris de Almeida>
but that part was throwing me off because it's a potential showstopper.  

[13:53:22.0205] <littledan>
I see
