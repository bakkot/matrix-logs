[09:37:41.0875] <Chris de Almeida>
NVC training update?

[10:55:28.0381] <mpcsh>
ah lol I didn't hit send on my reply last night â€” that was my one item as well

[11:01:48.0116] <ptomato>
sorry, I can't make it today

[11:33:29.0078] <mpcsh>
recap:
- unfortunately, for various administrative & personal-capacity reasons, we've likely missed the train with NVC training.
- action item for next meeting: reflect on communication problems & phenomena that we observe during the course of committee work
- agenda for next meeting: share & discuss those items, brainstorm lower-friction alternatives to NVC training

also: dates aren't firm yet, but I will likely be deep in the cascade mountains on an expedition during the next meeting (april 6). I'll reschedule for the thursday prior (march 30, same time) if need be, and if there are no objections.
