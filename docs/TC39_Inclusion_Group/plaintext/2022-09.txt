> <@littledan:matrix.org> reminder: NVC will not proceed without a presentation to plenary to meet the requirements noted last meeting. Is anyone going to take this on?

hi, yes. everything TC39 has taken a back seat to life this summer, but I would like to finally make this presentation.

[02:42:48.0096] <mpcsh>
I will not be available at our usual time tomorrow morning, unfortunately

[02:43:33.0166] <littledan>
The request, which I think is reasonable, is to:
- Present the syllabus in a bit more detail
- Explain why we need this (in particular, we should correct the misunderstanding that this is *only* to protect new people from long-time people, when it's really to help everybody)
- Do a temperature check and get at least 2/3 support from the committee

[02:44:10.0972] <littledan>
mpcsh: If you're too busy, can you share the contact information with the selected trainers so that someone else can get in touch with them to request this more detailed curriculum?

[06:16:15.0104] <davethegr8>
littledan: contact info is alongside the proposal docs in GitHub- I think the admin and business issue

[06:16:27.0139] <littledan>
ah oops

[06:16:43.0656] <littledan>
OK, well, should I contact them, or will someone else take this item of getting their syllabus

[08:39:09.0392] <Richard Gibson>
I am on vacation this week and will miss today's meeting 

[08:47:37.0713] <littledan>
I have a conflicting meeting so I'll miss this one; if you can just decide whether someone will take on this task, it would be good; let me know if I should do it as a fallback.

Did anyone take on the action item of reaching out to the NVC trainers to get their syllabus?

[17:41:25.0121] <davethegr8>
I did not, guessing no one else did either 

[02:20:22.0523] <littledan>
I guess by "take on" I mean more like, does anyone plan to do it

👋 hi friends! I'm severely overcommitted — realistically, I have been for a while — and I haven't been able to show up for you properly because of it. rather than continuing to let things hang over my head, I'm going to step away from much of my TC39 work for the coming quarter, and re-evaluate in the new year. godspeed and I'll see you all soon!
