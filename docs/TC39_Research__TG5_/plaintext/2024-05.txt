https://github.com/gesa/tc39-notes/blob/mtg-101st/meetings/2024-04/april-08.md#tg5-experiments-in-programming-language-standardization says "In terms of cadence, we plan to have meetings on the last Wednesday of every month."

meeting starts in about 90min, right?

[06:35:25.0802] <Mikhail Barash>
The meeting will start in 25 minutes

[06:36:25.0535] <jmdyck>
Hm, I think https://github.com/tc39/tg5?tab=readme-ov-file#last-wednesday-of-every-month-alternating needs to be updated then

Indeed, the previous slot A meeting was held on 29th March, when the US has already switched to the summer time (on the 10th of March), but Europe hasn't (Europe switched on the 31st of March), so the time difference back then was different by 1 hour than now...

could it be posted in a non-private place? (https://github.com/tc39/tg5?tab=readme-ov-file#agenda says agendas are to be posted in `/agendas`, but that folder doesn't appear to exist yet.

we'll discuss publishing of the notes at today's meeting, and then will be posting agendas and notes on TG5's GitHub

nm, I re-found the agenda in the "TG5 Notes" google doc
