We have to cancel next week's TG5 meeting (Wednesday 27.11.2024), as both Yulia and I will participate in https://conf.researchr.org/track/bldl-15/bldl-15-papers#About

Notes weren't taken during the TG5 Workshop at Uni Tokyo. Notes are taken during the TG5 monthly meetings, but during the TG5 Workshops - only for "technical discussion" sessions (and in Tokyo we only had presentations, not "technical discussions")
