yes, it is much further along and was presented at today's wasm CG meeting

[10:36:32.0265] <Michael Ficarra>
the plan is to adopt it at June's in-person wasm CG meeting

Yes, it’s tomorrow 24th of April at 10:00 CEST 

[07:37:58.0443] <jmdyck>
Don't think I'll be awake for that.

[07:39:46.0637] <Mikhail Barash>
The meeting tomorrow is “time slot B” mirroring of the March meeting

[07:41:13.0223] <Jesse>
ah, I see it now -- thanks!

What is "natural programming"?

[07:28:52.0790] <Chris de Almeida>
> <@jmdyck:matrix.org> What is "natural programming"?

It is in this context that we developed the Natural Programming design process, that treats usability as a first-class objective by following these steps:

- Identify the target audience and the domain, that is, the group of people who will be using the system and the kinds of problems they will be working on.

- Understand the target audience, by studying the actual language, techniques, and thinking they naturally use when trying to solve problems. This includes an awareness of general HCI principles as well as prior work in the psychology of programming and empirical studies. When issues or questions arise that are not answered by the prior work, conduct new user studies to examine them.

- Design the new system based on this information.

- Evaluate the system to measure its success, and to understand any new problems the users have. Redesign the system based on this evaluation, and then reevaluate it, following the standard HCI principle of iterative design.

Thus, the Natural Programming approach is an application of the standard user-centered design process to the specific domain of programming languages and environments.
