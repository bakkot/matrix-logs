[08:16:46.0692] <Jesse>
I also work on formalization; it's a pleasure to meet fellow enthusiasts

[08:16:54.0480] <Jesse>
especially those who can bring counterexamples to the table

When I joined the meeting, it said that the meeting was being transcribed. Is the transcription accessible somewhere?

[16:18:09.0865] <Michael Ficarra>
I think this tool they used to confirm faithful line-by-line mechanisation went under the radar today: https://systemf.epfl.ch/blog/SpecMerger/

It's checking that the *comments* in the mechanization match the text of the spec. 

[18:06:01.0342] <jmdyck>
There's still the question of whether the mechanization's 'code' matches its comments.
