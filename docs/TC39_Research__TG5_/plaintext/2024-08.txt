The Zoom link for today's meeting: https://mozilla.zoom.us/j/93671073041?pwd=3IeRE5anlzEVVWK0GbmIM3P2cxTrow.1 (the previously mentioned link apparently has expired)

FYI: I submitted a protocol to IRB for a think-aloud study and a quantitative study.

I plan to try to recruit some students in my class to actually run it.

Aki I was going to meekly suggest asking here for help e.g. asking people to go through the list of W3C groups and just name some candidates

[08:02:37.0109] <Mikhail Barash>
we are online in the same room now

[08:04:27.0455] <Aki>
computers were a mistake!

[08:04:42.0868] <Aki>
This is the list of working groups https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/

[08:05:50.0893] <Aki>
For every relevant Ecma TC and TG, I'm going through the list and coming up with potentially interested WGs to go chat up. One risk/challenge is that there's already history between a given TG and WG that I don't know about, so I'm trying to gather as much info as possible
