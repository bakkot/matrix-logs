I've added new labels to the issues. If you are currently working on something, can you add an issue for it so it can be tracked? that should help with the well founded problem of it being difficult to follow our work

[11:56:42.0212] <yulia>
if a label is missing let me know and ill add it

Ok, i've brain dumped into the issues: https://github.com/tc39/tg5/issues

[01:35:01.0037] <yulia>
There is more somewhere in the back of my brain but I can't remember right now what those are

[01:35:34.0981] <yulia>
i'll keep adding, but everyone should feel free about adding what they are interested in. I don't want to treat this as my personal curiosity thing, and I feel bad that I am so time poor that I can't help very much with a lot of these

[01:35:54.0550] <yulia>
I also tried to list those that I know are ongoing
