I just saw there's a possible TG5 meeting on the day after the TC39 plenary in Japan. Sounds great -- I hope it works out!

have we received any confirmation yet whether the TG5 meeting will happen in Japan?

Yes, itâ€™s confirmed! The TC39 chairs will post soon an invitation to the plenary in Tokyo, and the information about the TG5 Workshop will be there:
