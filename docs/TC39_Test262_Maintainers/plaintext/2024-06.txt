Hi :) I'd like to bring up `implementation-contributed` again... After some discussions with Yulia and the other implementers, I've come back around to wanting to upstream our `non262` tests to test262. What I'm proposing is to upstream our non262 tests, in test262 format, but without the intention of reworking them to follow exactly what test262 does (e.g. testing a single part of the spec). Based on this, I don't think `staging` is the correct place.

The benefit to us is that we can simplify our testing, and work towards writing new tests in `staging` as opposed to increasing our corpus of `non262` tests. The benefit we see to the community is that we would increase the set of tests available to other implementations, including tests that test cross-cutting concerns, rather than individual bits of functionality.
