1000 distinct cases, but are they all _meaningfully_ distinct?

[08:57:01.0620] <ptomato (intermittent availability)>
I do quite like exhaustively testing large numbers of cases though! (I've been using that exact technique to search for bugs in Temporal implementations.)

[08:57:56.0925] <ptomato (intermittent availability)>
I think snapshot testing (like Jest has) is a good tool for that. if I had time, I'd build a snapshot testing facility for test262

[08:59:24.0904] <ptomato (intermittent availability)>
at least that way, IMO it'd be clearer that the intention isn't for implementations to conform to the results of the snapshots, but instead to investigate when a snapshot fails

[09:00:22.0839] <ptomato (intermittent availability)>
I think that's the risk with a mini-polyfill in test262 - it basically blesses the mini-polyfill as the reference implementation and says to all other implementations, "you must match this implementation bug-for-bug"

[09:01:56.0950] <ptomato (intermittent availability)>
anyway, I'll take another look at that PR and see if I have some suggestions to make it work more like "checking invariant properties of outputs that must hold across multiple inputs"

I'd argue that snapshot tests do the same thing except that you don't get to see the implementation which generated those snapshots, so it's harder to tell where the mismatch comes from.

[09:03:55.0053] <ptomato (intermittent availability)>
yes, I agree that's a risk as well. I think snapshots could better communicate the intention, though

[09:04:18.0176] <bakkot>
In my experience using both kinds of tests, the reference implementation has been a lot more useful for this kind of thing.

[09:04:44.0020] <bakkot>
In particular, sometimes there is a mismatch, and being able to track down why the implementations diverge is incredibly useful both in the case that my implementation is wrong and in the case that the one in the tests is wrong

[09:05:26.0904] <ptomato (intermittent availability)>
I agree! I have a reference implementation of Temporal and I've found it very useful for writing test262 tests. but I'm not putting that reference implementation into test262
