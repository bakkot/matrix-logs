1000 distinct cases, but are they all _meaningfully_ distinct?

I do quite like exhaustively testing large numbers of cases though! (I've been using that exact technique to search for bugs in Temporal implementations.)

I think snapshot testing (like Jest has) is a good tool for that. if I had time, I'd build a snapshot testing facility for test262

at least that way, IMO it'd be clearer that the intention isn't for implementations to conform to the results of the snapshots, but instead to investigate when a snapshot fails

I think that's the risk with a mini-polyfill in test262 - it basically blesses the mini-polyfill as the reference implementation and says to all other implementations, "you must match this implementation bug-for-bug"
