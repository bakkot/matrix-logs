anyone joining maintainers meeting today?

[08:15:49.0404] <Ms2ger>
I can if anyone else is ðŸ˜…

[14:59:32.0448] <ljharb>
(i couldn't make it today)

[15:22:09.0376] <ptomato>
we didn't have much to discuss. just triaged PRs


2024-07-07
[16:49:18.0530] <bakkot>
could I ask for https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3994 to get merged? proposal has been at stage 3 for a while

[16:49:42.0091] <bakkot>
I have some followups but I'll send them as their own PRs so they can be reviewed independently


2024-07-08
[21:56:24.0415] <ljharb>
it needs a rebase but the conflict shouldn't be tricky; i can take care of it tomorrow if nobody objects by then

Are Test262 people able to help with this? https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/3431#issuecomment-2226049270

[10:41:38.0027] <ptomato>
can we get in touch with Brian? I haven't had any response on PRs to those repos, but I haven't yet tried contacting Brian directly

[10:42:20.0998] <ptomato>
I've put it on our meeting agenda for next time

[10:43:16.0806] <JaseW>
Thank you

I can reach out to Brian in the meantime

[11:37:59.0886] <JaseW>
Iâ€™ve chatted with him, he said heâ€™s not involved anymore and itâ€™s up to the committee/test262 editors to decide what they want to do about it.

Heâ€™s happy to give keys if someone wants to upstream the fork or if it needs to be archived etc.

[14:50:58.0846] <ljharb>
JaseW: is he willing to transfer it into the tc39 github org, and npm owner add one of us, so we can keep maintaining it?

[14:53:01.0077] <JaseW>
ljharb: yes he would be fine with that 

[14:53:29.0320] <ljharb>
beautiful, let's do that, and then we're empowered to archive it too if that's what we decide

[14:53:46.0239] <ljharb>
he should be able to bounce it into tc39-transfer still, and he can npm owner add me

[20:59:06.0018] <ljharb>
heads up on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4123 - i'd love them to be merged before the agenda deadline in 2 days :-)

[02:19:25.0042] <Ms2ger>
ljharb: do you consider them ready? I don't know if I'll have time to get them reviewed in detail, but I can take a quick look

[08:24:22.0316] <ljharb>
yes

[08:25:31.0521] <littledan>
In general, there's a lot of test262 stuff out for review, going back to last year. What's the strategy for getting through it and landing everything?

[09:39:49.0168] <ptomato>
we've been splitting it up and landing it in chunks

Hello! Sorry for bothering, I just had a question for the test26 maintainers. Have you ever considered adding more metadata to the `features.txt` file?

For context, at Boa we're maintaining a map of all the current test262 features and its corresponding spec edition that each feature was introduced on (https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/main/tests/tester/src/edition.rs). However, I think it could be worth having this on the repo itself, since I think it's pretty common for people to filter tests per edition.

[08:41:45.0763] <ljharb>
i believe very few implementations actually implement to match editions

[08:42:27.0375] <ljharb>
and given that it's a living standard, anything merged to github is part of the language - the edition is more of a snapshot for historical/ecma reasons

[08:42:37.0110] <ljharb>
that said it'd be fine to include that data i guess?

[08:42:48.0818] <ljharb>
it's also in the proposals table, but not programmatically mappable to test262 features

[08:42:53.0688] <littledan>
I'm curious why boa organizes its JS feature support by editions like that. Most engines treat features individually, uncorrelated.

[08:45:41.0067] <Jedel>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> i believe very few implementations actually implement to match editions

It's not used in the engine itself, we also try to match the latest standard. However, most people checking out the engine ask things like "what is your conformance per ES version?" and we just figured that we could use the features to collect that data

[08:45:52.0492] <Jedel>
Instead of having to filter the tests manually per version

[08:47:04.0201] <ljharb>
hm, that's fair, that's somewhat how https://compat-table.github.io/compat-table/ and https://node.green are organized

[08:47:31.0110] <ljharb>
how do they answer that question for other engines?

[08:50:13.0734] <Jedel>
As you've probably figured out, they also maintain the same mapping

[08:50:19.0401] <Jedel>
E.g. test.fyi https://github.com/test262-fyi/test262.fyi/blob/81861b7aeeb518326147ab2826d4adc184f14686/site/generate.mjs#L242-L458

[08:50:32.0848] <Jedel>
 * E.g. [test262.fyi](https://github.com/test262-fyi/test262.fyi/blob/81861b7aeeb518326147ab2826d4adc184f14686/site/generate.mjs#L242-L458)

[08:51:32.0030] <Jedel>
It would definitely reduce a lot of duplicate effort if that mapping was directly on the main source, which is test262
