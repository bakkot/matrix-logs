could I ask for https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3994 to get merged? proposal has been at stage 3 for a while

[16:49:42.0091] <bakkot>
I have some followups but I'll send them as their own PRs so they can be reviewed independently

it needs a rebase but the conflict shouldn't be tricky; i can take care of it tomorrow if nobody objects by then
