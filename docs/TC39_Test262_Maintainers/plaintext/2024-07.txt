(i couldn't make it today)

[15:22:09.0376] <ptomato>

[16:49:18.0530] <bakkot>
could I ask for https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3994 to get merged? proposal has been at stage 3 for a while

[16:49:42.0091] <bakkot>
I have some followups but I'll send them as their own PRs so they can be reviewed independently

it needs a rebase but the conflict shouldn't be tricky; i can take care of it tomorrow if nobody objects by then

I can reach out to Brian in the meantime

Iâ€™ve chatted with him, he said heâ€™s not involved anymore and itâ€™s up to the committee/test262 editors to decide what they want to do about it.

Heâ€™s happy to give keys if someone wants to upstream the fork or if it needs to be archived etc.

Heâ€™s happy to give keys if someone wants to upstream the fork or archive if thatâ€™s what test262 project decides.

[14:50:58.0846] <ljharb>
JaseW: is he willing to transfer it into the tc39 github org, and npm owner add one of us, so we can keep maintaining it?

[14:53:01.0077] <JaseW>
ljharb: yes he would be fine with that 

[14:53:29.0320] <ljharb>
beautiful, let's do that, and then we're empowered to archive it too if that's what we decide

[14:53:46.0239] <ljharb>
he should be able to bounce it into tc39-transfer still, and he can npm owner add me
