It's been a few months and I'm still waiting on reviews for the following to wrap up Explicit Resource Management:

https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4482
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4481
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4480
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4478

Can someone take a look?

thanks for updating the ones that had reviews on them!

Also, https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4483 and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4481 have been updated based on feedback 

[13:12:59.0184] <rbuckton>
Sure. I amended that first change since I realized it was the wrong fix to the test.

ptomato: Looks like I need a formal approval on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4599 . Would you mind?
