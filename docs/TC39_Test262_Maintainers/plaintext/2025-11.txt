It's been a few months and I'm still waiting on reviews for the following to wrap up Explicit Resource Management:

https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4482
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4481
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4480
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4478

Can someone take a look?

thanks for updating the ones that had reviews on them!

[13:12:16.0399] <rbuckton>
Also, https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4483 and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4481 have been updated based on feedback 

[13:12:59.0184] <rbuckton>
Sure. I amended that first change since I realized it was the wrong fix to the test.

[13:33:04.0314] <jugglinmike>
ptomato: Looks like I need a formal approval on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4599 . Would you mind?

[13:40:13.0989] <ptomato>
I think that was the last issue on these, I'll take a look later today

[13:44:57.0089] <jugglinmike>
Thanks, ptomato !

sorry about this, there's probably something I'm overlooking, but I still think it should be TypeError?

[17:57:50.0410] <ptomato>
e.g. if I understand the explanation correctly then I'd expect these two lines to produce the same error
```js
for (using i = null; i === null; i = { [Symbol.dispose]() { } }) {}
for (const i = null; i === null; i = { [Symbol.dispose]() { } }) {}
```

[17:58:20.0984] <ptomato>
and the latter throws a TypeError due to reassigning to an immutable binding, not a ReferenceError

[18:17:13.0214] <rbuckton>
Ah, you are correct per https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-declarative-environment-records-setmutablebinding-n-v-s step 5.b. I'll fix that

Any chance the last three resource management PRs might get a review this week? I've been trying to get the editors to wrap their review as well so the proposal can move from "Conditional Stage 4" to "Stage 4" ideally for the Tokyo plenary.

[10:42:01.0643] <ptomato>
I'd say it's fairly unlikely from my side - I have a lot of other things on my plate to prepare for plenary

[10:47:26.0545] <ptomato>
I think it'd help if you could get some reviews from the implementors who have been filing bugs against the already-merged PRs, or check that the existing in-progress implementations agree - I can't speak for the other maintainers but my opinion would be to merge them after a quick spot check, if we had some confidence that they were mandating the right behaviour for implementations

[10:48:05.0526] <ptomato>
for me, the time-consuming part is digging into the proposal text for each test
