It's been a few months and I'm still waiting on reviews for the following to wrap up Explicit Resource Management:

https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4482
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4481
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4480
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4478

Can someone take a look?

thanks for updating the ones that had reviews on them!

[13:12:16.0399] <rbuckton>
Also, https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4483 and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4481 have been updated based on feedback 

[13:12:59.0184] <rbuckton>
Sure. I amended that first change since I realized it was the wrong fix to the test.

ptomato: Looks like I need a formal approval on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4599 . Would you mind?

[13:40:13.0989] <ptomato>
I think that was the last issue on these, I'll take a look later today

[13:44:57.0089] <jugglinmike>
Thanks, ptomato !

sorry about this, there's probably something I'm overlooking, but I still think it should be TypeError?

[17:57:50.0410] <ptomato>
e.g. if I understand the explanation correctly then I'd expect these two lines to produce the same error
```js
for (using i = null; i === null; i = { [Symbol.dispose]() { } }) {}
for (const i = null; i === null; i = { [Symbol.dispose]() { } }) {}
```

[17:58:20.0984] <ptomato>
and the latter throws a TypeError due to reassigning to an immutable binding, not a ReferenceError

[18:17:13.0214] <rbuckton>
Ah, you are correct per https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-declarative-environment-records-setmutablebinding-n-v-s step 5.b. I'll fix that
