heads up that i just force-pushed out some commits from `main` that were mistakenly pushed there from a PR

[09:52:46.0528] <ptomato>
ugh, my bad, I think - so sorry! I looked at the scrollback in my terminal and can't understand how I did it though

[09:53:01.0614] <ptomato>
AFAICT I only pushed to the remote `git@github.com:Aurele-Barriere/test262.git`

[09:56:42.0249] <ljharb>
did you use `gh checkout`?

[09:56:56.0078] <ljharb>
because it doesn't work specifically when the PR branch name is `main`

[09:57:06.0179] <ljharb>
* because pushing to that doesn't work specifically when the PR branch name is `main`

[09:57:17.0416] <ljharb>
iow you pushed to the right branch name but the wrong origin

[09:57:20.0335] <ljharb>
* iow you pushed to the right branch name but the wrong remote

[10:04:15.0360] <ptomato>
is that a github quirk or something?

[10:05:04.0921] <ptomato>
I didn't use `gh checkout`
