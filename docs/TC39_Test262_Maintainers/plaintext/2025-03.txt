I'm in the waiting room and not entirely sure how to join

[08:06:26.0280] <ljharb>

heads up that i just force-pushed out some commits from `main` that were mistakenly pushed there from a PR

[09:52:46.0528] <ptomato>
ugh, my bad, I think - so sorry! I looked at the scrollback in my terminal and can't understand how I did it though

[09:53:01.0614] <ptomato>
AFAICT I only pushed to the remote `git@github.com:Aurele-Barriere/test262.git`
