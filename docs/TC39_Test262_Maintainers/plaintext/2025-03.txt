[08:04:54.0532] <Ms2ger>

[08:06:12.0100] <ptomato>
I'm in the waiting room and not entirely sure how to join

[08:06:26.0280] <ljharb>
Same. Maybe the settings changed or something?

heads up that i just force-pushed out some commits from `main` that were mistakenly pushed there from a PR

[09:52:46.0528] <ptomato>
ugh, my bad, I think - so sorry! I looked at the scrollback in my terminal and can't understand how I did it though

[09:53:01.0614] <ptomato>
AFAICT I only pushed to the remote `git@github.com:Aurele-Barriere/test262.git`

[09:56:42.0249] <ljharb>
did you use `gh checkout`?

[09:56:56.0078] <ljharb>
because it doesn't work specifically when the PR branch name is `main`

[09:57:06.0179] <ljharb>
* because pushing to that doesn't work specifically when the PR branch name is `main`

[09:57:17.0416] <ljharb>
iow you pushed to the right branch name but the wrong origin

[09:57:20.0335] <ljharb>
* iow you pushed to the right branch name but the wrong remote

[10:04:15.0360] <ptomato>
is that a github quirk or something?

[10:05:04.0921] <ptomato>
I didn't use `gh checkout`

[10:07:30.0753] <ptomato>
I had the PR commits on a local branch named `Aurele-Barriere/main`, and I did `git push git@github.com:Aurele-Barriere/test262.git main -f` - which was mistaken, I should have done `HEAD:main` instead of `main`

[10:08:13.0544] <ptomato>
but in the output I got this:
```
To github.com:Aurele-Barriere/test262.git
 + 1f60c56f6d...e611532c98 main -> main (forced update)
```

[10:08:47.0668] <ptomato>
so I figured I accidentally synced the fork's `main` branch to tc39/test262's `main`

[10:09:11.0332] <ptomato>
which would have been somewhat rude of me but ultimately harmless 😅

[10:09:40.0832] <ptomato>
but this _actually_ overwrote tc39/test262's `main`??

[10:12:29.0018] <ljharb>
hmm

[10:15:55.0805] <ljharb>
ok so it looked like the last PR merged was the commit i pushed main back to. https://github.com/tc39/test262/commit/48bb2621838bac390f38f4fdf0735e5cbecfaed5 has 4 commits that aren't on main now. did those come from PRs?

[10:16:33.0533] <ljharb>
ahhh ok yes, so maybe i misunderstood

[10:17:14.0183] <ljharb>
ok, i re-pushed those commits back. you're correct, you only pushed main to the PR author's fork, you didn't push anything to main. sorry for the confusion.

[10:20:35.0122] <ptomato>
yeah, those last 4 commits came from PRs that I merged yesterday

[10:22:19.0836] <ptomato>
I'm getting a clearer picture of what must have happened; I pushed `main` to the fork and that only succeeded because the PR was made from the fork's `main` branch, and that closed the PR. then once the PR was closed I lost permission to re-push the PR commits to the fork's `main`

[10:22:30.0661] <ptomato>
ok, less confused now 😅

[10:22:35.0549] <ljharb>
yes, exactly right

[10:22:40.0190] <ljharb>
i was confused too clearly :-)

[13:36:44.0094] <ljharb>
* i was confused too, clearly :-)
