do we have a mechanism for disabling tests as suggested in https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/3780 ? I don't think we've disabled tests for other proposals such as cleanupSome that were demoted to stage 2 or split off another proposal at stage 2

[10:26:26.0333] <shu>
i'm not aware of a mechanism to keep the tests in-tree but disabled

[10:26:43.0194] <shu>
good call on cleanupSome i don't even remember what we did then

[12:22:04.0088] <ljharb>
i'd think we'd just remove them? it's easy to revert the removal later

[12:22:16.0191] <ljharb>
are there tests for async iterator helpers?

[12:25:52.0927] <ptomato>
they may be part of the outdated PR for iterator helpers, but none are merged into main

[13:04:05.0540] <bakkot>
also the implementation is going to become radically different so I do not recommend writing tests yet

i don't think i can make today's meeting

[08:08:14.0344] <ptomato>
ah, no worries. Richard Gibson Rick Waldron how about you?

[08:08:52.0876] <Richard Gibson>
thanks for the ping, joining now

ljharb: one question that came up in the meeting, is arraybuffer transfer fully covered now that the PRs from you and Shu have been landed?

[10:35:41.0379] <ljharb>
my PR was .detached, i'm not sure if transfer and transferToFixedLength are both covered

[10:35:47.0354] <ljharb>
but if so, then yes i'd say it's covered

[10:36:12.0963] <ptomato>
I haven't seen anything go by for transferToFixedLength

[10:36:15.0675] <ptomato>
thanks

[10:41:38.0596] <ljharb>
the existing transfer tests, and https://github.com/es-shims/ArrayBuffer.prototype.transferToFixedLength/blob/main/test/tests.js, can be used as inspiration for anyone who wants to work on it
