do we have a mechanism for disabling tests as suggested in https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/3780 ? I don't think we've disabled tests for other proposals such as cleanupSome that were demoted to stage 2 or split off another proposal at stage 2

i'm not aware of a mechanism to keep the tests in-tree but disabled

[10:26:43.0194] <shu>
good call on cleanupSome i don't even remember what we did then

[12:22:04.0088] <ljharb>
i'd think we'd just remove them? it's easy to revert the removal later

[12:22:16.0191] <ljharb>
are there tests for async iterator helpers?

[12:25:52.0927] <ptomato>
they may be part of the outdated PR for iterator helpers, but none are merged into main

[13:04:05.0540] <bakkot>
also the implementation is going to become radically different so I do not recommend writing tests yet
