do we have a mechanism for disabling tests as suggested in https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/3780 ? I don't think we've disabled tests for other proposals such as cleanupSome that were demoted to stage 2 or split off another proposal at stage 2

i'm not aware of a mechanism to keep the tests in-tree but disabled
