Sending my regrets for today's meeting

[08:05:52.0498] <Ms2ger>
ljharb: you attending today?

[08:06:39.0282] <ljharb>
nope, i'm still in japan

[08:07:11.0225] <ptomato>
maybe we should officially cancel? I think Richard is still in Japan also

[09:16:34.0750] <Richard Gibson>
yeah, sorry for the lack of notice. I'll be back on schedule for the next one

hi all, v8 is working on a 2-way test262 bot and ran into the following blocker: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3940

[13:31:15.0604] <shu>
not sure if that would require sign-off from maintainer group consensus

[13:56:43.0322] <ljharb>
it's a trivial change, i just want a second maintainer to look at it before it lands

would also appreciate a decision on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3943, which is also blocking the work

[11:24:57.0614] <ptomato>
oh, haha, I was just reviewing that as you messaged

[11:25:03.0590] <ptomato>
makes sense to me

[11:25:34.0408] <shu>
perfect, thank you :)
