is there a maintainers meeting this week? I wanted to attend, follow the discussion around the async helpers RFC if there is any, but maybe people are away this week

I'm here

I don't remember how we got to the idea that there were only a handful of `.then($DONE, $DONE)` invocations:

```
~/repos/test262$ grep -HErn 'then\(\$DONE, \$DONE\)' test/ | cut -d : -f 1 | sort | uniq | grep -v 'test/harness/' | wc -l
5276
```

Either way, I don't mind writing a transform, but does that change the approach we want to take to existing tests?
Also, unrelatedly, I realized `grep -ia` and `grep -HErn` are some of my more common invocations, and they can be combined into `grep -HErnia` ðŸ˜³

Also jugglinmike I couldn't find anything in the linter checking async flags, are there other changes we were talking about? Sorry, I forgot what the conclusion was around what might need to be changed in the linter
