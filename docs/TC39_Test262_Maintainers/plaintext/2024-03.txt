Can I suggest a policy of not force-pushing to branches people are working on, even just force-pushing to rebase? I'm used to the convention of clicking the "update with merge commit" button, which makes it much more obvious what's happened when one's local branch is out of date.

Igalia has an all hands next week during the maintainers meeting. how would people feel about moving it to the following week?

happy to hear the other maintainer's thoughts, but the convention on github is pretty commonly that force pushes are expected

I have never had anyone else force push to a branch I was working on prior to me saying the branch was ready to merge, so I don't this this convention is that widespread

everyone else just pushes new commits, which means if they want to run CI with the branch updated to main they click the "update with merge commit" button
