Can I suggest a policy of not force-pushing to branches people are working on, even just force-pushing to rebase? I'm used to the convention of clicking the "update with merge commit" button, which makes it much more obvious what's happened when one's local branch is out of date.

Igalia has an all hands next week during the maintainers meeting. how would people feel about moving it to the following week?
