I could use a maintainer stamp on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3823 ... my colleague Aditi had a look over it already. it's a large PR but quite repetitive so shouldn't be too hard to review

if the maintainers could prioritize review and merging of https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2818 that would be appreciated!
