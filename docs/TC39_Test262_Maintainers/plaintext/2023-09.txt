could i get a quick merge on typo fix: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3927

[17:11:36.0922] <shu>
tyty

ljharb: at V8 we're in the process of setting up a 2-way sync for test262 much like WPT. the infra folks are now requesting implementer permissions be given to https://github.com/test262-pr-bot to open PRs and land PRs in staging/

[10:46:39.0550] <shu>
could you add that account to the team? (or do i have permissions? i couldn't figure it out)

[10:46:41.0711] <ljharb>
i think the goal was to have 2 humans reviewing it, will the bot ensure that before landing?

[10:47:16.0336] <shu>
i don't recall the 2 humans thing (i thought it was 1 human), but we will be doing reviews on V8 CI side like WPT

[10:47:37.0694] <shu>
so the reviews happen as part of landing a CL in V8, with OWNER reviews and all that

[10:47:53.0296] <shu>
once the "parent" CL lands, the test262 staging tests as part of that V8 CL gets exported to an upstream PR and landed

[10:48:23.0260] <shu>
but they will always be gated by review on the V8 CI side in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/

[10:48:58.0566] <shu>
specifically their list of permission requests is:

Contents Access: Read and write
Metadata Access: Read-only
Pull requests Access: Read and write
Collaborator Access: Write


[10:49:15.0315] <shu>
i don't know if that's a token thing for the fine-grained access tokens, or a teams thing

[10:50:33.0185] <ptomato>
I don't remember a 2-humans rule either, I think we like to have more than one review if possible on "finished" tests landing, but that doesn't apply to staging. IIRC the deal with staging was that implementor teams could land the PRs themselves, with the requirement being that the tests had to execute properly

[10:50:41.0450] <shu>
right

[10:50:43.0611] <shu>
this is purely for staging

[10:51:08.0238] <shu>
2-way sync bot for non-staging doesn't make sense because V8/JSC/SpiderMonkey implementers aren't equipped to review main trunk tests anyway

[10:51:12.0446] <ljharb>
it's 2 humans in the sense that 1 human puts it up and 1 reviews

[10:51:20.0525] <ljharb>
if a bot puts it up, then only one human reviews

[10:51:26.0539] <shu>
oh yes, this is a "bot" in the sense it makes the PR

[10:51:38.0028] <shu>
the humans in the process are: the author of the V8 CL, and the reviewer(s) of the V8 CL

[10:51:40.0968] <shu>
so at least 2 humans are in the loop

[10:51:44.0428] <ljharb>
i shouldn't be able to initiate my own PR and then review it

[10:51:52.0638] <shu>
the bot definitely enforces that

[10:51:54.0583] <ljharb>
as long as the bot's ensuring 2 humans are in the loop then i'm good

[10:51:57.0599] <ljharb>
will add it now

[10:52:00.0977] <shu>
it is impossible to land self-reviewed CLs in Gerrit

[10:52:08.0367] <ljharb>
in github too

[10:52:26.0192] <shu>
in fact we get bitten by this when you try to fix someone's typos for them, and the system re-marks you as an author, now they can't land it...

[10:52:39.0432] <ljharb>
k, invite sent

ljharb: does that list mean anything to you?

[10:53:23.0754] <shu>
is it a teams thing or an access tokens thing?

[10:53:57.0295] <ljharb>
oh that's different, they want a token or something

[10:54:07.0889] <ljharb>
but i added the github account, so someone can log in with that and make their own token

[10:56:54.0927] <shu>
makes sense, thanks

[11:02:39.0657] <shu>
ljharb: hm, don't see an invite on the https://github.com/test262-pr-bot account yet

[11:02:47.0760] <shu>
i wonder if it also needs to be invited to the tc39 team or something?

[11:07:04.0607] <shu>
oh wait no, maybe i can add directly to the v8 subteam

[11:07:10.0363] <shu>
sorry i'm not familiar with GH stuff

[11:07:19.0512] <ljharb>
it was invited to the team and org at the same time

[11:07:28.0331] <shu>
strange

[11:07:34.0953] <ljharb>
visit https://github.com/tc39 and you should see the invite tho
