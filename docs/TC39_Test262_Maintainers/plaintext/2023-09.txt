ljharb: at V8 we're in the process of setting up a 2-way sync for test262 much like WPT. the infra folks are now requesting implementer permissions be given to https://github.com/test262-pr-bot to open PRs and land PRs in staging/

[10:46:39.0550] <shu>
could you add that account to the team? (or do i have permissions? i couldn't figure it out)

[10:46:41.0711] <ljharb>
i think the goal was to have 2 humans reviewing it, will the bot ensure that before landing?

[10:47:16.0336] <shu>
i don't recall the 2 humans thing (i thought it was 1 human), but we will be doing reviews on V8 CI side like WPT

[10:47:37.0694] <shu>
so the reviews happen as part of landing a CL in V8, with OWNER reviews and all that

[10:47:53.0296] <shu>
once the "parent" CL lands, the test262 staging tests as part of that V8 CL gets exported to an upstream PR and landed

[10:48:23.0260] <shu>
but they will always be gated by review on the V8 CI side in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/

[10:48:58.0566] <shu>
specifically their list of permission requests is:

Contents Access: Read and write
Metadata Access: Read-only
Pull requests Access: Read and write
Collaborator Access: Write


[10:49:15.0315] <shu>
i don't know if that's a token thing for the fine-grained access tokens, or a teams thing
