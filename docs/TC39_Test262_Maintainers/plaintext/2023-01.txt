hey jugglinmike when do you think you'll have a chance to take a look at the refactored test selection? I want to make sure we address the cases you care about before merging - or alternatively, do you think moving to final comment is independent from that and we can follow it up in parallel?

as per the discussion in last week's meeting, I've moved the RFC to final comment period

Final comment period has closed, we can merge https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3724 and I've marked https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3728 ready for review

I can't believe it's already been 3 weeks since the last time, but there it is on the calendar! maintainers meeting starts in 1 min

here's a draft of what we can announce during the test262 status update next week:
- For stage 3 proposals, we now have tests for isWellFormed. We've had recent PRs making progress on coverage of Array.fromAsync, RegExp modifiers, ArrayBuffer transfer, Temporal, Intl.NumberFormat V3, and Intl.DurationFormat. We'd love help on others; some of them already have volunteers so ask in the "TC39 Test262 Maintainers" channel on Matrix if you're interested, to make sure we don't have overlapping efforts on the same thing!
- Our trial run of our new RFC process was successful and we've used it to make some adjustments to our (now-official process document / draft process document, which will become official soon) (depending on whether it's merged before the start of the meeting)
- In further news about contributor documentation, (we're preparing / we've written) (depending on whether it's merged before the start of the meeting) a document explaining the rationales for some existing choices made in the test262 codebase. We're hoping to add to this as new questions come up so that it's a place where contributors can get answers to the question "why is this like this, and what should I to know if I want to change it?"

comments welcome!
