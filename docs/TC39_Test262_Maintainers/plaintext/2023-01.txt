hey jugglinmike when do you think you'll have a chance to take a look at the refactored test selection? I want to make sure we address the cases you care about before merging - or alternatively, do you think moving to final comment is independent from that and we can follow it up in parallel?

as per the discussion in last week's meeting, I've moved the RFC to final comment period

Final comment period has closed, we can merge https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3724 and I've marked https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3728 ready for review
