Would it be possible to move our meeting to tomorrow?

[09:10:56.0181] <ptomato>
that would work for me, though 1 hour earlier or 1 hour later tomorrow would work even better

i won't be able to make it if it's moved; my days fill up well more than 24 hours in advance :-) no need to schedule on my account alone tho.

[09:37:15.0268] <Rick Waldron>
ptomato an hour later, tomorrow, works for me as well
