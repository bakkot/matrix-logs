Would it be possible to move our meeting to tomorrow?

[09:10:56.0181] <ptomato>
that would work for me, though 1 hour earlier or 1 hour later tomorrow would work even better

i won't be able to make it if it's moved; my days fill up well more than 24 hours in advance :-) no need to schedule on my account alone tho.

[09:37:15.0268] <Rick Waldron>
ptomato an hour later, tomorrow, works for me as well

Reminder this week's meeting is async, aka time to spend working on and commenting on various docs. Suggested links to start with listed in the agenda.

thoughts on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3443 ? I think this is a good test, and it is good to have this sort of thing covered, but it seems to me that this falls under "regression tests" which we're discussing in Mike's rationales document (https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3423/files#diff-21661bf16a5bc633cd2583a093e02716b600e494fc741c5e52291b014d051a44R104) and I'm not sure where others would draw the line. so a quick temperature check seems in order

Hey everyone, I'm not going to be available until after around noon. If someone else would like to give the update, go for it!

what's the best way to ask that mike become an invited expert? https://github.com/tc39/Admin-and-Business/issues/204 maybe sarah and/or rick could ask the chairs?
