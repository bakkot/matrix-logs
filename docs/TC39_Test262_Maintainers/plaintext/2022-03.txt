Would it be possible to move our meeting to tomorrow?

that would work for me, though 1 hour earlier or 1 hour later tomorrow would work even better

i won't be able to make it if it's moved; my days fill up well more than 24 hours in advance :-) no need to schedule on my account alone tho.

ptomato an hour later, tomorrow, works for me as well
