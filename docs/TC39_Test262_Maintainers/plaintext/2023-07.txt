Ms2ger: if you merged anba's PR with automerge, it did something weird, so maybe we shouldn't use that

[08:33:33.0633] <Ms2ger>
ljharb: huh, interesting. First time that happened to me with automerge

is there a column limit for the test262 tests?

not afaik

btw, since next week is plenary, i'm deleting our maintainers call from the calendar

just to check, would a (big) PR updating old tests to use `assert.sameValue`/etc (instead of checking themself and throwing their own test262error) be welcome?

seems like an improvement, assuming semantics are the same

[09:50:57.0873] <canadahonk>
yeah making sure, opened draft pr whilst checking results

I gave an off-the-cuff update from test262 in the meeting this morning. hope that was OK - I believe the last meeting was skipped so I assumed no one else prepared one

[04:26:38.0614] <ryzokuken ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´>
it was definitely OK from my POV

I added a few items to the next meeting's agenda; in particular, our hosts at this TC39 plenary, a research group at University of Bergen, are interested in having students collaborate with us to write some test262 tests. I imagine we would welcome the help, if there were suitable projects for the students

[04:06:02.0773] <ptomato (at TC39, limited availability)>
the other discussion item is that the cleanupSome proposal may be withdrawn in a future plenary, and it's one of the few stage 2 proposals that has already-merged tests, so it has some implications for us

[04:38:08.0489] <rbuckton>
Though I'd contributed to test262 in the past, I found it very difficult to get started on the tests for `using` as I found the documentation was somewhat lacking in terms of how to set up the environment, and I had trouble running the tests on Windows and had to use WSL. 

[04:38:17.0712] <rbuckton>
Plus there is a lot of hunting around to figure out what files you need to add to `includes: []` for some assertions. The experience of working with test262 in an editor like VSCode wasn't great. 

[04:39:24.0628] <ptomato (at TC39, limited availability)>
do any of the other maintainers/contributors in this channel build/run the tests on Windows?

[04:42:03.0814] <rbuckton>
The package.json uses syntax that isn't legal in either cmd.exe or Powershell (namely the use of `$()` to collect diffs.

[04:42:24.0915] <Ms2ger>
Do we have an issue about that?

[04:43:53.0818] <rbuckton>
I also don't see a way to easily run lint locally
