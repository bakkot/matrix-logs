Ms2ger: if you merged anba's PR with automerge, it did something weird, so maybe we shouldn't use that

[08:33:33.0633] <Ms2ger>
ljharb: huh, interesting. First time that happened to me with automerge

is there a column limit for the test262 tests?

just to check, would a (big) PR updating old tests to use `assert.sameValue`/etc (instead of checking themself and throwing their own test262error) be welcome?

seems like an improvement, assuming semantics are the same

[09:50:57.0873] <canadahonk>
yeah making sure, opened draft pr whilst checking results

I gave an off-the-cuff update from test262 in the meeting this morning. hope that was OK - I believe the last meeting was skipped so I assumed no one else prepared one

[04:26:38.0614] <ryzokuken ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´>
it was definitely OK from my POV

I added a few items to the next meeting's agenda; in particular, our hosts at this TC39 plenary, a research group at University of Bergen, are interested in having students collaborate with us to write some test262 tests. I imagine we would welcome the help, if there were suitable projects for the students
