following up from today's meeting, we'd like to find out if any implementations are actually running the tests in `implementation-contributed` currently. it sounds like SpiderMonkey is not.

cc shu linusg JaseW for V8, LibJS, Boa ðŸ˜„ - I'll ask in the webkit slack as well

[08:55:06.0647] <ptomato>
it seems like the current state of it is a years-outdated copy of some V8 and WebKit tests

[08:55:31.0744] <linusg>
LibJS never has AFAICT, but it has its own tests downstream

ptomato:  could you ask Kevin Ness for Boa, heâ€™s been maintaining the test262 harness and implementation for a while now, Iâ€™m not 100% sure and not at a computer.

[09:38:23.0988] <shu>
ptomato: V8 doesn't AFAICT

[09:38:59.0637] <shu>
ptomato: that may or may not be intentional, i don't know. the test runner only picks up tests in `test/`

[09:40:37.0792] <shu>
what do you have in mind for `implementation-contributed/`?

[09:44:51.0970] <ljharb>
we're deciding whether to move stuff to staging, or to just delete the dir

 * we're deciding whether to move stuff to staging, or to just delete the dir (or a secret third option we haven't figured out yet)

put up https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4069 for Promise.try, hopefully it's a quick review

sounds like Boa does not run implementation-contributed and JSC does not even import it
