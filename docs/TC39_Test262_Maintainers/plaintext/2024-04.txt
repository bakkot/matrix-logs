dpu: I think I'd suggest for a newbie to use a different resource than ECMA-262 to learn to write correct code! there are lots of resources out there that are written with newbie-level and intermediate-level JS programmers in mind, such as MDN (here's their page on the Map constructor: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/Map)

dpu: that said, it can be a really interesting exercise to go through the spec and find exactly where/why something is happening. in the case of that specific question, you would need to look at the ECMAScript grammar, because that code_of_Map2.png is not a syntactically valid program. in that context, the `{` token means the parser has to parse an [ObjectLiteral](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-ObjectLiteral), and the following `'` token is not valid in any of the branches for ObjectLiteral.
