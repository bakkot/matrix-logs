dpu: I think I'd suggest for a newbie to use a different resource than ECMA-262 to learn to write correct code! there are lots of resources out there that are written with newbie-level and intermediate-level JS programmers in mind, such as MDN (here's their page on the Map constructor: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/Map)

dpu: that said, it can be a really interesting exercise to go through the spec and find exactly where/why something is happening. in the case of that specific question, you would need to look at the ECMAScript grammar, because that code_of_Map2.png is not a syntactically valid program. in that context, the `{` token means the parser has to parse an [ObjectLiteral](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-ObjectLiteral), and the following `'` token is not valid in any of the branches for ObjectLiteral.

on the other hand, if the program is syntactically valid but you have questions about the behaviour of the Map constructor, then you would need to consult the algorithm steps that define its behaviour: https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-map-iterable

you can probably find more resources for beginners in #tc39-beginners:matrix.org

Thank you so much for the detailed answer, ptomato. The keyword 'ObjextLiteral' and 'Map ( [ iterable ] )' had make me clear. Have a good day :)

glad to help!

https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/3953 seems like it continues to confuse contributors. any objections to just commenting out the ChakraCore CI job?

[12:24:44.0609] <ptomato>
FWIW I'm skeptical that we get much value from any of those CI jobs running on individual engines, except for ESMeta; contributors tend to interpret them as "does XYZ engine pass all the tests in this PR" rather than what they actually signify, "does XYZ engine execute these tests without crashing" (or, increasingly, "is XYZ engine able to be installed using ESVU" ðŸ˜›)
