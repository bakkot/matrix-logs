dpu: I think I'd suggest for a newbie to use a different resource than ECMA-262 to learn to write correct code! there are lots of resources out there that are written with newbie-level and intermediate-level JS programmers in mind, such as MDN (here's their page on the Map constructor: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/Map)

[10:55:06.0980] <ptomato>
dpu: that said, it can be a really interesting exercise to go through the spec and find exactly where/why something is happening. in the case of that specific question, you would need to look at the ECMAScript grammar, because that code_of_Map2.png is not a syntactically valid program. in that context, the `{` token means the parser has to parse an [ObjectLiteral](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-ObjectLiteral), and the following `'` token is not valid in any of the branches for ObjectLiteral.

[10:56:44.0833] <ptomato>
on the other hand, if the program is syntactically valid but you have questions about the behaviour of the Map constructor, then you would need to consult the algorithm steps that define its behaviour: https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-map-iterable

[10:57:07.0898] <ptomato>
you can probably find more resources for beginners in #tc39-beginners:matrix.org

[11:05:43.0949] <dpu>
Thank you so much for the detailed answer, ptomato. The keyword 'ObjextLiteral' and 'Map ( [ iterable ] )' had make me clear. Have a good day :)

[11:06:43.0266] <ptomato>
glad to help!

https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/3953 seems like it continues to confuse contributors. any objections to just commenting out the ChakraCore CI job?

[12:24:44.0609] <ptomato>
FWIW I'm skeptical that we get much value from any of those CI jobs running on individual engines, except for ESMeta; contributors tend to interpret them as "does XYZ engine pass all the tests in this PR" rather than what they actually signify, "does XYZ engine execute these tests without crashing" (or, increasingly, "is XYZ engine able to be installed using ESVU" üòõ)

[12:25:51.0609] <ptomato>
besides, both questions seem to be covered sufficiently by test262.fyi

next maintainers meeting is next week, during the plenary. should we postpone it again, or just skip this one?

[13:17:11.0792] <ljharb>
We always skip meetings during plenary week

I forgot to put on the agenda last time that we should discuss what to cover in the plenary update

[12:52:04.0535] <ptomato>
how's this for bullet points?

- Since January, a certain amount of Igalia's test262 development has been subsidized by [Sovereign Tech Fund](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/)
- You may have noticed that many more tests landed in Q1 2024 than in Q4 2023
- Worked with proposal authors to review tests and ensure coverage for **RegExp modifiers** and **Set methods** Wrote tests for a [needs-consensus PR](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2600) that had long been blocked on test coverage
- We'd like to encourage proposals to help write testing plans. Providing good documentation for this is high on our list. Let us know what you think about this!

[12:53:19.0462] <ptomato>
(yes, as far as I can tell, the embargo on announcing the subsidy is finally lifted)

[12:55:02.0596] <ljharb>
awesome

my friends

[13:07:14.0779] <shu>
how's the resizable buffer review going

[13:29:11.0483] <ptomato>
you may have seen https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4030 ?

[13:29:45.0426] <ptomato>
and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3888#issuecomment-2025620598

[13:30:54.0257] <ptomato>
ioanna is leading the effort to get it into reviewable chunks

[13:30:54.0688] <shu>
i did, yes

[16:11:04.0434] <Chris de Almeida>
hey folks -- who will be handing the 262 report at plenary and how much time do you need?

[16:14:03.0125] <ptomato>
I guess by default it's me unless any of the rest of y'all feel like delivering it! FWIW I'll just be showing and reading out the above bullet points

[16:14:33.0866] <ptomato>
so, max 10 minutes if there's any discussion?
