dpu: I think I'd suggest for a newbie to use a different resource than ECMA-262 to learn to write correct code! there are lots of resources out there that are written with newbie-level and intermediate-level JS programmers in mind, such as MDN (here's their page on the Map constructor: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/Map)
