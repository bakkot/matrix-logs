see Justin Ridgewell's request in #tc39-delegates:matrix.org for write access to https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3354 and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3353 - can we implement fine-grained access like that? or just temporarily add him to the team?

because of codeowners, i think i can do it without giving him merge ability.

can I ping on getting https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3619 merged? jugglinmike approved except for the license, which I've fixed

I think we can just merge it then? I don't have time to review it all over again but if that was the only thing...?

Sorry I dropped the ball there, bakkot 

[10:33:38.0300] <bakkot>
not to worry

I also forgot

[11:29:26.0777] <shu>
question about the staging CODEOWNERs thing: in https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3654, am i supposed to be able to click the merge button?

[11:29:41.0070] <shu>
because i can't

[11:30:01.0778] <shu>
or maybe the finer grained ACL doesn't have UI integration?
