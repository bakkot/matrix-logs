see Justin Ridgewell's request in #tc39-delegates:matrix.org for write access to https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3354 and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3353 - can we implement fine-grained access like that? or just temporarily add him to the team?

can I ping on getting https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3619 merged? jugglinmike approved except for the license, which I've fixed

I think we can just merge it then? I don't have time to review it all over again but if that was the only thing...?
