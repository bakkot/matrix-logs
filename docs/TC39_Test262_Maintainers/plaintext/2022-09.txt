see Justin Ridgewell's request in #tc39-delegates:matrix.org for write access to https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3354 and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3353 - can we implement fine-grained access like that? or just temporarily add him to the team?

because of codeowners, i think i can do it without giving him merge ability.

can I ping on getting https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3619 merged? jugglinmike approved except for the license, which I've fixed

[12:46:25.0916] <ptomato>
I think we can just merge it then? I don't have time to review it all over again but if that was the only thing...?

Sorry I dropped the ball there, bakkot 

[10:33:38.0300] <bakkot>
not to worry

[10:33:41.0418] <bakkot>
I also forgot

[11:29:26.0777] <shu>
question about the staging CODEOWNERs thing: in https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3654, am i supposed to be able to click the merge button?

[11:29:41.0070] <shu>
because i can't

[11:30:01.0778] <shu>
or maybe the finer grained ACL doesn't have UI integration?

[11:38:30.0131] <ptomato>
good question. I can't click the merge button either

[11:38:37.0916] <ptomato>
I should be able to now that you acked it

[11:42:15.0738] <ptomato>
I wonder if it's set up to require approval from test262-staging _and_ test262-maintainers, instead of _or_

[11:49:16.0058] <shu>
ljharb: ^

[12:07:50.0101] <ljharb>
It should be an or, i think - Iâ€™ll look into it

[12:32:58.0504] <Justin Ridgewell>
Does the "awaiting author" label need to be removed for #3354 and #3353 to be reviewed again?

that's not the blocking factor; just someone getting around to it ðŸ˜…

[14:11:54.0104] <ptomato>
sorry

[14:12:32.0868] <Justin Ridgewell>
All good. I didn't know if you filtered out that label in when your looking for PRs that need review

[14:13:07.0682] <ptomato>
but, I'll remove the label anyway as it's no longer accurate
