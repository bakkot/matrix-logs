I realized Array.fromAsync is the first async built-in function in JS, but there's also iterator helpers coming down the line soon

[16:16:26.0937] <ptomato>
I'm thinking it'd be good to have some boilerplate in helpers/ for testing async functions

[16:18:49.0691] <ptomato>
for example, there's example code in https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-asynchronous-tests for checking the exception type of a rejected promise. but it only works once because it uses "return a string" to mean "fail"

[16:19:08.0640] <ptomato>
so if you want to do the async equivalent of https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/test/built-ins/Array/from/mapfn-is-not-callable-typeerror.js you have to write something more complicated

[16:20:01.0677] <ptomato>
any thoughts?

I opened an RFC on the above: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3724 (here's a link to it [rendered](https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3724/files?short_path=d4e487d#diff-d4e487dcd72bb7cd7462c9709f50abd806977f296306b5f4eb77e3fc011ede51))
