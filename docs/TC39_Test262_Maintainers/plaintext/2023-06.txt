Could anyone point me to recent test262 results for JSC/SM/V8? Ever since test262.report is dead those seem increasingly difficult to find (or my search skills are getting worse 😄)

ptomato: every Temporal test fails on builds without i18n because of temporalHarness.js

[16:19:06.0799] <shu>
```
/b/s/w/ir/test/test262/data/harness/temporalHelpers.js:10: SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /^[$_\p{ID_Start}][$\u200C\u200D\p{ID_Continue}]*$/u: Invalid property name in character class

err, temporalHelpers.js

[00:05:50.0364] <ptomato>
I'll take a look, thanks for the heads up!

[01:53:50.0013] <ptomato>
shu: no problem to change that since it's only used for formatting property names, but as far as I can tell from reading ECMA-262, even implementations without i18n are required to support those properties?

[01:55:43.0030] <ptomato>
(by "those properties" I mean `ID_Start` and `ID_Continue`)

[01:58:39.0541] <canadahonk>
yeah, wasn't that part of https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-unicode-property-escapes ?

[06:34:43.0047] <canadahonk>
https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3842 for ref btw :)

[07:39:36.0473] <shu>
ptomato: huh, oh really? let's see

[07:51:04.0662] <shu>
so i think what's happening is, V8 depends on ICU for those property names, which is pretty reasonable, because that's where those property names are

[07:51:21.0485] <shu>
and the "no i18n" build is actually the "no ICU dependency" build

[07:55:02.0286] <shu>
in any case i think i agree with your reading of the spec, but in practice i don't know yet

[07:57:36.0543] <canadahonk>
it no longer uses those in main now btw

[07:57:53.0789] <shu>
thank you

[08:40:33.0735] <Richard Gibson>
I agree with ptomato, and it looks to me like not just `/…/u` regular expressions but also String.prototype.toLowerCase and toUpperCase depend upon the Unicode Character Database (e.g., `"İKÅΩↃΣ".toLowerCase() === "i̇kåωↄς"` and `"ßⅶςµﬀև".toUpperCase() === "SSⅦΣΜFFԵՒ"` must hold in every implementation). UAX #44 should probably move from Bibliography to Normative References. 🤔

[09:47:10.0879] <shu>
we should probably discuss if implementations that actually don't ship Intl (Moddable) still support these features, or if we need to redraw the optionality line for stuff along ICU lines

[09:47:23.0437] <shu>
the no-i18n build for V8 is mostly not that well supported

[09:48:04.0965] <shu>
that is, in an ideal world, we'd only have one configuration of V8 that always includes i18n

[11:18:37.0321] <Richard Gibson>
the version of Moddable XS fetched by esvu at least correctly supports both the above toUpperCase()/toLowerCase() behavior and `/…/u` regular expressions with `\p{<property name>}` contents

[02:09:36.0398] <canadahonk>
just wondering, are tests for some stage 2/3 proposals missing just because no one has created them yet or are there other reasons?

[02:13:46.0748] <ptomato>
just because no one has created them yet

[02:17:47.0176] <canadahonk>
also, docs (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) say "stage 3" but there's also stage 2 features so is that not really a restriction (now)?

[02:21:14.0442] <ptomato>
it's still a restriction; folks are welcome to write tests for stage 2 proposals but generally we keep them as open unmerged PRs

[02:21:39.0584] <ptomato>
there are some that are merged, but I believe those are proposals that were previously stage 3 and got reverted

[02:21:58.0108] <canadahonk>
makes sense, thanks!

related making harness depend less on modern features - I found that Rhino have issues just for these cases which might be helpful: https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22test262+harness%22 (cc linusg)

question for shu / other implementers: right now the TypedArray tests are almost all generic across all of the TypedArray types, including stuff like Atomics which are tested against every TA type. if I just add Float16Array to that list it's going to cause every one of those tests to fail. that seems undesirable for implementers. do you have thoughts?

[14:04:16.0352] <bakkot>
the list is just defined in code, so in principle I could conditionally add Float16Array based on whether it exists as a global, I guess, and then have other tests explicitly for Float16Array which would use a feature flag


2023-06-12
[20:56:39.0612] <ljharb>
What was done when the bigint arrays were added?

[21:10:47.0581] <bakkot>
those tests basically were not updated

[21:10:59.0437] <bakkot>
that does make some sense because it's harder to be generic over those

[21:11:43.0213] <bakkot>
it's split into https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/c4642dd714175b5d27939c920abc6059c9fddb06/harness/testTypedArray.js and https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/c4642dd714175b5d27939c920abc6059c9fddb06/harness/testBigIntTypedArray.js

[21:48:56.0783] <ljharb>
ok

[21:49:05.0813] <ljharb>
should there be a testFloat16TypedArray.js, to follow the pattern?

[21:49:14.0440] <ljharb>
or should the bigint ones be conditionally merged into testTypedArray?

[21:50:29.0233] <bakkot>
if you look at how testFloat16TypedArray.js works, that can't really be a thing - everything consumer would need to be updated, which is strictly more work than just writing manual tests in the first place

[21:50:56.0538] <bakkot>
the bigint ones can't quite really go in testTypedArray because most of the consumers assume that TAs contain Numbers

[02:42:36.0685] <ptomato>
one idea might be to have a separate harness file that appends `Float16Array` into the `floatArrayConstructors` array that's defined by `testTypedArray.js`?

[02:43:45.0281] <ptomato>
that way you could do `includes: [testTypedArray.js, testFloat16TypedArray.js]` and `features: [Float16Array]` in your test, and it would Just Work; although it would run all the other typed array tests twice, I guess

[02:44:09.0924] <ptomato>
the "push if global is available" solution seems reasonable as well, though

[02:44:39.0552] <ptomato>
as long as we have tests that verify the global is actually there

[09:22:28.0675] <bakkot>
yeah I will write separate tests which use the feature flag and test Float16Array-specific stuff

[09:22:33.0078] <bakkot>
rounding behavior at the very least

[10:21:32.0955] <canadahonk>
is there an official like "test262 es2020"/etc? I see things like it thrown around a bit but can't find anything

[10:24:40.0263] <ptomato>
as in, run test262 on all the feature set of es2020? I don't think that exists, but there might be one I'm not aware of

[10:43:22.0861] <canadahonk>
yeah I saw some (niche-r) engines say like "passing 80% of test262 es2020"

[10:43:32.0042] <canadahonk>
 * yeah I saw some (niche-r) engines say like "passing 80% of test262 es2020". guessing they just select some dirs

[10:46:48.0897] <bakkot>
if I were them I would check out a commit at a particular point in time and use that

[11:06:00.0833] <canadahonk>
fwiw I checked their runner source, it looks like they tie each feature flag to a rough ES version

[11:06:22.0998] <canadahonk>
 * fwiw I checked their runner source, it looks like they tie each feature flag to a rough ES version (https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/main/boa_tester/src/edition.rs)

ah neat!

maintainers, how do you feel about merging iterator helpers tests? https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2818

[01:49:43.0019] <ptomato>
I'm OK with it\

[09:54:07.0300] <ljharb>
i'm ok with it too - i can rerun them against my polyfill first, later today too

[09:54:09.0030] <ljharb>
 * i'm ok with it too - i can rerun them against my polyfill first, later today

[10:22:09.0065] <shu>
ptomato: i would prefer it to be merged

causing every one of those tests to fail is undesirable because the granularity of V8's runner, and i suspect most engines' runners, isn't at that level. if we update expectations to `FAIL` then we're not going to detect regressions in other TAs until F16Arrays land

[10:23:32.0075] <ptomato>
oh yeah I didn't mean there's any question about it, but I meant more like have folks done all the reviews they wanted

[10:23:37.0416] <shu>
but it sounds like you settled on a more granular approach anyways?

[10:23:41.0043] <shu>
ptomato: oh yes, V8 has

[10:25:04.0764] <shu>
bakkot: ideally we keep test granularity at file level and avoid having polymorphic tests; i know test262 already has capability to generate tests from sources

[10:27:20.0020] <bakkot>
yeah the conditional push will at least prevent failures

[10:27:30.0510] <bakkot>
in theory

[10:27:35.0151] <bakkot>
you can run https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3849 if you want to be sure

[10:27:48.0032] <bakkot>
(which does not include any Float16Array-specific tests yet)

[10:28:00.0942] <bakkot>
agreed that generating these from templates would be better but that's a lot of work

[10:28:25.0347] <bakkot>
and gpt is not yet quite good enough to do that for me

[10:28:29.0991] <bakkot>
maybe next year

[10:30:47.0187] <shu>
yeah conditional push sgtm

https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3854

[15:05:07.0088] <canadahonk>
is https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/3461 still an issue btw?


2023-06-15
[01:14:03.0406] <ptomato>
I don't think anyone fixed it yet

[07:46:39.0062] <shu>
ptomato: would you like to do the honors of pressing the button on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/2818?

[07:49:47.0703] <ptomato>
sure, I think there's been ample opportunity for anyone to say "hold up, I still want to review this"

[07:50:05.0680] <ptomato>
I'm going to squash the commits, unless there are any in there that seem like they ought to be kept separate?

[07:52:11.0865] <shu>
🎉

[11:16:01.0075] <shu>
we missed a test that needed the iterator-helpers feature flag: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3855

[11:16:05.0100] <shu>
can someone merge that rq?

[11:18:42.0772] <shu>
ty

[13:43:58.0298] <ljharb>
i split up that file in https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3856
