reminder, next week Jihyeok Park from ESMeta would like to join our call

[13:40:29.0322] <ptomato>
I was thinking of sending an email to that thread on what to expect

[13:40:47.0866] <ptomato>
just so they don't spend time preparing an hour-long presentation if that's not what we're looking for, or something like that

[13:41:09.0807] <ptomato>
any thoughts from this group on what we are looking for?

[13:41:55.0343] <ptomato>
for me I'm interested in the process they have in mind for getting ESMeta and test262 to work together

[13:42:41.0737] <ptomato>
things like, do we require all PRs to pass the tests when ESMeta runs them?

[13:42:53.0196] <ptomato>
if there are discrepancies, who is on the hook for investigating?

[13:43:06.0727] <ptomato>
what do we do with proposals that aren't in ESMeta yet?

[13:43:41.0318] <ptomato>
let me know and I can reply to the thread

[16:09:49.0887] <ljharb>
those all sound like good questions

I've sent the email; I think the maintainers group is copied on it anyway

[11:26:30.0028] <jugglinmike>
I received it!

[15:47:47.0210] <shu>
some hopefully trivial 1-liner fixes if anyone's around: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3700 and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3701

[15:51:53.0664] <ptomato>
done. I asked the authors of the toSpliced test to weigh in on what the intention was

[15:51:54.0892] <ptomato>
thanks!

[16:12:32.0165] <shu>
thanks for the quick reply

anyone else planning to join the meeting today?

[12:02:52.0077] <Richard Gibson>
oh my gosh, I can't believe I was off by an hour

[12:03:11.0407] <Richard Gibson>
ðŸ¤¦

[12:44:19.0290] <ptomato>
oh, dang, I didn't realize when you said you'd be a bit later at the meeting, you meant 1 hour later at what you thought was the appointed time. otherwise I'd have said something, sorry!

here's a google sheets date picker - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17F7yzfRfrGAerVqIuadEYwOAW9L61ToWxfK1svH5s7s/edit#gid=0

[16:14:14.0626] <ptomato>
I've started out from the assumption that the current meeting time of 20:00 is too late for Ms2ger, and anything before 06:00 is too early for me, so that leaves a span of 5 hours - unfortunately none of which are ideal for my colleague Aditi who is interested in getting involved. this is probably going to be a "least worst" situation
