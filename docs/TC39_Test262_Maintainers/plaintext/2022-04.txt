Hi friends! I will be out again this Thursday (doin' art) and so I will miss the call again. I took a look at the notes, and I agree the RFC process makes sense. 

I need to look at our derivative RFC of course to see if there a few things I'd change, but generally seems like a good plan. I trust Philip to represent for everything else, and I look back to being on a call with you all soon.
