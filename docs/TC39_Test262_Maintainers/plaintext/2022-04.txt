Hi friends! I will be out again this Thursday (doin' art) and so I will miss the call again. I took a look at the notes, and I agree the RFC process makes sense. 

I need to look at our derivative RFC of course to see if there a few things I'd change, but generally seems like a good plan. I trust Philip to represent for everything else, and I look back to being on a call with you all soon.

something I forgot to put on the agenda this morning, re https://github.com/tc39/Admin-and-Business/issues/216, is it significant which ECMA member is Mike's official sponsor or do we just need to arbitrarily pick Salesforce or Igalia?

i don't think it's significant; i think ecma just needs to write something into field on their form

any chance we could add a test feature for "IsConstructor checks"? basically all of them use `parseInt` as a canonical non-constructor function, but when testing all my polyfills, a) i shim parseInt, and b) non-constructor-ness can't be shimmed, so i'd like to skip all such tests.

i'd be happy to make the PR if that's the kind of feature flag that's acceptable :-)

[08:57:58.0306] <ptomato>
that is a problem that I've heard other polyfills having as well

[09:02:34.0277] <Richard Gibson>
What do you mean by "basically all of them use parseInt as a canonical non-constructor function"? I see only minimal overlap:

```sh
$ git grep -l isConstructor '*.js' | xargs grep -l parseInt
test/built-ins/Number/parseInt/not-a-constructor.js
test/built-ins/parseInt/not-a-constructor.js
```

I'm also not sure what you mean by "can't be shimmed", because neither arrow functions nor those returned by `Function.prototype.call.bind(fn)` are \[\[Construct\]\]able (although in both cases access to the receiver is lost, so maybe that's the problem?).

Regardless, it does seem reasonable to have a feature flag for the checks, but doesn't it already exist as `Reflect.construct`?

```sh
$ git grep -l isConstructor test/ | \
  xargs sed -n '/^features:/,/^---/ { s/[*][/]$//; p }' | \
  python3 -c "$(printf 'import sys,yaml\nfor doc in yaml.safe_load_all(sys.stdin):\n if doc:\n  print("\x1F".join(doc["features"]))\n')" | \
  awk 'BEGIN { FS="\x1F" } { for(i=1; i<=NF; i++) m[$i]++; } END { for(flag in m) print m[flag], flag; print NR, "TOTAL" }' | \
  sort -n | \

[09:04:00.0265] <ljharb>
bound functions are constructible, and arrows can‚Äôt be made in polyfills that support older engines

[09:04:22.0625] <ljharb>
indeed ‚Äúall‚Äù may have been an exaggeration, but there‚Äôs a bunch in other filenames - species things, eg

[09:04:54.0923] <ljharb>
I‚Äôd be happy to use Reflect.construct as the feature flag for those missing it, but that seems specific to that reflect method, versus a generic ‚Äúnon-constructibles‚Äù thing

[09:07:15.0847] <Richard Gibson>
bound functions in general can be constructible, but those returned by `Function.prototype.call.bind(‚Ä¶)` are not because `Function.prototype.call` is not

[09:10:32.0092] <Richard Gibson>
but at any rate, it is true that the `Reflect.construct` feature is used for more than just isConstructor checks

[09:13:08.0135] <ljharb>
ooh, good point. perhaps test262 could use call instead of parseint as its non-constructible? nothing ever tries to shim call

[09:13:19.0986] <ljharb>
that would immediately make a bunch of currently failing tests start passing for me

[09:15:58.0421] <Richard Gibson>
what do you mean by "as its non-constructible"‚Äîwhere do you want a switch from `parseInt` to `call`?

[09:31:31.0156] <Richard Gibson>
looking at the 164 test files that include `Reflect.construct` but not `isConstructor` (`git grep -lF 'Reflect.construct' test/ | grep -vF "$(git grep -l isConstructor test/)"`), I retract my implication that the `Reflect.construct` flag covers this

[09:32:04.0268] <Richard Gibson>

[09:43:48.0929] <Richard Gibson>
but I think I would expect a maximally faithful polyfill to shim like `parseInt = bind(call, myParseInt)` rather than `parseInt = myParseInt` in order to ensure absence of [[Construct]]

[09:54:46.0030] <ptomato>
I think Jordan's point is that you can't do that if your polyfill targets certain obsolete environments

[10:06:28.0152] <ljharb>
^ that

[10:06:41.0709] <ljharb>
namely, every browser pre-arrow-functions. all my stuff still targets IE 6

> <@gibson042:matrix.org> but I think I would expect a maximally faithful polyfill to shim like `parseInt = bind(call, myParseInt)` rather than `parseInt = myParseInt` in order to ensure absence of [[Construct]]

a shim has to provide a *new* function, so it can't just bind the original. also, ES3 doesn't have `.bind`.

[10:56:52.0807] <Richard Gibson>
ES3 doesn't have `Reflect` either, so the test262 code at https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/harness/isConstructor.js won't recognize _anything_ as constructible in such an environment. So to elaborate a bit, I think I would expect a maximally faithful ES3-compatible polyfill to shim like

```js
/*globalThis.*/parseInt = asNonConstructible(myParseInt);
‚Ä¶
function myParseInt(string, radix) { ‚Ä¶ }
‚Ä¶
function asNonConstructible(fn) {
  if (nativeBind) {
    // bind(nativeCall, fn) uses a derivatives of Function.prototype.bind with uncurried receiver
    // to provide a robust version of Function.prototype.call.bind(fn)
    // (i.e., returning a bound function that lacks [[Construct]] and calls fn with undefined receiver).
    return bind(nativeCall, fn);
  }

  // In the absence of Function.prototype.bind, fall back to returning the provided function.
  return fn;
}
```

[12:14:40.0288] <ljharb>
interesting

[12:15:10.0933] <ljharb>
but in the meantime i'd still want to skip those tests, and there's a bunch of `create-species-non-ctor.js` files that aren't easily skippable

[12:30:10.0881] <ptomato>
another option in the meantime could be to maintain an "expected failures" file that you use when reporting your test results

[12:30:21.0871] <ptomato>
it'd be annoying to update it manually, but maybe there's some way to generate it
