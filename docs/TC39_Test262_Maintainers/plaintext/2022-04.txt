Hi friends! I will be out again this Thursday (doin' art) and so I will miss the call again. I took a look at the notes, and I agree the RFC process makes sense. 

I need to look at our derivative RFC of course to see if there a few things I'd change, but generally seems like a good plan. I trust Philip to represent for everything else, and I look back to being on a call with you all soon.

something I forgot to put on the agenda this morning, re https://github.com/tc39/Admin-and-Business/issues/216, is it significant which ECMA member is Mike's official sponsor or do we just need to arbitrarily pick Salesforce or Igalia?

i don't think it's significant; i think ecma just needs to write something into field on their form

Followup from the meeting. Since we have mostly meaty topics left and I am going to be away next week, should we make next week an async / work on issues meeting and reconvene Thursday May 5?

‚ûï yes
üò≠ no I will miss everyone

any chance we could add a test feature for "IsConstructor checks"? basically all of them use `parseInt` as a canonical non-constructor function, but when testing all my polyfills, a) i shim parseInt, and b) non-constructor-ness can't be shimmed, so i'd like to skip all such tests.

i'd be happy to make the PR if that's the kind of feature flag that's acceptable :-)
