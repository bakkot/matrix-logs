Hi friends! I will be out again this Thursday (doin' art) and so I will miss the call again. I took a look at the notes, and I agree the RFC process makes sense. 

I need to look at our derivative RFC of course to see if there a few things I'd change, but generally seems like a good plan. I trust Philip to represent for everything else, and I look back to being on a call with you all soon.

something I forgot to put on the agenda this morning, re https://github.com/tc39/Admin-and-Business/issues/216, is it significant which ECMA member is Mike's official sponsor or do we just need to arbitrarily pick Salesforce or Igalia?

sorry for missing yesterday, I got pulled into a conflicting meeting

i don't think it's significant; i think ecma just needs to write something into field on their form

any reason not to remove the graaljs job from CI? it seems to be consistently broken

I saw that it's passing now

@room just a heads up that I cannot attend today's meeting and I'm out on PTO tomorrow

[09:53:33.0017] <Rick Waldron>
Please have meeting without me and I will catch up via notes

Followup from the meeting. Since we have mostly meaty topics left and I am going to be away next week, should we make next week an async / work on issues meeting and reconvene Thursday May 5?

‚ûï yes
üò≠ no I will miss everyone

any chance we could add a test feature for "IsConstructor checks"? basically all of them use `parseInt` as a canonical non-constructor function, but when testing all my polyfills, a) i shim parseInt, and b) non-constructor-ness can't be shimmed, so i'd like to skip all such tests.

i'd be happy to make the PR if that's the kind of feature flag that's acceptable :-)

[08:57:58.0306] <ptomato>
that is a problem that I've heard other polyfills having as well

[09:02:34.0277] <Richard Gibson>
What do you mean by "basically all of them use parseInt as a canonical non-constructor function"? I see only minimal overlap:

```sh
$ git grep -l isConstructor '*.js' | xargs grep -l parseInt
test/built-ins/Number/parseInt/not-a-constructor.js
test/built-ins/parseInt/not-a-constructor.js
```

I'm also not sure what you mean by "can't be shimmed", because neither arrow functions nor those returned by `Function.prototype.call.bind(fn)` are \[\[Construct\]\]able (although in both cases access to the receiver is lost, so maybe that's the problem?).

Regardless, it does seem reasonable to have a feature flag for the checks, but doesn't it already exist as `Reflect.construct`?

```sh
$ git grep -l isConstructor test/ | \
  xargs sed -n '/^features:/,/^---/ { s/[*][/]$//; p }' | \
  python3 -c "$(printf 'import sys,yaml\nfor doc in yaml.safe_load_all(sys.stdin):\n if doc:\n  print("\x1F".join(doc["features"]))\n')" | \
  awk 'BEGIN { FS="\x1F" } { for(i=1; i<=NF; i++) m[$i]++; } END { for(flag in m) print m[flag], flag; print NR, "TOTAL" }' | \
  sort -n | \

16 Symbol

bound functions are constructible, and arrows can‚Äôt be made in polyfills that support older engines

[09:04:22.0625] <ljharb>
indeed ‚Äúall‚Äù may have been an exaggeration, but there‚Äôs a bunch in other filenames - species things, eg

[09:04:54.0923] <ljharb>
I‚Äôd be happy to use Reflect.construct as the feature flag for those missing it, but that seems specific to that reflect method, versus a generic ‚Äúnon-constructibles‚Äù thing

[09:07:15.0847] <Richard Gibson>
bound functions in general can be constructible, but those returned by `Function.prototype.call.bind(‚Ä¶)` are not because `Function.prototype.call` is not
