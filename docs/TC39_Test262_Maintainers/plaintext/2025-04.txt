can I get a quick review of https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4449 (updates some non-JS linting/CI infrastructure)?

I guess we have the keys to eshost now? does anyone feel qualified to review this? https://github.com/tc39/eshost/pull/139

(and maybe we should go over the open PRs, merge any that make sense, and make a release. I see most of them are from dependabot)

ðŸ¥³

review also requested for https://github.com/tc39/eshost/pull/138

[13:12:29.0791] <ptomato>
thought I'd previously reviewed that one!

I couldn't review it because I couldn't get Hermes for me locally

[13:17:30.0057] <ryzokuken>
but I can hit merge now ðŸ˜„
