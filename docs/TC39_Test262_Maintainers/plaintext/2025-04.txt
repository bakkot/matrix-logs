can I get a quick review of https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4449 (updates some non-JS linting/CI infrastructure)?

I guess we have the keys to eshost now? does anyone feel qualified to review this? https://github.com/tc39/eshost/pull/139

[12:23:31.0542] <ptomato>
(and maybe we should go over the open PRs, merge any that make sense, and make a release. I see most of them are from dependabot)

ðŸ¥³

review also requested for https://github.com/tc39/eshost/pull/138

[13:12:29.0791] <ptomato>
thought I'd previously reviewed that one!

[13:17:17.0819] <ryzokuken>
I couldn't review it because I couldn't get Hermes for me locally

[13:17:30.0057] <ryzokuken>
but I can hit merge now ðŸ˜„

I wrote rudimentary support for boa in eshost: https://github.com/tc39/eshost/pull/147

I presented [this deck](https://ptomato.name/talks/tc39-2025-04/#8) in TG2 a few months ago and I thought I'd put it on the agenda for this upcoming TG1. seems relevant now in light of https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4447

since I mentioned the testing plan guidance in the plenary today, I think we should rescue it from review oblivion and merge it. Ioanna doesn't really have time to work on it right now so I fixed the typos and added a callout to it in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. please have a look https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4113

do staging tests count for proposals? i suspect not

[16:25:51.0225] <shu>
for stage 3 yes

[16:25:52.0279] <shu>
for stage 4 no

why would they count differently?

[21:51:50.0049] <ljharb>
the whole point of 2.7 is that's when the tests go in, and things in staging aren't ready to be ran across engines, that's the whole point of the reduced review requirement as i understand it

[21:52:07.0069] <ljharb>
iow i don't see how "sufficient testing" can be satisfied with anything in staging

[05:01:15.0607] <Ms2ger>
Staging is very much intended to be run across engines

[07:24:32.0059] <shu>
the whole point of staging is to run across engines

[07:24:46.0897] <shu>
we've discussed this in the past when clarifying staging, like you and i specifically jordan
