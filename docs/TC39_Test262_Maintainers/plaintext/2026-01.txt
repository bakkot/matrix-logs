Hi everyone, after a bit over a year of absence I now have the opportunity to spend more time on being a maintainer, and I plan to start reviewing and joining the maintainers meetings again.

Explicit Resource Management is still on the cusp of Stage 4, pending some final items:

The following PRs are still waiting on approval (ptomato is waiting on a response from Richard Gibson, ljharb, or Ms2ger):
- https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4482
- https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4480

The following PR is still awaiting review:
- https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4478

This has been held up for 8 months now waiting on reviews.

I also will not have time to review, and would be okay with landing based on arai's review

Is the Immutable Arraybuffer proposal also conditionally advanced to Stage 3, but still pending testing approval? I think in the future we should be more cautious about conditional advancement based upon tests landing, this doesn't seem to be a good situation for proposal champions or test262 maintainers.

👋 please lmk who will be presenting the update at plenary next week and timebox required

[10:46:04.0351] <ptomato>
I don't think there's actually anything to report since last time. I can improvise something in 2 minutes if necessary

[10:56:56.0233] <Chris de Almeida>
it's not necessary -- we can skip

ptomato: I applied your suggestions. How's this look now? https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4648

[09:58:57.0017] <ptomato>
that looks fine, I left another comment in a different test. thanks!

[10:20:21.0864] <rbuckton>
Who needs to make a final decision on #4482 and #4480?

[10:32:34.0037] <ptomato>
ugh, I'll just merge it now, sorry

[10:33:33.0222] <ptomato>
I think we left plenty of time to shout if anyone disagreed

[10:41:26.0095] <rbuckton>
It looks like all we need is a review on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4478 now. IIRC, the only major blocker for the ecma262 PR was specifying Async built-in functions, which was mentioned in this weeks plenary, so aside from hopefully minor cleanup in that PR, #4478 would be the last blocker for Stage 4. I'd appreciate if someone can find time to review before the March plenary.
