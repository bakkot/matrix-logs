So, concretely, can I ask for Stage 3 for upsert when https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4454 merges, or should I subsequently open one or more PRs to move them into normal test262?

I'm asking because I'd like to put a Stage 3 advancement item on the agenda for the next plenary if possible, and I'm not sure what the next steps are and if I have enough time to get everything pulled together by then.

it is my understanding that staging suffices for stage 3

[10:54:39.0930] <shu>
and also if there is disagreement in committee i will fight hard for it to suffice

i disagree on that

[20:56:16.0162] <ljharb>
to clarify: certainly tests in staging *might* be up to snuff, but the whole point of staging was to allow subpar tests to go in with minimal to no review, for the purpose of sharing, which isn't the point of the process requirement as i understand it.
