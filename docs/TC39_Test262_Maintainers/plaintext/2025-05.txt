So, concretely, can I ask for Stage 3 for upsert when https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4454 merges, or should I subsequently open one or more PRs to move them into normal test262?

I'm asking because I'd like to put a Stage 3 advancement item on the agenda for the next plenary if possible, and I'm not sure what the next steps are and if I have enough time to get everything pulled together by then.

it is my understanding that staging suffices for stage 3

[10:54:39.0930] <shu>
and also if there is disagreement in committee i will fight hard for it to suffice
