I reviewed the above

[12:00:52.0065] <ptomato>
as well, I reviewed import.defer tests https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4374 and https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4375 - they've been sitting around for a while so I assume no one has time for additional reviews on them, but shout soon if you want me to wait on merging them

[12:44:30.0254] <ptomato>
same goes for https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4350 now that it's been fixed up, so shout if you want me to wait past the end of today
