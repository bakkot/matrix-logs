looks like our contributor who wrote the fix for the regex escape tests needs a bit of help upstreaming this to the tool that generated those tests: https://github.com/bocoup/test262-regexp-generator/pull/2

that repo is owned by Bocoup. does anyone know if it makes sense to transfer it to TC39? cc jugglinmike

(or even move the tool into the test262 repo)

I like this idea best; there's no need for it to be an external dependency IMO
