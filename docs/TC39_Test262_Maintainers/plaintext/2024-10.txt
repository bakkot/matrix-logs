jugglinmike: I was wondering if y'all are still maintaining https://github.com/bocoup/test262-stream , or would perhaps be willing to transfer to tc39 as well?

ptomato: hm, i clicked on a future notes doc link to try to get to the summary, and i didn't have access. i requested it, but could someone dump the status update points in here just in case?

[18:07:15.0978] <ptomato>
ljharb: here it is:
- All of the resizable ArrayBuffer tests have been ported out of staging.
- Working on reviewing the 400+ tests for explicit resource management
- Atomics.pause has test coverage.


[18:07:30.0979] <ptomato>
doc is this one; I sure hope you have access https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JRG6FeYmZIievBPpAdvJjDhfsEjRrdzsFPTYG86KSmM/edit?tab=t.0

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1de1xchd6LoHJcD2khovoxbeNlxEygO6VPPFARm8tqPM/edit?usp=meetingnotes&showmeetingnotespromo=true is the one i don't have access to, there's 2 docs linked on the calendar event

[18:08:44.0577] <ptomato>
I don't have access to that either. not sure if I ever did

[18:08:57.0687] <ljharb>
k, i'll clean that up later

i'd love to go for stage 3 next plenary, so the sooner https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4266 can be landed, the better :-) consider this a shameless plug for reviews

[10:35:00.0538] <ptomato>
only 12 files, should be doable üòÑ

[10:35:24.0620] <ptomato>
ljharb: did we have a testing plan for this one? OTOH, the proposal is probably small enough that it's not necessary

[10:35:34.0183] <ljharb>
no, and yes i think it is

[10:37:27.0567] <ptomato>
I am looking at the proposal now and I agree
