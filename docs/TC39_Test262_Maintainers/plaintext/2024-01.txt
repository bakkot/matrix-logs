Should spec changes or their accompanying tests land first?

[02:47:18.0275] <ryzokuken>
tests first from what I remember 

[06:07:57.0164] <littledan>
I think “at roughly the same time” is good enough

[09:52:03.0145] <bakkot>
for proposals, things can't land without getting stage 4, can't get stage 4 without shipping implementations, and at least Chrome is reluctant to ship without tests having landed in test262 (e.g. https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3966#issuecomment-1828779758 )

[09:52:11.0484] <bakkot>
so tests have to land first for the process to work for proposals

[09:52:33.0229] <shu>
not just reluctant, we won't

[09:52:52.0512] <shu>
 * not just reluctant, we won't ship any web visible features (JS or otherwise) without interopable tests (test262 or wpt)

[10:03:53.0712] <ljharb>
i'd say tests should generally land first, since there's a lag after that before implementations follow them
