Should spec changes or their accompanying tests land first?

[02:47:18.0275] <ryzokuken>
tests first from what I remember 

[06:07:57.0164] <littledan>
I think “at roughly the same time” is good enough

[09:52:03.0145] <bakkot>
for proposals, things can't land without getting stage 4, can't get stage 4 without shipping implementations, and at least Chrome is reluctant to ship without tests having landed in test262 (e.g. https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3966#issuecomment-1828779758 )

[09:52:11.0484] <bakkot>
so tests have to land first for the process to work for proposals

[09:52:33.0229] <shu>
not just reluctant, we won't

[09:52:52.0512] <shu>
 * not just reluctant, we won't ship any web visible features (JS or otherwise) without interopable tests (test262 or wpt)

[10:03:53.0712] <ljharb>
i'd say tests should generally land first, since there's a lag after that before implementations follow them

[14:41:24.0421] <littledan>
sorry I meant, I'm happy with tests landing first, but if they're both ready at the same time, it's fine to be sloppy about it (we have been in the past)

[14:44:50.0931] <bakkot>
also, what's the policy on when things are ready to land? the set methods PR has a stamp from ljharb but I don't know if it requires additional reviews or what

[15:08:23.0935] <ptomato>
I don't think we have a specific policy on that. I know Jordan prefers 2 stamps

[15:10:24.0574] <ptomato>
about Set methods specifically, IIRC Jordan's last review covered everything except `*class*.js` — or have those been looked at in the meantime
