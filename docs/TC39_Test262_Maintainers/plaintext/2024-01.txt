Should spec changes or their accompanying tests land first?

[02:47:18.0275] <ryzokuken>
tests first from what I remember 

[06:07:57.0164] <littledan>
I think “at roughly the same time” is good enough

[09:52:03.0145] <bakkot>
for proposals, things can't land without getting stage 4, can't get stage 4 without shipping implementations, and at least Chrome is reluctant to ship without tests having landed in test262 (e.g. https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3966#issuecomment-1828779758 )

[09:52:11.0484] <bakkot>
so tests have to land first for the process to work for proposals

[09:52:33.0229] <shu>
not just reluctant, we won't

[09:52:52.0512] <shu>
 * not just reluctant, we won't ship any web visible features (JS or otherwise) without interopable tests (test262 or wpt)

[10:03:53.0712] <ljharb>
i'd say tests should generally land first, since there's a lag after that before implementations follow them

[14:41:24.0421] <littledan>
sorry I meant, I'm happy with tests landing first, but if they're both ready at the same time, it's fine to be sloppy about it (we have been in the past)

[14:44:50.0931] <bakkot>
also, what's the policy on when things are ready to land? the set methods PR has a stamp from ljharb but I don't know if it requires additional reviews or what

[15:08:23.0935] <ptomato>
I don't think we have a specific policy on that. I know Jordan prefers 2 stamps

[15:10:24.0574] <ptomato>
about Set methods specifically, IIRC Jordan's last review covered everything except `*class*.js` — or have those been looked at in the meantime

More reviews seems ideal, if it doesn’t slow down velocity. Does it end up slowing things down to wait for two?

[16:55:43.0893] <shu>
V8 has been waiting to ship Set methods pending test262 for a while

[16:55:54.0789] <shu>
we would've just dumped more stuff into staging but since they were already written and pending review, we waited

[16:56:31.0783] <shu>
we are in a similar boat with regexp modifiers, i think. Ron has a PR open

[16:58:06.0722] <littledan>
Do the things awaiting landing have one favorable review?

[16:58:52.0782] <shu>
going by the checkmarks alone, the set methods PR has one from ljharb 

[16:59:02.0563] <shu>
regexp modifiers have none: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3960

[16:59:24.0080] <littledan>
I don’t think it is the end of the world if a test bug lands; it can be noticed later and fixed. Actually landing tests can help bugs get noticed faster (because engines run them)

[16:59:49.0131] <littledan>
So one review might be enough if it’s delaying things 

[17:00:57.0738] <shu>
we could make `{v8,jsc,sm} shipping blocker` label if reviewers are amenable to using that info to prioritize

[17:01:57.0112] <shu>
where the label means, "the only thing remaining to ship the feature is test262 tests"

[20:02:28.0476] <ljharb>
if someone reviews the class tests (only) I’d be fine with landing it, i just haven’t looked at them

[20:02:50.0025] <ljharb>
* if someone reviews the class tests (only) I’d be fine with landing it, i just haven’t looked at them (for set methods)

[08:27:34.0002] <ptomato>
I'll try to take a look at those soon. I reviewed the class tests for `difference` and `intersection` already, I doubt the others are much different

did chakracore magically start working in the CI again, or did one of you fix it?
