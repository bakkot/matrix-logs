anyone around to stamp this? https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4368

[16:01:58.0884] <shu>
having tests that aren't supposed to be run ending in `.mjs` is tripping up v8's test262 runner

thanks

what is this auto-merge thing, how do i actually merge it?

[17:38:44.0434] <ljharb>
i think it's supposed to do it for you? doesn't matter tho, you merged it and that's fine

[17:39:09.0055] <ljharb>
(it would be ideal to keep the .mjs extension tho, even if it has the _FIXTURE, but it's staging so nbd)

[19:08:31.0657] <shu>
there isn't any .mjs extension in test262 currently

[19:08:54.0578] <ljharb>
fair enough, but i'd prefer we use that for Module code

[19:12:39.0117] <shu>
that's fine. i'd prefer to do it intentionally over the whole repo instead of adhoc, then i can update the test runner accordingly

[19:16:35.0279] <ljharb>
reasonable

Can you please tag me on changes to staging/sm?
