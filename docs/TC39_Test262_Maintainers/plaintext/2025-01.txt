anyone around to stamp this? https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4368

[16:01:58.0884] <shu>
having tests that aren't supposed to be run ending in `.mjs` is tripping up v8's test262 runner

[16:15:34.0922] <shu>
thanks

what is this auto-merge thing, how do i actually merge it?

[17:38:44.0434] <ljharb>
i think it's supposed to do it for you? doesn't matter tho, you merged it and that's fine

[17:39:09.0055] <ljharb>
(it would be ideal to keep the .mjs extension tho, even if it has the _FIXTURE, but it's staging so nbd)

[19:08:31.0657] <shu>
there isn't any .mjs extension in test262 currently

[19:08:54.0578] <ljharb>
fair enough, but i'd prefer we use that for Module code

[19:12:39.0117] <shu>
that's fine. i'd prefer to do it intentionally over the whole repo instead of adhoc, then i can update the test runner accordingly

[19:16:35.0279] <ljharb>
reasonable

[01:20:33.0798] <Ms2ger>
Can you please tag me on changes to staging/sm?

Anyone attending the meeting?

https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4350 is blocking implementations of the upstream normative change; can it get prioritized? it's pretty straightforward I think

[15:31:00.0401] <ptomato>
we were just talking this morning in the maintainers meeting about how bandwidth is limited at the moment, so we'll try to prioritize things that are blocking or urgent. this seems like a good one to prioritize
