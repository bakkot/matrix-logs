the vast majority are Date ones; one pair is "parseInt.prototype isn't undefined" because that's not shimmable; another pair is unavoidable AggregateError constructor hijinx; and then a few scattered others

Awesome! I haven't looked at the other failures, but for parseInt, the `asNonConstructible` of https://matrix.to/#/!dGIsaFIukRWLdpurvh:matrix.org/$fvGRXxCTo23zwsh5a2s7KyK_ZHFuYv0msf3o2YmKEDE?via=matrix.org also takes care of making the prototype undefined in environments supporting Function.prototype.bind.
