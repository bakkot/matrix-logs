good point; I thought bumping the version would be overkill since I got the impression that it's only a problem with 1.2.8. see https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3628

[14:07:15.0535] <ptomato>
can anyone rubberstamp https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3629 ? these are tests by Anba that I already reviewed

> <@pchimento:igalia.com> Ms2ger was coincidentally thinking along those lines a few weeks ago and did an experiment with porting the old tests to use the test262 assertions: https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3591/files

following up on this - I'd like to put these unformatted Temporal tests by Ms2ger into staging, and my colleague Aditi would like to follow up with some more of them. would anyone mind if I just created the `test/staging/` dir in the repo in advance of the access controls, and moved the tests in that PR into that dir? (instead of `test/built-ins/Temporal/Instant/old/`)

@room I cannot attend today's meeting. 

[08:15:01.0390] <Rick Waldron>
I will read notes as soon as I have a chance. 

[11:03:01.0608] <ljharb>
seems like i'm the only one here

[11:03:51.0505] <ptomato>
3 of us are waiting in another call, https://meet.jit.si/Test262MaintainersCallParty

[11:04:02.0800] <ljharb>
oh hm, my event had a meet on it

[11:04:03.0307] <ljharb>
brt

[11:04:12.0859] <ptomato>
did we change the URL and one of us has the old one, or something

[11:04:14.0291] <ptomato>
oh, ok

[11:04:22.0398] <ljharb>
oh no nvm i just clicked the wrong event

[11:04:32.0500] <ptomato>
Richard Gibson: joining?

[11:04:39.0309] <ljharb>
i posted https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3635 ftr

[11:05:27.0440] <Richard Gibson>
thanks for the ping, this overlaps with ECMA-402 today and I lost track of time

[14:48:05.0116] <ptomato>
Rick Waldron: regrets acknowledged, we took copious notes especially for you 😄

[14:50:05.0961] <ptomato>
one of the things we talked about was to check if https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3464 was up to date with the latest normative changes to the change-array-by-copy proposal from the July plenary. I talked to the authors and it seems that it is. they're waiting for another round of review, so if you find time to look at it again, hopefully we can merge it

[15:04:42.0822] <ptomato>
here's a doodle for a new meeting time: https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/eZ4PD8vb


2022-08-10
[15:51:20.0010] <ptomato>
could I get a rubber stamp on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3630 ? rebasing it cancelled the reviews that were already there

[15:51:27.0548] <ptomato>
also don't forget to fill out the doodle!

[09:37:06.0045] <ljharb>
oof, those times are all super early morning for me (when i have conflicts)

[09:37:42.0205] <ljharb>
i only have two "maybe" times

[09:38:02.0725] <ljharb>

> <@ljharb:matrix.org> oof, those times are all super early morning for me (when i have conflicts)

do you have any other slots available in the West Coast/Europe overlapping zone that I didn't list? if there are slots not listed it's because I had a conflict, but I can try to move some of my stuff

[14:04:28.0195] <ljharb>
All the times are before 9am PT - i can do a bunch of times after that, but 7-9am is when i have childcare and the gym and whatnot

[14:07:19.0617] <ptomato>
after 9am PT it gets iffy for Ms2ger, unfortunately

[14:07:49.0841] <ptomato>
I wonder if we could alternate between an earlier and a later time


2022-08-16
[22:07:39.0394] <ljharb>
sure, it'd just likely mean that each meeting is only half-effective, with only a few overlappers :-/

[22:08:27.0022] <ljharb>
for things like this is usually like to use whenisgood.net, and then everyone can put in their times, and we can make a more informed decision - with doodles the creator gets to artificially restrict the options from the start

[09:38:23.0443] <ptomato>
I'll give that a try

[10:21:40.0865] <ljharb>

[18:04:05.0015] <ptomato>
I've created 
http://whenisgood.net/tdjsghn but I didn't have to enter a time zone anywhere - do people not in the Pacific time zone see the times in their time zones?


2022-08-22
[05:56:32.0621] <Ms2ger 💉💉>
ptomato: it shows 7am-6pm for me - are those the Pacific times you entered?


2022-08-23
[09:43:24.0888] <ptomato>
yep

[09:43:44.0260] <ptomato>
well, that's unfortunate if whenisgood only works for people in the same timezone 😛

[09:43:58.0913] <ptomato>
maybe I'm setting it up incorrectly

[10:41:15.0242] <ljharb>
lol yeah if it's not timezone-aware then that's not helpful

[10:48:01.0793] <ptomato>
anybody know any others that are timezone-aware but don't require you to click 50 time slots if you want a broad range of times 😛


2022-08-25
[11:07:35.0561] <ljharb>
there's just mike and i in the meeting now; anyone else coming?

[11:39:04.0372] <ptomato>
oh gosh, I'm sorry! I assumed we'd cancelled this time slot now

[11:39:39.0281] <ptomato>
did you discuss anything?

[12:23:33.0363] <Richard Gibson>
I thought I'd be able to make it today but an appointment ran very long

[14:30:17.0165] <ljharb>
nah just chatted


2022-08-31
[07:55:47.0691] <ptomato>
anybody able to approve https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3641 ? I thought Ms2ger was in the list of approvers, but apparently not

[08:20:38.0320] <ljharb>
Fixed the perms. That PR still needs CI to pass tho

[08:21:39.0024] <ptomato>
huh. I wonder why the CI jobs didn't start

[08:21:40.0449] <ptomato>
thanks

[08:28:35.0364] <ptomato>
did circleci recently deprecate an old configuration convention or something? see all the recent messages at https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/tc39/test262

[08:29:52.0890] <ptomato>
we have this file

[08:29:56.0774] <ljharb>
hm, the only change we made recently is removing Sarah from the org. Did she do the CI setup?

[08:30:35.0531] <ljharb>
(or rather from the test262 repo, not the org)

[08:31:03.0868] <ptomato>
no, it predates that

[08:31:19.0525] <ljharb>
ah k. (I’m also not sure why we haven’t migrated to github actions, but that’s a separate topic)

[08:31:59.0884] <ptomato>
it might even predate github actions 😛

[08:32:35.0124] <ljharb>
lolwut

[08:32:40.0758] <ljharb>
sounds like we need to contact them

[08:33:08.0354] <Ms2ger 💉💉>

[08:33:08.0959] <ljharb>
someone want to do that, and cc me on the email? i won’t have time til later today

[08:34:38.0739] <Ms2ger 💉💉>
I'll submit a ticket

[08:34:52.0885] <ptomato>
thanks Ms2ger

[08:37:08.0058] <Ms2ger 💉💉>
#116502

[08:37:47.0016] <ptomato>
can we look it up anywhere or was it just a form

[08:38:36.0398] <Ms2ger 💉💉>
Just a form

[08:56:05.0995] <Ms2ger 💉💉>
Seems fixed

[08:56:56.0492] <ptomato>
that was quick!

[08:57:27.0485] <Ms2ger 💉💉>
Definitely better than the 3-5 business days they promised

[09:00:31.0656] <ljharb>
wow

[09:06:36.0171] <ptomato>
did they say what the issue was?
