is today one of our meeting days?

[11:27:05.0217] <Rick Waldron>
What is our process for discussing proposals like this?

[11:27:10.0631] <Rick Waldron>
(Shu's proposal)

I think in the future it'd be ideal to use the RFC process for that, but also it seems like Shu basically already did the legwork that the RFC process requires

do we have a collective email alias for test262 maintainers?

[12:16:27.0247] <ptomato>
(that'll be easier than figuring out who wasn't included on the email from the ESMeta folks and what address they'd like it forwarded to)

[12:33:56.0908] <ljharb>
we don't, but we could make one

[12:38:11.0886] <ptomato>
alternatively Richard Gibson if you want to PM me your email address? I think I have everyone else's

[12:44:50.0917] <ptomato>
ok, you all should have an email forwarded by me, originally from Sukyoung Ryu, titled " ESMeta updates & recent issues/bugs in ECMA-262 and Test262"

could I get a rubber-stamp from any of you on https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/3606 ? this is for about 1/3 of the tests from Anba's giant PR that I've already reviewed
