How do I check whether someone has signed the Test262 CLA? (Do we check?)

[14:45:51.0523] <cjtenny>
Break into their house and sift through their filing cabinets

[14:46:00.0583] <cjtenny>
then, ask them?

[14:46:03.0518] <cjtenny>
(idk)

any test262 maintainers have a preference on testing strategy for https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3345?

[15:44:26.0284] <Michael Ficarra>
if not, I think I'm just going to embed a huge set of input-output pairs in a test and assert each of them

[15:45:21.0509] <Michael Ficarra>
probably a couple thousand random non-negative finite floats

if you can pick a few cases that you would know to be different if the sqrt was computed using, say, the approximation that'd most likely be used if it wasn't exact, that'd be best. otherwise, what you suggested seems fine

[20:23:53.0687] <ptomato>
also, ask Anba, who probably knows exactly how you'd do this most effectively
