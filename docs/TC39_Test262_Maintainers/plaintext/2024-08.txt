How do I check whether someone has signed the Test262 CLA? (Do we check?)

[14:45:51.0523] <cjtenny>
Break into their house and sift through their filing cabinets

[14:46:00.0583] <cjtenny>
then, ask them?

[14:46:03.0518] <cjtenny>
(idk)

[15:43:33.0602] <Michael Ficarra>
any test262 maintainers have a preference on testing strategy for https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3345?

[15:44:26.0284] <Michael Ficarra>
if not, I think I'm just going to embed a huge set of input-output pairs in a test and assert each of them

[15:45:21.0509] <Michael Ficarra>
probably a couple thousand random non-negative finite floats

if you can pick a few cases that you would know to be different if the sqrt was computed using, say, the approximation that'd most likely be used if it wasn't exact, that'd be best. otherwise, what you suggested seems fine

[20:23:53.0687] <ptomato>
also, ask Anba, who probably knows exactly how you'd do this most effectively

the Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic references [Unifying Tests for Square Root](https://archive.org/details/manualzz-id-863632) by Michael Parks and [Berkeley TestFloat](http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/TestFloat.html) and [UCBTEST](https://www.netlib.org/fp/#:~:text=ucbtest.tgz) for concrete (C) implementations

[10:51:42.0732] <Michael Ficarra>
the algorithm for generating interesting cases is a bit hard to follow, but ucbtest does have some fixed input cases I could try to steal as additional test262 tests

JaseW: ljharb: re. test262-harness and eshost, did Brian ever get around to transferring them to TC39?

[09:05:59.0458] <JaseW>
It doesn't look like it, I can ping him

[09:09:34.0195] <Michael Ficarra>
I think people might be using this eshost fork in Brian's absence: https://github.com/CanadaHonk/eshost

[09:09:38.0400] <Michael Ficarra>
@linusgroh:matrix.org may know more

[09:10:36.0090] <JaseW>
There definitely are people using that version, which is why it would be nice to unify this a bit, as there's some fragmentation at the moment

[09:11:16.0962] <linusg>
I don't know of anything other than test262.fyi using our various forks fwiw

[09:14:29.0547] <linusg>
"various" being:
* https://github.com/CanadaHonk/eshost
* https://github.com/CanadaHonk/test262-stream
* https://github.com/CanadaHonk/test262-harness
* https://github.com/CanadaHonk/esvu
* https://github.com/CanadaHonk/jsvu

[09:14:57.0833] <linusg>
some of these are completely dead upstream, others just a bit too unresponsive for quick iteration

[09:17:06.0755] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah I've had PRs open to some of them for years lol

[09:17:52.0397] <linusg>
Definitely fine to have changes cherry-picked back into upstream if someone is volunteering to do that ðŸ˜‰ (cc canadahonk for all of the above)

[09:19:10.0979] <canadahonk>
happy to transfer forks *somewhere* if it would help fwiw

[09:20:30.0132] <JaseW>
So the first question is, are we happy to have these under the TC39 namespace?

- https://github.com/CanadaHonk/eshost
- https://github.com/CanadaHonk/test262-stream
- https://github.com/CanadaHonk/test262-harness
- https://github.com/CanadaHonk/esvu
- https://github.com/CanadaHonk/jsvu

If so, can we cherry pick or just plain move them there and still have people helping maintain them? (esvu/jsvu can be merged I guess?)

[09:27:25.0470] <Chris de Almeida>
ideally we would take control of the upstream repos, right?

[09:42:24.0527] <JaseW>
For the majority of repos, yes, I assume we can take Brian's repos and replay CanadaHonk's changes on to them?
I don't know if I should ask https://github.com/bocoup/test262-stream about bringing this into TC39 namespace (as they don't maintain it anymore)? Im sure they would be fine with that.

esvu is devsnek, maybe he would be happy moving that to TC39, and jsvu isn't needed (as esvu is just a fork of that but more up to date)

[09:45:54.0323] <JaseW>
Then there's the question of npm, I assume we would move some of these tools into here?:
https://www.npmjs.com/org/tc39

[09:56:25.0607] <ptomato>
we talked about taking over eshost and test262-stream in the maintainers meeting today and in principle we're happy to do that but don't want to commit until we have a discussion with more of the maintainers present

[10:00:20.0284] <JaseW>
Which maintainers are you referring to? test262 maintainers? Or the ones of these tools?

fwiw I trust my forks of the directly test262 related repos but stuff like jsvu and esvu is still maintained upstream iirc, those forks are mostly for test262.fyi only changes

[11:24:11.0258] <ptomato>
> <@jasew:matrix.org> Which maintainers are you referring to? test262 maintainers? Or the ones of these tools?

test262 maintainers

jsvu is barely maintained, which is why esvu exists now :)
I talked this through with Jason earlier, we agreed that it would be nice to get:
* anything we currently need jsvu for into esvu so we don't have to deal with both
* the new engines we added to the esvu fork into upstream (currently devsnek)

if maintenance burden of those two things I'm happy to sign up for that (assuming it's not tied to being a test262 maintainer)

ptomato Brian has transferred eshost and test262-harness into tc39 transfer
