yes, we did talk about that in the last meeting - Mike is going to split it up between us

jugglinmike: ^ I might have some time to work on my part later this week or early next week, if you have a suggestion for where I should start

Hey ptomato , I misremembered the action items from the previous meeting, so I don't know if I'll be able to suggest work assignments before tomorrow's meeting

[13:14:16.0299] <ptomato>
maybe we should just get started as time allows, and mark off in a checklist what we've already looked at? then you can split up whatever is remaining once you have the bandwidth for it

[13:39:58.0246] <jugglinmike>
ptomato: That seems fair

hey folks -- who will be handing the 262 report at plenary and how much time do you need?

[13:37:50.0119] <ptomato>
I'm doing it this time around, and I don't think more than 5 minutes will be necessary

[13:52:09.0370] <Chris de Almeida>
great, thanks
