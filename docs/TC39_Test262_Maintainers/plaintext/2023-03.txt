[08:05:18.0569] <Ms2ger>
No, got a conflic, sorry

[08:05:24.0859] <ljharb>
I can in like 20 minutes

[08:05:35.0289] <ljharb>
this timeslot usually doesnâ€™t work for me tho

[08:06:09.0824] <ptomato>
oh, dang. should we redo the poll? this was the only one that worked for everyone at the time

[08:06:55.0042] <ljharb>
my Wednesday morning schedule changed since that time unfortunately

[08:43:03.0365] <ljharb>
```
test262 updates:
 - updated a bunch of tests (champions, please keep up to date about your proposals' test status)
 - RFC process and maintenance practice rationales documented
 - Async Helpers implementation merged
 - google funding gone?
```

test262 updates:
 - updated a bunch of tests (champions, please keep up to date about your proposals' test status)
 - RFC process and maintenance practice rationales documented
 - Async Helpers implementation merged
 - for normative changes to proposals with tests, the notes should indicate who is responsible for filing a test262 issue to track changes
 - google funding gone?
```

[10:16:28.0108] <shu>
ljharb: can confirm on last bullet, will end at end of Q1

[10:16:35.0906] <shu>
i will make an announcement at the next plenary

[10:16:52.0411] <ljharb>
right, the question mark was more, "not sure what to say". ideally your announcement comes before our test262 update, if possible

[10:17:00.0929] <shu>
yeah, or just part of it

[10:17:12.0512] <shu>
i wish it weren't so but, what do they say? "different economic reality"

Hello 262!
Boa was interested in running tests against just a specific version. Such as ES5 or ES2015 etc. Is there an idiomatic way of doing this? like checking out a branch or parsing for tags like this: 
https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/test/language/directive-prologue/func-decl-final-runtime.js#L5-L6

Thanks

There is a Rust harness here: https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/tree/main/boa_tester

Thanks

[16:41:48.0346] <ptomato>
maybe one of the old-timers knows more, but I don't think there's a particular branch or tag that corresponds to a particular ES edition - you might be able to find a point in time where all features in that edition were covered, but there would still be other tests present for things that were only stage 3 at the time

[16:42:23.0743] <ptomato>
off the top of my head, your best avenue might be to keep a list of feature flags to include and exclude for a particular edition

[16:42:58.0498] <jasew>
ok thanks

[16:43:25.0250] <jasew>
What are those frontmatter tags used for? https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/test/language/directive-prologue/func-decl-final-runtime.js#L5-L6

[16:53:51.0426] <ptomato>
es5id is deprecated, it's a section number in the ES5 document (which doesn't tell you much useful information these days)

[16:54:29.0294] <ptomato>
the esid is the name of the HTML anchor corresponding to the section in the living spec document

hi fellow maintainers, I made some slides for the funding announcement and I thought I'd drop them here in case you have any feedback, before I attach them to the agenda: http://ptomato.name/talks/tc39-2023-03/

[16:52:20.0226] <ptomato>
I'll add the item to the agenda but attach the slides Monday to give everyone a chance to look at them

jasew: I don't have any solutions for you, but I can provide some more context: https://github.com/tc39/test262/issues/569 (I guess I'm one of the "old-timers")

[13:28:02.0037] <Richard Gibson>
