ljharb: can confirm on last bullet, will end at end of Q1

[10:16:35.0906] <shu>
i will make an announcement at the next plenary

[10:16:52.0411] <ljharb>
right, the question mark was more, "not sure what to say". ideally your announcement comes before our test262 update, if possible

[10:17:00.0929] <shu>
yeah, or just part of it

[10:17:12.0512] <shu>
i wish it weren't so but, what do they say? "different economic reality"

Hello 262!
Boa was interested in running tests against just a specific version. Such as ES5 or ES2015 etc. Is there an idiomatic way of doing this? like checking out a branch or parsing for tags like this: 
https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/main/test/language/directive-prologue/func-decl-final-runtime.js#L5-L6

Thanks
