I know that different computer systems and devices do things differently, but when I look at the same page on two different browsers on the same computer I should see the same rendering. I remember the old days when every browser "had to be different" but this is 2022. You would think by now that Sir Tim Berners-Lee's original vision would be implemented more concisely than it is. It's OK that the browsers look different in terms of their UI, and that their code is not identical, but it is unacceptable that the way a web page is rendered has to be so different. As an example, I will use one of my web pages. I use Firefox as my primary browser, but Edge came with the OS so I use it for only two purposes: to see what a page I am developing looks like and any searches regarding Windows or Microsoft products such as Office. Otherwise I use Firefox. I invite anyone who chooses to to look at my page in any browser you have and let me know how it compares to Firefox. <a href="https://wayneca.neocities.org/WebDesign/TagList.html">https://wayneca.neocities.org/WebDesign/TagList.html</a>

WHATWG is a consortium of browser developers at heart, so it would make sense that now they can focus on rendering. Web pages are the product of many web page developers, but they all have one thing in common. They want their pages to look the same no matter what browser you are using. Let me describe the difference between Edge and Firefox as far as my page is concerned. Firefox displays it the way I intended for it to look. Edge enlarges the font so it uses more space, resulting in the bottom of the page going below the bottom of the viewport and causing a vertical scrollbar to appear in the viewport pushing the content to the left and changing the way the page looks. This is on the exact same computer. It should not be doing that. Tahoma 12 point should be Tahoma 12 point in every browser. Smaller screen or lower resolution? OK that's a thing, but when it's the same screen and the same resolution the rendering should be identical.</td></tr>
