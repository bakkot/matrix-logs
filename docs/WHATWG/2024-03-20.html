</blockquote>
<p>That’s just the thing: In my case, Keio University is the organization that I was forced by the Participation requirements into stating as being my employer.

<p><a href="https://github.com/w3ckeio/">https://github.com/w3ckeio/</a> is the relevant org in GitHub, and Keio didn’t create it — I myself did, personally. And I did it just to get around the Participation requirements.</p>
<p>The thing is, as far as Keio is concerned, I am essentially just a independent contractor. My arrangement with them is just that each year, I sign a contract with them in which I confirm that the (virtual) lab I’m associated with in their bookkeeping arrangements will transfer to them enough revenue to cover my compensation and their overhead for having me on their books —&nbsp;and they for their part confirm that, out of the revenue I confirm will be brought in, they’ll pay out a certain amount of money to me.</p>
<p>And that’s really it. In particular, I don’t sign away any rights of any kind to them — specifically, I don’t sign away any IPR to them. So they don’t claim any IPR on anything I do, and would never want to, and wouldn’t care to be troubled to even be asked about it.</p>

<p>…In checking with current Chrome (v123 and Canary/), I notice that Chrome now doesn’t seem to close the auto-expanded details elements after I exit the find-in-page UI or after I do a different find-in-page for a different term.</p>
<p>Is that correct? Or am I maybe somehow testing wrong?</p>
<p>I could have sworn that in Chrome previously — back in October or so least — Chrome <em>did</em> close the auto-expanded details elements in the way that spec says we should.</p>
<p>I guess it changed in the meantime? If so, why? For accessibility reasons?</p>
<p>Regardless, if y’all made a decision to un-implement that requirement, should we also remove it from the spec?</p>

</blockquote></mx-reply>For folks on <a href="https://www.w3.org/staff/">https://www.w3.org/staff/</a>, I'd expect a public association with <a href="https://github.com/w3c">https://github.com/w3c</a> to be sufficient, especially now that W3C Inc. exists. But that's also not generalizable to other people employed by universities.
