It's not entirely clear to me they are unambiguous. In particular for <code>selectedcontent</code> it's a bit weird. It can appear in phrasing content, but only when there's an ancestor button element which has a parent select element, I think?

But maybe not til early next week. (I have to be at what's basically a local member-recruiting event all day today and tomorrow.) But as far as precedents, I think it's possible we do actually have some â€” maybe not in HTML itself, but instead in the ARIA specs, which has some particular document/authoring-conformance requirements that are significantly more baroque than anything in HTML (including ones that require looking up the ancestor tree).</td></tr>

&gt; During TPAC 2024 we scheduled 14 breakouts in parallel in each of 6 slots. Our goal for TPAC 2025 is to schedule only 10 breakouts in parallel. Because we expect receiving 80-90 session proposals, we are organizing 9 1-hour slots during the week as follows (all times Japan):  

- Monday: 17:00-18:00 
- Tuesday: 08:30-09:30
