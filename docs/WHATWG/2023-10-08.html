const assert = require('node:assert/strict');

(async () =&gt; {
  let controller;
  const ts = new TransformStream({
    start(c) {
      controller = c;
    }
  });
  const cancelReason = { name: 'cancelReason' };
  const cancelPromise = ts.readable.cancel(cancelReason);
  controller.terminate();
  return Promise.all([
    cancelPromise,
    assert.rejects(ts.writable.getWriter().closed)
  ]);

I had one question in regards to the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/streams/commit/007d729f1476f7f1ea34731ba9bd2becb702117e">https://github.com/whatwg/streams/commit/007d729f1476f7f1ea34731ba9bd2becb702117e</a>, i have been trying to implement this in nodejs and i am bumping into what seems like a race condition between promises its better explained with code consider the code here <a href="https://gist.github.com/debadree25/c54931a99e493baaf9314a903cd52e12">https://gist.github.com/debadree25/c54931a99e493baaf9314a903cd52e12</a> now when we create a transform stream we have one promise created on the writable side the "startPromise" as noted in <a href="https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#set-up-writable-stream-default-controller">https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#set-up-writable-stream-default-controller</a> and when we called the cancel method on the readable we get a cancellation promise as noted in <a href="https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#transform-stream-default-source-cancel">https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#transform-stream-default-source-cancel</a> now in the code after this we call on controller.terminate which causes the writable side to go into the "erroring" stage, now comes the interesting part the "startPromise" gets resolved and causes the writable part to go into "errored" mode after which the close promise resolves rejecting the cancellation promise we received I think this is expected behaviour? since promises are executed in a queue manner? strangely this issue doesnt seem to affect the reference implementation here <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/streams">https://github.com/whatwg/streams</a> and the promises get executed in the order: -created start promise
-cancel promise created
-cancel promise resolving
-start promise resolving. I dont think this could be a problem with the spec maybe there is something i am missing? if anyone has any insight it would be great!! Thank you for reading! :-)</td></tr>
