Yeah, when Hixie wrote algorithms we didn't have an established way of writing them yet and not everything he wrote has been refactored. The `img` element could really do with a refactoring of its processing model as well as abstracting some aspects of the fetch pipeline so they can be shared with other image endpoints.

Hi

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Support_desk#Why_%3Cbr%3E_instead_of_just_a_new_line?

I created a simple test.html thanks to the 1st example of https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp & I discovered the issue of this link is general to HTML, so same question of the link.

TabAtkins: Regarding https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12054#issuecomment-3837656822 I’m trying to figure out what needs to be done — what people want to be done.

Question: It seems like all the auto-publishing plumbing that Andreu had originally set up has maybe subsequently been superseded by tooling you set in since then?

[18:12:59.0596] <sideshowbarker>
And to make auto-publishing work for the FXTF and Houdini stuff, I could replicate the workflow y’all currently have set up for the w3c/csswg-drafts repo?
