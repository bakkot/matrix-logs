Yeah, when Hixie wrote algorithms we didn't have an established way of writing them yet and not everything he wrote has been refactored. The `img` element could really do with a refactoring of its processing model as well as abstracting some aspects of the fetch pipeline so they can be shared with other image endpoints.

Hi

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Support_desk#Why_%3Cbr%3E_instead_of_just_a_new_line?

I created a simple test.html thanks to the 1st example of https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp & I discovered the issue of this link is general to HTML, so same question of the link.

Hi all, just a friendly reminder to post any discussion topics for this Thursday's joint CSSWG/WHATWG/OpenUI task force meeting to the meeting agenda issue: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/12104

TabAtkins: Regarding https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12054#issuecomment-3837656822 I’m trying to figure out what needs to be done — what people want to be done.

[18:11:54.0621] <sideshowbarker>
Question: It seems like all the auto-publishing plumbing that Andreu had originally set up has maybe subsequently been superseded by tooling you set in since then?

[18:12:59.0596] <sideshowbarker>
And to make auto-publishing work for the FXTF and Houdini stuff, I could replicate the workflow y’all currently have set up for the w3c/csswg-drafts repo?

[18:13:18.0476] <sideshowbarker>
/me waves to Andreu Botella too

[18:14:18.0055] <sideshowbarker>
Andreu Botella: I don’t wanna bug you with stuff if you’re swamped and I can manage to get it working without you needing take any time away from what you’re working on n

[18:14:20.0984] <sideshowbarker>
* Andreu Botella: I don’t wanna bug you with stuff if you’re swamped and I can manage to get it working without you needing take any time away from what you’re working on

[18:15:33.0091] <sideshowbarker>
I’m gonna need to step away now from my machine for the next 90 minutes to 2 hours anyway — but I’ll get back to this after that

[18:16:41.0934] <sideshowbarker>
However, if anybody else has more clear idea of what exactly the problems are that need to be solved, and you want to take a shot at doing the set up to fix them, I wouldn’t mind at all if somebody beat me to it… 

[18:20:46.0135] <Andreu Botella>
well, currently the index of specs is still handled by plins's server, and eventually we'd want to get that also generated by the gh actions workflow

[18:21:25.0255] <sideshowbarker>
OK, can definitely do that — probably by end-of-day my time

[18:22:41.0544] <Andreu Botella>
at first bin/build-index.py would build an index, as well as create level-less shortcuts (e.g. css-fonts for whichever the current level is)

[18:23:02.0796] <Andreu Botella>
and for that it'd use various heuristics to figure out which is the current work, with a list of exceptions

[18:23:44.0873] <Andreu Botella>
in my repo there's still a version of that that does generate an index, although it looks quite different from the one in plins's server

[18:25:05.0603] <sideshowbarker>
OK, I’ll take a look

[18:25:30.0127] <sideshowbarker>
the *“various heuristics”* is clearly the hard part…

[18:26:54.0435] <sideshowbarker>
for the csswg-drafts repor, there are corresponding _“various heuristics”_ captured in existing build stuff there?

[18:27:46.0259] <sideshowbarker>
I mean, I just want something I could use as a model for the *“various heuristics”* for the other repos

[18:30:15.0815] <Andreu Botella>
okay, so first I'm trying to get the shortname from bikeshed metadata, and i'm hardcoding some cases where it's wrong (where the shortname includes the level): https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/bin/build-index.py#L68-L84

[18:30:46.0359] <Andreu Botella>
there's something similar for html-only specs in `get_html_spec_metadata`

[18:33:21.0847] <Andreu Botella>
and in https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/bin/build-index.py#L171-L193 I'm grouping specs by their shortname, and for each shortname, i'm picking the earliest level that isn't marked as complete – or otherwise the highest level

[18:33:44.0056] <Andreu Botella>
and there's the list of exceptions for cases where that's wrong

[18:35:03.0492] <Andreu Botella>
in the august F2F folks mentioned that (at least for csswg-drafts) you can find out which level is the current work based on the github issue labels

[18:35:11.0815] <Andreu Botella>
but it'd be better to maintain that as a json in the repo or something

[20:44:17.0304] <sideshowbarker>
Andreu Botella: got it all, thanks — that’s enough for me to work with

[21:26:31.0826] <sideshowbarker>
Incidentally, I’ve noticed that the toolchain seems to still be set up to add some client-side script to the output HTML to make the w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts URLs redirect to drafts.csswg.org URLs

[21:27:17.0353] <sideshowbarker>
…but it apparently is no longer working, and I’ve tried to figure out why, but I haven’t been able to figure it out

[21:28:15.0371] <sideshowbarker>
But I’m not complaining. We shouldn’t be doing those redirects, so I’m glad it’s turned off … somewhere … or else, broken.

[21:28:38.0514] <sideshowbarker>
If something broke it accidentally, then thank god for that happy accident.

[21:57:22.0131] <sideshowbarker>
TabAtkins: Question: does `--md-Text-Macro="BUILTBYGITHUBCI foo"` have any purpose other than making that redirect happen? (when it was actually working/enabled)

[22:18:06.0880] <sideshowbarker>
ok wait, only now do I notice that y’all got all the FXTF drafts moved to the csswg-drafts repo? And you’re redirecting all the old URLs?  And if so, then it gets me back to my original question of, trying to figure out what actual problem people commenting in https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12054#issuecomment-3837656822 want solved

[22:47:26.0550] <TabAtkins>
What I want solved is to take Peter's server out of the loop entirely

[22:47:38.0344] <TabAtkins>
Just use GitHub to just and use our domain name

[22:49:54.0371] <sideshowbarker>
Yeah me too

[22:49:59.0753] <sideshowbarker>
so, let’s do that

[22:50:24.0567] <TabAtkins>
* Just use GitHub to host and use our domain name

[22:50:48.0262] <sideshowbarker>
I will huddle with the systems team and get a concrete plan put together for that

[22:51:02.0597] <sideshowbarker>
Chris Lilley wants that too

[22:51:40.0743] <sideshowbarker>
(I mean, as far as I can tell from his GH issue comment — I haven’t talked to him about out directly)

[22:52:21.0718] <sideshowbarker>
but I will not be volunteering to replicate anything from the drafts.csswg.org server except for the actual document publishing

[22:53:19.0603] <sideshowbarker>
whatever else myriad features it might have, I’m not gonna try to be the one to set up some server at w3c to do any of that other stuff

[22:55:15.0820] <sideshowbarker>
What I want is simply that: When some implementor from a browser project is in the middle of implementing some CSS feature, they can reliably access the CSS specs, and not instead have their work blocked by the server being down/broken/wedged

[22:56:42.0547] <sideshowbarker>
personally I would prefer to quit using that domain main, except for to hosting 301 redirects to the GH locations. But I don’t feel strongly about it — if we could just do the CNAME thing, then, fine.

[22:56:50.0433] <sideshowbarker>
* personally I would prefer to quit using that domain name, except for to hosting 301 redirects to the GH locations. But I don’t feel strongly about it — if we could just do the CNAME thing, then, fine.

[22:58:31.0893] <sideshowbarker>
TabAtkins: (or anybody else who might now) Do you have any idea what is being used by that server to do the markdown-to-html conversion? If so, I will try to set up something in the GH repo to do that. But if not, then I guess for now I’ll try to … black-box reverse-engineer it.

[22:59:14.0396] <sideshowbarker>
will just use the python `markdown` thing, I guess?

[23:19:46.0291] <TabAtkins>
> <@sideshowbarker:matrix.org> personally I would prefer to quit using that domain name, except for to hosting 301 redirects to the GH locations. But I don’t feel strongly about it — if we could just do the CNAME thing, then, fine.

Depending on the GitHub url space is not great; I'd prefer it if the w3c offered non-rename redirects to all the WGs so they had urls under w3.org. We don't want to break a lot of links if GitHub ever goes away.

[23:20:23.0998] <TabAtkins>
> <@sideshowbarker:matrix.org> TabAtkins: (or anybody else who might now) Do you have any idea what is being used by that server to do the markdown-to-html conversion? If so, I will try to set up something in the GH repo to do that. But if not, then I guess for now I’ll try to … black-box reverse-engineer it.

Not a clue. But maybe we can just redirect anything with an md to the GitHub rendering 

[23:23:50.0700] <sideshowbarker>
I wouldn’t object to others setting up that stuff. But in the meantime at least, I’m personally pretty happy with GH publishing. It’s what pretty much all other projects I contribute to outside of W3C are using, so … to me it’s reliable and familiar, at least.

And now I say that, I do realize that for WHATWG stuff, we do have a different non-GH thing set up. So yeah, point taken.

[23:34:27.0656] <sideshowbarker>
OK, for the markdown-to-HTML conversion, here’s something quick and clean and simple: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/pull/13432/files

next bit: https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts/pull/1165/files

[00:31:59.0331] <sideshowbarker>
OK, and now https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/pull/13433/files will give us a proper index page at w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts — rather than a redirect to the legacy server

[00:32:12.0051] <sideshowbarker>
(and with that, I take a break to cook dinner)

[00:53:45.0142] <sideshowbarker>
Andreu Botella: (or anybody else who might know) What exactly is the “issues list” that needs to be built?

Is that maybe https://drafts.csswg.org/issues.html? Or something else entirely?

[00:55:23.0547] <sideshowbarker>
I guess for now I’m gonna just assume that’s what it is, and try to figure out how to remake that
