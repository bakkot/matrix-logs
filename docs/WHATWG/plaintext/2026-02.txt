Yeah, when Hixie wrote algorithms we didn't have an established way of writing them yet and not everything he wrote has been refactored. The `img` element could really do with a refactoring of its processing model as well as abstracting some aspects of the fetch pipeline so they can be shared with other image endpoints.

Hi

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Support_desk#Why_%3Cbr%3E_instead_of_just_a_new_line?

I created a simple test.html thanks to the 1st example of https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp & I discovered the issue of this link is general to HTML, so same question of the link.

Hi all, just a friendly reminder to post any discussion topics for this Thursday's joint CSSWG/WHATWG/OpenUI task force meeting to the meeting agenda issue: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/12104

TabAtkins: Regarding https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12054#issuecomment-3837656822 I’m trying to figure out what needs to be done — what people want to be done.

[18:11:54.0621] <sideshowbarker>
Question: It seems like all the auto-publishing plumbing that Andreu had originally set up has maybe subsequently been superseded by tooling you set in since then?

[18:12:59.0596] <sideshowbarker>
And to make auto-publishing work for the FXTF and Houdini stuff, I could replicate the workflow y’all currently have set up for the w3c/csswg-drafts repo?

[18:13:18.0476] <sideshowbarker>
/me waves to Andreu Botella too

[18:14:18.0055] <sideshowbarker>
Andreu Botella: I don’t wanna bug you with stuff if you’re swamped and I can manage to get it working without you needing take any time away from what you’re working on n

[18:15:33.0091] <sideshowbarker>
I’m gonna need to step away now from my machine for the next 90 minutes to 2 hours anyway — but I’ll get back to this after that

[18:16:41.0934] <sideshowbarker>
However, if anybody else has more clear idea of what exactly the problems are that need to be solved, and you want to take a shot at doing the set up to fix them, I wouldn’t mind at all if somebody beat me to it… 

[18:20:46.0135] <Andreu Botella>
well, currently the index of specs is still handled by plins's server, and eventually we'd want to get that also generated by the gh actions workflow

[18:21:25.0255] <sideshowbarker>
OK, can definitely do that — probably by end-of-day my time

[18:22:41.0544] <Andreu Botella>
at first bin/build-index.py would build an index, as well as create level-less shortcuts (e.g. css-fonts for whichever the current level is)

[18:23:02.0796] <Andreu Botella>
and for that it'd use various heuristics to figure out which is the current work, with a list of exceptions

[18:23:44.0873] <Andreu Botella>
in my repo there's still a version of that that does generate an index, although it looks quite different from the one in plins's server

[18:25:05.0603] <sideshowbarker>
OK, I’ll take a look

[18:25:30.0127] <sideshowbarker>
the *“various heuristics”* is clearly the hard part…

[18:26:54.0435] <sideshowbarker>
for the csswg-drafts repor, there are corresponding _“various heuristics”_ captured in existing build stuff there?

[18:27:46.0259] <sideshowbarker>
I mean, I just want something I could use as a model for the *“various heuristics”* for the other repos

[18:30:15.0815] <Andreu Botella>
okay, so first I'm trying to get the shortname from bikeshed metadata, and i'm hardcoding some cases where it's wrong (where the shortname includes the level): https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/bin/build-index.py#L68-L84

[18:30:46.0359] <Andreu Botella>
there's something similar for html-only specs in `get_html_spec_metadata`

[18:33:21.0847] <Andreu Botella>
and in https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/bin/build-index.py#L171-L193 I'm grouping specs by their shortname, and for each shortname, i'm picking the earliest level that isn't marked as complete – or otherwise the highest level

[18:33:44.0056] <Andreu Botella>
and there's the list of exceptions for cases where that's wrong

[18:35:03.0492] <Andreu Botella>
in the august F2F folks mentioned that (at least for csswg-drafts) you can find out which level is the current work based on the github issue labels

[18:35:11.0815] <Andreu Botella>
but it'd be better to maintain that as a json in the repo or something

[20:44:17.0304] <sideshowbarker>
Andreu Botella: got it all, thanks — that’s enough for me to work with

[21:26:31.0826] <sideshowbarker>
Incidentally, I’ve noticed that the toolchain seems to still be set up to add some client-side script to the output HTML to make the w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts URLs redirect to drafts.csswg.org URLs

[21:27:17.0353] <sideshowbarker>
…but it apparently is no longer working, and I’ve tried to figure out why, but I haven’t been able to figure it out

[21:28:15.0371] <sideshowbarker>
But I’m not complaining. We shouldn’t be doing those redirects, so I’m glad it’s turned off … somewhere … or else, broken.

[21:28:38.0514] <sideshowbarker>
If something broke it accidentally, then thank god for that happy accident.

[21:57:22.0131] <sideshowbarker>
TabAtkins: Question: does `--md-Text-Macro="BUILTBYGITHUBCI foo"` have any purpose other than making that redirect happen? (when it was actually working/enabled)
