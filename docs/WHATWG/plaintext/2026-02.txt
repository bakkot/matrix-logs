Yeah, when Hixie wrote algorithms we didn't have an established way of writing them yet and not everything he wrote has been refactored. The `img` element could really do with a refactoring of its processing model as well as abstracting some aspects of the fetch pipeline so they can be shared with other image endpoints.

Hi

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Support_desk#Why_%3Cbr%3E_instead_of_just_a_new_line?

I created a simple test.html thanks to the 1st example of https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp & I discovered the issue of this link is general to HTML, so same question of the link.
