Hi guys, is this room appropriate to ask questions regarding the HTML spec?

I'll ask for now, but feel free to delete it if it's not allowed, so here is my question:

In the HTML parsing section, specifically the "Named character reference state", we have the following info:

>>> Consume the maximum number of characters possible, where the consumed characters are one of the identifiers in the first column of the named character references table. Append each character to the temporary buffer when it's consumed.

>>[If there is a match]:

If the character reference was consumed as part of an attribute, and the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), and the next input character is either a U+003D EQUALS SIGN character (=) or an ASCII alphanumeric, then, for historical reasons, flush code points consumed as a character reference and switch to the return state.

>>[Otherwise:]

If the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), then this is a missing-semicolon-after-character-reference parse error.

Set the temporary buffer to the empty string. Append one or two characters corresponding to the character reference name (as given by the second column of the named character references table) to the temporary buffer.

Flush code points consumed as a character reference. Switch to the return state.
