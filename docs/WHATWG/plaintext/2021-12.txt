Hi guys, is this room appropriate to ask questions regarding the HTML spec?

[20:21:42.0914] <devsrealmguy>
I'll ask for now, but feel free to delete it if it's not allowed, so here is my question:

[20:21:53.0439] <devsrealmguy>
* I'll ask for now, but feel free to delete it if it's not allowed, so here is my question:

[20:29:54.0931] <devsrealmguy>
In the HTML parsing section, specifically the "Named character reference state", we have the following info:

>>> Consume the maximum number of characters possible, where the consumed characters are one of the identifiers in the first column of the named character references table. Append each character to the temporary buffer when it's consumed.

>>[If there is a match]:

If the character reference was consumed as part of an attribute, and the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), and the next input character is either a U+003D EQUALS SIGN character (=) or an ASCII alphanumeric, then, for historical reasons, flush code points consumed as a character reference and switch to the return state.

>>[Otherwise:]

If the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), then this is a missing-semicolon-after-character-reference parse error.

Set the temporary buffer to the empty string. Append one or two characters corresponding to the character reference name (as given by the second column of the named character references table) to the temporary buffer.

Flush code points consumed as a character reference. Switch to the return state.

[20:33:50.0109] <devsrealmguy>
At what point do I decide to stop consuming? It's not clear , I know I can lookahead and stop matching when I encounter a semi-colon but the spec doesn't make that clear

[20:35:09.0154] <sideshowbarker>
devsrealmguy: I think you basically stop consuming when there‚Äôs no match

[20:35:20.0976] <sideshowbarker>
no substring match

[20:38:40.0369] <sideshowbarker>
so if you get `&h`, keep consuming, `&he`, keep consuming, `&hel`, `&hell`, `&helli`, still consuming

[20:39:28.0815] <sideshowbarker>
because those all are substring matches of valid character references

[20:40:07.0990] <sideshowbarker>
but if you hit `&helliq`, stop consuming ‚Äî because that is not a substring match of any valid character reference

[20:41:01.0746] <devsrealmguy>
Thanks for replying, I appreciate it a lot. I am on mobile, so, it's really hard to write and my sight is really poor, so, sorry if I my grammar is wrong. 

And yes, that is exactly what I am doing, what if you have &not and &notin?

[20:44:06.0282] <devsrealmguy>
> but if you hit `&helliq`, stop consuming ‚Äî because that is not a substring match of any valid character reference

Brilliant, I was looking to stop consuming when I encounter a semi-colon but you just nailed it.

[20:54:43.0723] <devsrealmguy>
Never mind with the &notit and &notin. Got it, thanks üòä

[23:29:26.0200] <Noam Rosenthal>
morning annevk, I think https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1311 is reviewable again, and I have two other pending ones (preload & controller), when you get the chance to look

[06:48:50.0645] <devsrealmguy>
I think I am done with covering the tokenization state, the only state that is a bit difficult is the "Named Character Reference State".

Just to confirm I didn't mess things up, this point says:

1) If the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), then this is a missing-semicolon-after-character-reference parse error.

2) Set the temporary buffer to the empty string. Append one or two characters corresponding to the character reference name (as given by the second column of the named character references table) to the temporary buffer"

An example of point 1 is this: "James &amp his brother went for launch". 

It is clear that the &amp is missing a semi-colon, so, is the point 2 saying to correct it to &amp; (with the semi-colon) or is it saying to swap it with the codepoint which is U+00026 as that is what is given in the second column table which the point 2 is referring to.

I was curious enough to check how other libraries did theirs, some are converting the codepoint to a character, some are appending the semi-colon and many ignored it. I can see why it trips people of.

Where should I sail to?

[06:57:09.0409] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
Step 1 is just "the author screwed up" - you should ignore the step completely unless you surface parse errors somehow

[06:59:28.0394] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
`&amp` without the semicolon is in the table, so you just parsed an "&"

[07:00:12.0195] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
Did that help or just confuse more? :)

[07:00:28.0904] <devsrealmguy>
You mean, I should add the "&" to the temporary buffer?

[07:02:23.0453] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
Yes, it seems like that's the result

[07:02:41.0652] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>

[07:07:48.0296] <kaleidea>
and a google account ;-)

kaleidea: FWIW, the fundamental problem with inheritance for HTML elements is that engine logic is based on local name, not type of class; this is also why custom elements has the is="" hack (which in retrospect I wish we never shipped)

[07:32:03.0459] <annevk>
The other problem with a new element for navigation is bad XSS filters and just overall complexity.

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> kaleidea: FWIW, the fundamental problem with inheritance for HTML elements is that engine logic is based on local name, not type of class; this is also why custom elements has the is="" hack (which in retrospect I wish we never shipped)

HTMLFormElement is a final class (all HTML*Elements are), so inheritance quickly fell out as a solution. I've made <search> a HTMLFormElement, distinguished only by qualified name (namespace incl.). This is the same solution that's used for <main>, <section>, etc. - and would be used for the div-based <search> -, but with HTMLElement being the instantiated class.

[07:37:09.0603] <kaleidea>
However, being a HTMLFormElement, all the form logic also applies without additional effort.

[07:37:48.0174] <annevk>
Right, I'm saying that's false.

[07:38:20.0112] <kaleidea>
Where does it fail?

[07:39:04.0682] <annevk>
I recommend reading up on the web component discussions around inheritance, maybe that will help clear it up.

[07:39:23.0696] <kaleidea>
Sure, do you have a link handy?

[07:42:24.0881] <kaleidea>
Or a starting point. Is it all in the GH issues?

I'll investigate this clue, might take a day or more. https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+custom+element+inheritance  is not immediately useful. If you find any pointers in the meantime, I'll appreciate it.

annevk: currently the navigate spec often sends a request with referrer policy = "", referrer = "no-referrer". (e.g. for <a rel="noreferrer">) It would be more elegant if we just used referrer policy. Do you think that's possible?

[04:28:23.0066] <annevk>
Domenic: that's probably feasible, though setting referrer directly is quicker in theory as it bypasses the referrer policy check

Noam Rosenthal: if they are indistinguishable in your editor, I recommend copying from https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#lists

[04:21:17.0162] <Noam Rosenthal>
gotcha annevk. I must say I find these ambiguous unicode characters in specs somewhat cumbersome...

[04:24:34.0955] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: regarding `allow preloads` and custom headers, how would you suggest to ignore preloads when custom XHR/fetch() headers are present?

[04:25:11.0207] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I think the presence of any header would indicate a custom header

[04:25:55.0977] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: ok

[04:26:14.0255] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: you can guard the check with "unsafe-request flag" which only fetch() and XHR set

[04:26:59.0578] <annevk>
As for the Unicode characters, they generally seem to work okay for me as long as I copy-and-paste. Could you elaborate on what makes them cumbersome?

[04:27:19.0047] <Noam Rosenthal>
they're cumbersome because mistakes are not visible to the naked eye

[04:27:45.0123] <Noam Rosenthal>
and they're not common characters in other forms of programming, and don't appear on keyboards

[04:28:14.0394] <Noam Rosenthal>
I think that makes them unique among characters used in specs, but I might be wrong about that

[04:29:27.0331] <annevk>
Well, the precedent here is JavaScript, which uses the same characters for its internal List type

[04:29:55.0962] <Noam Rosenthal>
Yea, I figured there's some historical reason for this

[04:32:04.0578] <Noam Rosenthal>
@annevk: regarding "allow preloads", I thought to keep it for now for the "sync XHR" case, I don't think there's another way for fetch to know that this is a case where preload should be avoided

[04:36:55.0012] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: sync xhr always bypasses preloads? I didn't know. Seems somewhat unfortunate to give sync xhr a special ability. Might make people want to use it more.

[04:38:32.0968] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: yea, actually I should dig more into why chrome does that. I don't think other implementations do. Maybe that part should be outside the spec for now and added separately with a separate discussion

[04:42:41.0338] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: to be clear, "done" running before "end-of-body" is also bad

[04:45:12.0916] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: not sure why, but I can follow along

[04:46:14.0405] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: because whoever is passing these callbacks might set up state accordingly, if they get them out of order that could lead to unexpected results

[04:46:59.0563] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: right, and I thought that saying that `done` always come before `end of body` is equivalent to the opposite

[04:47:17.0595] <Noam Rosenthal>
though maybe it's less intuitive, naming-wise

[04:47:45.0013] <annevk>
"done" is the last thing, after "end-of-body" you might get trailers (though they are not exposed atm)

[04:48:46.0799] <annevk>
In any event, we wouldn't want to change the order as part of a PR to expose network errors better, right?

[04:51:09.0068] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: currently there are no callers of both "done" and "end of body". maybe they should be either/or? It would make things clearer. IMO having both callbacks doesn't make sense

[04:51:26.0721] <Noam Rosenthal>
"end of body" sort-of encapsulates "done"

[04:54:07.0169] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: we could merge them potentially

[04:54:27.0334] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: oh wait, end-of-body does its reading thing

[04:55:25.0067] <Noam Rosenthal>
yes exactly, we added done for `fetch()` and for random things which don't need the response body, such as `sendBeacon`

[04:55:32.0368] <annevk>
I think it's okay to use both, especially once we have trailers, but I could see adding that requirement for now

[04:56:21.0551] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: OK, so I can keep the order as is, but add an assert at the beginning of fetch. would that work?

[04:58:25.0734] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I'm not sure I follow, what kind of assertion?

[04:59:01.0157] <Noam Rosenthal>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> Noam Rosenthal: I'm not sure I follow, what kind of assertion?

how would you specify an either/or parameter to fetch?

[04:59:49.0826] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I suggest we leave that to a follow-up PR, I'm not entirely convinced yet it's worth doing

[05:00:33.0573] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: ok, so is it still necessary to change the order right now? it complicates the logic a bit but doable

[05:05:02.0730] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: yeah, because we should set things like the done flag in the right order

[05:24:29.0642] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: updated both PRs, thanks for your time. btw with the ¬ª thingy, maybe it's worthwhile to add a lint rule to disallow the character that looks like it?

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> kaleidea: WICG/webcomponents is prolly a better starting point; you'll also run into it if you try to implement it in a browser

@annevk I've dug through webcomponents. I've found the following worth to investigate:

4 discussions listed at: https://gist.github.com/Kaleidea/49055f021e7da814c233846a95115f96

Are these the ones you've hinted at?

[00:30:30.0658] <annevk>
kaleidea: it might be too late for removal, though Safari notably does not ship it; I think that would be better.

I don't think there's research, those were known facts by the participants who work on such code.

[00:33:08.0047] <kaleidea>
Just to be clear: removal without an alternative?

[00:38:37.0681] <annevk>
kaleidea: yeah, we could probably support inheritance with a lot of work by moving things to use instance checks, change Selectors around, etc. but it's not clear to me that inheritance is really that great of a programming pattern to go through all that effort for

[00:39:35.0017] <annevk>
I think the strides we're making with composition-like semantics (see form-associated custom elements for instance) show a lot more promise

[00:47:16.0263] <kaleidea>
> moving things to use instance checks

I'd imagine that would more likely look like `element.builtinTagName === 'button'`. Selectors are a longer story though, for ex. `@button`, but choosing the spec. char would be difficult. Maybe that wouldn't be necessary if style inheritance would be as easy as `my-button { @apply button; }`
> composition-like semantics (see form-associated custom elements

That's one specific case. It seems to me there's a lot of work to do to make that into a general composition pattern.

Just a few thoughts. I'm going to return to the original topic.

[00:57:32.0126] <kaleidea>
annevk: Back to your point:
> FWIW, the fundamental problem with inheritance for HTML elements is that engine logic is based on local name

Yes and no. The entry point of the basic logic is virtual functions such as ParseAttribute() and HandleLocalEvents(), which is based on the vftable, independent of local name. Parsing and cross-cutting logic is dependent on tagName, but some of that uses `IsA<>` type-checking (which is trivial to implement with a more reliable form of type identification).

Btw, did you mean to refer to RTTI being disabled in Blink and substituted with tagName checking?



[01:11:48.0979] <annevk>
No

[01:28:13.0939] <kaleidea>
Implementing the search element requires only 10 tagName comparisons (3 of which are type checks), 5 more than without form.
3 comparisons are in the parser, pre-instantiation, that must be tagName check. 2 is to differentiate with form, must be tagName. The remaining 5 can be type checks (dynamic_cast).
That's the extent of the impact the search element has on the browser. How does that affect your views?


[01:32:20.0900] <annevk>
I think you're underestimating the effort required.

[01:32:57.0885] <kaleidea>
Did you know that I've already implemented it?


[01:35:38.0389] <annevk>
I got that impression, but I strongly suspect there will be things that are broken. Anyway, it's also not clear to me this is the best design. Overloading functionality and having multiple elements to do the same thing has created problems in the past.

[01:38:37.0562] <kaleidea>
annevk: I've shared it probably 5-10 times. If you find any test vectors that are broken that would help my work.

> <@karlcow:mozilla.org> good work here from krosylight about events across browsers https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1653882#c14

This seems like really good research, and the sort of thing we've been solving in the HTML Standard triage meetings. A spec issue with research + proposal for best behavior that is sensible but also likely web-compatible + list of deltas between current behavior and that proposal would be a great next step IMO.

[01:44:46.0137] <kaleidea>
> not clear to me this is the best design

Well, there's no competitor aiming to be a better design. This OTOH matches developer expectations.


[13:38:34.0928] <kaleidea>
 * annevk: I've shared it probably 5-10 times. Assumptions aren't useful. If you find any test vectors that are broken that would help my work. Good solutions are built on facts and testing.

anyone have a favorite HTML5 formatter (beautifier)? Prettier's output looks a bit unnatural to me and have only really been exposed [`htacg/tidy-html5`](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5) and some other ones that come bundled as text editor extensions

**Quick question:** If the [ownerDocument](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-node-ownerdocument) is to return null if it is a document or document if it is another node type, why does the number 4 of [insert a character](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#insert-a-character)  says the following:
> Otherwise, create a new `Text node` whose data is data and **whose node document is the same as that of the element in which the adjusted insertion location finds itself**, and insert the newly created node at the adjusted insertion location.

I am referring to the bolded part above, why do I need to use the document of the adjusted location in the `Text node` yet again if each node has an associated node document set upon creation, wouldn't that be superfluous since they likely point to the same document anyway?

devsrealmguy: that step is allocating a new Text node, so for that it needs to specify the node document

[02:28:21.0570] <devsrealmguy>
Thanks, that's what I was doing, I was confused when that passage says it should be the adjusted location document, after back and forth, I realized it was for emphasis. Thanks, appreciate your reply.

Noam Rosenthal: I think you're correct that the callback order will have to end up switching

[03:50:14.0770] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: doing anything else seems rather involved

[03:50:30.0980] <annevk>
It does seem like the current patch still has logic bugs

[03:50:46.0651] <Noam Rosenthal>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> Noam Rosenthal: doing anything else seems rather involved

Yea, I think it would be much more succinct if the callbacks are either/or

[03:51:03.0966] <Noam Rosenthal>
if there is a future use case that needs both endOfBody and done we can deal with it then

[03:51:23.0038] <annevk>
I don't think they have to be exclusive per se, but the consume operation will necessarily complete after EOF has been reached

[03:51:37.0872] <Noam Rosenthal>
yea

[03:51:57.0490] <Noam Rosenthal>
and request's "done" would mean "EOF" rather than something to do with whether it has been consumed

[03:52:20.0951] <Noam Rosenthal>
(that flag is anyway a bit strange, is it in use?)

[03:53:45.0918] <annevk>
It's for fetch groups, but those haven't been completely defined

[03:59:38.0386] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: ok, I re-switched the order. Did it have other logic errors?

[04:01:08.0862] <annevk>
I wasn't really ready evaluating this thing yet

[04:04:15.0985] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I think this works, but we need better names, maybe in a follow-up PR

[04:04:35.0199] <Noam Rosenthal>
better names for "process response done" and "process response end of body"?

[04:04:42.0273] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: what's now "done" really seems more like EOF and what's now EOF really seems more like "consume body"

[04:05:00.0820] <Noam Rosenthal>
got it

[04:05:05.0934] <annevk>
I'm not sure how disruptive that will be though at this point, thoughts?

[04:05:18.0731] <Noam Rosenthal>
process response done is used by 2-3 places I know well

[04:05:22.0821] <Noam Rosenthal>
(I added all of them)

[04:05:26.0595] <annevk>
If I do the rename for Fetch and XHR, can you tackle the other places?

[04:05:34.0221] <Noam Rosenthal>
absolutely

[04:05:57.0897] <Noam Rosenthal>
I think I added processResponseEndOfBody to CSS, and HTML mainly uses processResponse

[04:06:46.0272] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: what's the status of https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/30968? Presumably some of those tests have to be updated now it's HTTP(S)-only?

[04:06:50.0499] <Noam Rosenthal>
Maybe processResponseEndOfStream. Also it's not exactly "process", it's more of a notification

[04:07:08.0968] <Noam Rosenthal>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> Noam Rosenthal: what's the status of https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/30968? Presumably some of those tests have to be updated now it's HTTP(S)-only?

Already done. I removed the tests for blob: about: etc

[04:07:35.0140] <Noam Rosenthal>
also the tests for abort are gone

[04:07:57.0648] <Noam Rosenthal>
it's only tests that can't be distinguished from CORS errors - like timeout, too many redirects, host not found etc.

[04:08:46.0225] <Noam Rosenthal>
How about "processResponseFlush"? To correspond with stream naming

[04:11:03.0964] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: yeah that also seems reasonable

[04:12:04.0145] <Noam Rosenthal>
request's "done" flag can be renamed to "flushed"

[04:13:11.0278] <annevk>
Yeah maybe. I'll merge the PR and then write the renaming patch. I think I'll just do the algorithms for now.

Well, I don't really understand it well enough to comment :). I guess it seems like the main content is the nested 6th bullet, and that will modify https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-directionality ? That seems like a lot less spec than what Fantasai proposes in her comment, but maybe it's just a really short statement of it.

[14:20:43.0807] <Domenic>
My plan is to do editorial review only, and delegate normative spec review to people like Fantasai or the Chrome rendering team who understand this stuff better.

[14:22:34.0113] <Domenic>
I guess also the 5th bullet indicates that there'll be a big change of most of #the-directionality from using tree relations (e.g. "parent element") to using flat tree relations, as well?

[14:24:48.0744] <Eric Meyer>
I think it‚Äôs basically the same, with that one exception.  Shadow DOM directionality and language inheritance should be essentially ‚Äúflatten the tree, then act as described in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-directionality, except for this one exception with slots and hosts when the slot has no actual content‚Äù.

[14:25:18.0203] <Domenic>
Well, what we need is a spec for determining "the directionality of an element"; I don't see how you'd insert "flatten the tree" into that.

[14:25:36.0441] <Domenic>
I.e. we're not re-determining the directionality of the entire document tree every frame

[14:25:45.0488] <Domenic>
We need a mechanism for computing the directionality of a specific element when asked.

> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Well, what we need is a spec for determining "the directionality of an element"; I don't see how you'd insert "flatten the tree" into that.

I think I‚Äôm confused.  Is https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-directionality not that spec?

[08:10:24.0905] <annevk>
Eric Meyer: I think it's more about the how. What Domenic is asking for is an algorithm that is equivalent to what we have today. Given an element, it returns a direction.

That is the spec. However my understanding is that that algorithm gives incorrect results, currently, for elements in shadow trees. And so your goal is to modify that algorithm so that it returns correct results for elements in shadow trees.

Given that spec says ‚Äúany element‚Äù does that mean it‚Äôs known to apply to Shadow DOM trees?  Or is that part of the needed clarification?

[08:16:57.0311] <Domenic>
Yes, it currently applies to any element. It just gives wrong results (from what I understand) for some elements.

[08:17:14.0725] <Domenic>
Where by "wrong" I guess I mean "not according to latest CSSWG / implementer consensus"

[08:18:46.0402] <Eric Meyer>
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all that wrong, actually!  Except for certain edge cases with `slot` elements, which definitely does need to be clarified.  So I think my move is to add the bit about contentless `slot`s taking directionality from the host, and that should resolve it.  (I hope.)

[08:42:31.0416] <annevk>
Eric Meyer: if you want to operate in the flat tree presumably the tree walking is incorrect too?

I don‚Äôt understand, sorry.

[08:48:49.0018] <annevk>
Eric Meyer: e.g., the parent of a slotted node would be the shadow host, but it might have to look at the slot element it's slotted into instead?

[09:00:56.0402] <Eric Meyer>
That‚Äôs a good question and I need to take a few minutes to unspool it.  (If you have a specific structure in mind, I‚Äôm happy to work through it!)

I‚Äôve been working through this (with a lot of help from bkardell) and should have an answer soon.  But I do believe that we‚Äôve managed to avoid the flattened tree.

[11:53:38.0133] <bkardell>
well, we avoid trying to just saying "use the flat tree" I guess...conceptually I guess it's pretty similar, just how to adjust the algorithm in the spec to arrive there
