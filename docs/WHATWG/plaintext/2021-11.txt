As far as what‚Äôs documented in MDN:
```
$ rg --no-line-number --no-filename 'spec_url": ".+whatwg.org' ~/workspace/mdn/browser-compat-data/http/headers/ | awk NF | cut -d ":" -f2- | sort
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cross-origin-resource-policy-header",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-allow-credentials",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-allow-headers",

 "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#the-headers",
```
‚Ä¶ so from that, yeah, only Fetch and HTML (the Fullscreen one isn‚Äôt introducing any header)

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> Apart from Fetch and HTML, do we have other WHATWG standards that introduce their own HTTP headers?

annevk: FYI my _‚ÄúShow HTTP status code in CORS messages‚Äù_ patch landed in the WebKit sources https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/285145/webkit

[19:41:37.0031] <sideshowbarker>
so that‚Äôll soon be in a Safari TP release ‚Äî and then I guess in Safari 15.x in March or April

congrats! was somewhat expecting to see these error messages localized but no browser vendor does error messages correctly, so not surprised if that's the case. might need to make an account over now that you mention it

[23:36:07.0825] <sideshowbarker>
they are localized in some browsers at least

[23:39:31.0917] <DerekNonGeneric>
there are ways to localize error messages, but that doesn't seem to have happened in that changelog -- maybe they go back over it later? doubt it, but have seen great localization for error messages maybe twice

[23:42:11.0041] <DerekNonGeneric>
the two software projects were Git and TypeScript believe it or not

[03:37:24.0922] <smaug>
why are some tentative openUI tests being mixed with html tests?

[03:55:23.0854] <annevk>
smaug: the intention might be to upstream the feature to HTML?

[03:56:10.0886] <smaug>
I couldn't find any spec-like text for selectmenu

[03:56:24.0037] <smaug>
perhaps I looked at from wrong places

[03:56:52.0368] <annevk>
smaug: are they marked as tentative at least?

[03:56:58.0934] <smaug>
sure

[03:58:36.0929] <smaug>
seeing "the-selectmenu-element" here https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/ca3635d2be104d885837442cc5e7ada030d66b22/html/semantics/forms is a bit surprising. 

[05:03:39.0423] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
They're all marked `.tentative`

[05:03:51.0850] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
Maybe they didn't know you could do that to a complete directory too

[06:00:59.0368] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk, Jake Archibald: I was thinking re. the controller thingy (https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1329),  

maybe instead of returning a struct that fetch exported functions for, to return a struct with algorithm fields, that are set before returning the controller, kind of like how the different algorithms are kept in fetch params).

This way both fetch-params and the state are truly private, and the only thing returned/exported is terminate/abort/finalize or whatever method is operable after the fetch has started. WDYT?

[06:03:26.0453] <Jake Archibald>
Noam Rosenthal: I think algorithm fields are for cases where the algorithm is _set_ by some other spec, but annevk will know more
