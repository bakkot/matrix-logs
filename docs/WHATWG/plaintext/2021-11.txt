As far as what’s documented in MDN:
```
$ rg --no-line-number --no-filename 'spec_url": ".+whatwg.org' ~/workspace/mdn/browser-compat-data/http/headers/ | awk NF | cut -d ":" -f2- | sort
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cross-origin-resource-policy-header",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-allow-credentials",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-allow-headers",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-allow-methods",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-allow-origin",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-expose-headers",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-max-age",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-request-headers",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-request-method",
 "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#x-content-type-options-header",
 "https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#permissions-policy-integration",
 "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#autoplay-feature",
 "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#document-domain-feature",
 "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#coep",
 "https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#the-headers",
```
… so from that, yeah, only Fetch and HTML (the Fullscreen one isn’t introducing any header)

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> Apart from Fetch and HTML, do we have other WHATWG standards that introduce their own HTTP headers?

annevk: FYI my _“Show HTTP status code in CORS messages”_ patch landed in the WebKit sources https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/285145/webkit

[19:41:37.0031] <sideshowbarker>
so that’ll soon be in a Safari TP release — and then I guess in Safari 15.x in March or April
