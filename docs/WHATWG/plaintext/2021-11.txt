congrats! was somewhat expecting to see these error messages localized but no browser vendor does error messages correctly, so not surprised if that's the case. might need to make an account over now that you mention it

[23:36:07.0825] <sideshowbarker>
they are localized in some browsers at least

[23:39:31.0917] <DerekNonGeneric>
there are ways to localize error messages, but that doesn't seem to have happened in that changelog -- maybe they go back over it later? doubt it, but have seen great localization for error messages maybe twice

[23:42:11.0041] <DerekNonGeneric>
the two software projects were Git and TypeScript believe it or not

why are some tentative openUI tests being mixed with html tests?

I couldn't find any spec-like text for selectmenu

perhaps I looked at from wrong places

[03:56:52.0368] <annevk>
smaug: are they marked as tentative at least?

[03:56:58.0934] <smaug>
sure

[03:58:36.0929] <smaug>
seeing "the-selectmenu-element" here https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/ca3635d2be104d885837442cc5e7ada030d66b22/html/semantics/forms is a bit surprising. 

[05:03:39.0423] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
They're all marked `.tentative`

[05:03:51.0850] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
Maybe they didn't know you could do that to a complete directory too

[06:00:59.0368] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk, Jake Archibald: I was thinking re. the controller thingy (https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1329),  

maybe instead of returning a struct that fetch exported functions for, to return a struct with algorithm fields, that are set before returning the controller, kind of like how the different algorithms are kept in fetch params).

This way both fetch-params and the state are truly private, and the only thing returned/exported is terminate/abort/finalize or whatever method is operable after the fetch has started. WDYT?

[06:03:26.0453] <Jake Archibald>
Noam Rosenthal: I think algorithm fields are for cases where the algorithm is _set_ by some other spec, but annevk will know more

[06:05:09.0581] <annevk>
Yeah, generally concepts are "plain" structs and algorithms get everything they need passed as parameters

[06:05:22.0694] <Noam Rosenthal>
... Trying to prevent a situation where by putting the state information inside controller we make it "public", while what we want to publicize is only some methods to manipulate the fetch.

 * ... Trying to prevent a situation where by putting the state information inside controller we make it "public", while what we want to publicize is only some methods to manipulate the fetch.

[06:05:48.0608] <Jake Archibald>
Can't the controller just have the public data?

[06:05:52.0898] <annevk>
I think exposing the state of the fetch is reasonable

[06:06:00.0950] <Jake Archibald>
fetch params can have the private data

[06:06:10.0176] <annevk>
Assuming that we're talking about "ongoing" vs terminated

[06:06:21.0541] <Noam Rosenthal>
so it exposes state, and later cacheState and timing info

[06:06:31.0985] <Noam Rosenthal>
... which are needed when finalizing

[06:06:57.0453] <annevk>
Yeah, but we'd only set those on the controller when they are meant to become public (so we might duplicate them there, essentially)

[06:07:26.0817] <Noam Rosenthal>
I guess cacheState can only be set before fetch finale, right?

[06:07:32.0069] <Noam Rosenthal>
which would make this sort of work

[06:07:41.0646] <annevk>
As in, we'd write to those fields on "fetch params", and then at some point copy the whole lot over to the controller

[06:08:23.0107] <Noam Rosenthal>
yea, fetch finale would probably be where this happens, as that's where it's currently copied to the response

[06:09:00.0969] <annevk>
So we'll end up with some duplication, but it also clarifies things in a way

[06:09:06.0024] <Noam Rosenthal>
OK this makes more sense to me. Thanks!

[06:57:26.0401] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I haven't had a chance yet, but one thing we need to figure out is the interaction of this with service workers

[06:57:42.0778] <annevk>

[06:58:15.0988] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: service workers observe the termination for some things so they might need access to the controller or the state or some such

[06:58:36.0457] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: did you consider that already perhaps?

[07:12:43.0332] <Jake Archibald>
annevk: service worker is hand-waving this in a couple of places, so yeah, it's be great to switch this to an "abort when" based on some state

[07:31:27.0838] <Noam Rosenthal>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> Noam Rosenthal: I haven't had a chance yet, but one thing we need to figure out is the interaction of this with service workers

I will get more acquainted with this

[08:20:58.0888] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: cool! I think we need to expose the controller, essentially; I guess we only need to read state from it

[08:21:36.0271] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I'm not sure if that means we should stuff the controller on the request or just add an argument to "handle fetch", I guess the latter would be better

[08:21:55.0573] <annevk>
Anyway, this is a bit off the cuff

[08:48:29.0364] <Luca Casonato>
Domenic: In the streams spec, in `ReadableStreamPipeTo`, the spec says:
> If source.[[controller]] implements ReadableByteStreamController, let reader be either ! AcquireReadableStreamBYOBReader(source) or ! AcquireReadableStreamDefaultReader(source), at the user agent‚Äôs discretion.

(since the beginning of time: https://github.com/whatwg/streams/pull/512). What does this mean? In what cases should the user agent use which reader type? I can't find any docs in surrounding code snippets.

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> Noam Rosenthal: I'm not sure if that means we should stuff the controller on the request or just add an argument to "handle fetch", I guess the latter would be better

Definitely the latter. Seems natural to me that SW would get a "fetch controller" as a parameter and would be able to query if it is terminated

[10:54:33.0164] <Noam Rosenthal>
I would try to avoid associating more things with requests/responses, as those are transient serializable beings and when we associate "procedural" beings like fetch controller (or "an ongoing fetch") we make them confusing... (does this controller gets serialized or stored with the request? how?)

that's what happened with associating timing info to a response, where it got ambiguous in terms of caching and SW

[10:55:15.0396] <Noam Rosenthal>
adding a parameter to SW's fetch "handle fetch" is a clean solution to this problem

[11:14:45.0117] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk, Jake Archibald I think one thing that makes SW's "handle fetch" a bit different is that it asynchronously returns a response, rather than receive a `processResponse` callback algorithm or so.

If we'd change it to be the latter, the SW fetch could return its own controller and the main fetch could terminate it, rather than invert it to where SW has to check whether its caller ("the fetch instance") was terminated. 

[11:19:32.0817] <annevk>
I wonder what happens today if the abort happens after the service worker returned a response. Does the service worker still get notified? Perhaps that's just a state check on the service worker side though...

[11:20:06.0881] <annevk>
Making that interaction with the service worker non-blocking sounds reasonable, though I'm not entirely sure I see what it would buy us quite yet.

[11:22:23.0515] <annevk>
I guess having a controller for the fetch event would give an opportunity to not forward signals when it's too late anyway, but realistically you'd have to implement that check on the receiver side as well.

[11:23:28.0129] <annevk>
I should have time to give all this another look at tomorrow

[14:53:57.0863] <Domenic>
annevk: looks like removing "pair" broke Web IDL: https://github.com/whatwg/webidl/runs/4082229137?check_suite_focus=true

[23:17:08.0422] <annevk>
Thanks krosylight!

[01:10:43.0300] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
/me denies everything

[02:38:21.0859] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: so one thing that strikes me is that there's no forwarding of cancelation to a fetch initiated by the service worker

[02:39:13.0135] <Jake Archibald>
annevk: in which direction? As in, which side is listening for the cancelation, and which side is cancelling?

[02:39:18.0664] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: so if a document fetches A and the service worker fetches B and returns that, when exactly will it listen to aborting of A?

[02:40:31.0063] <Jake Archibald>
annevk: if the stream is cancelled, that part works right? For stuff that happens before that, I thought `fetchEvent.request.signal` could be used as an indicator

[02:40:39.0155] <annevk>
I guess only if it reuses the Request object in some manner, although I'm not sure how well that is defined

[02:41:20.0635] <annevk>
I think it there might be some race issues, but canceling the stream probably works, yeah

[02:43:00.0692] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I think one thing that might influence the design of the interaction with service workers is what we want to do with timing

[02:43:15.0579] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I'm not entirely sure what information needs to be exchanged

[02:43:42.0879] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: if that information would ideally be on a "service worker fetch event controller", I guess that's what we should add

[02:44:15.0284] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: as per your suggestion, and fetch would forward an abort to that controller

[02:45:35.0322] <annevk>
(It's a little weird that in JavaScript the cancelation is managed by AbortSignal on the Request, but that doesn't encompass all types of aborting that might happen, so maybe this is okay.)

[02:54:43.0751] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: regarding timing, going forward there shouldn't be interaction. It's part of why I want to make things more explicit there

[02:55:31.0035] <Noam Rosenthal>
*only* a fetch would keep its timing info and report it. later of course we can add more things to the controller.

[02:56:05.0175] <Noam Rosenthal>
(the service worker timing is only relevant to navigation timing, and in that case the timing is not part of a fetch but is queried directly from the service worker)

[02:56:53.0769] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: oh, I thought we also needed to expose Cache API timing and things like that

[02:57:24.0295] <Noam Rosenthal>
for the fetch, we need to expose "finalize and report timing info"

[02:57:41.0914] <Noam Rosenthal>
cache state can be read from the response

[02:57:50.0498] <Noam Rosenthal>
there's nothing new we need to expose from service worker

[02:58:25.0469] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: so that means that if there is service worker the timing information ends up being mostly opaque, right?

[02:58:36.0158] <Noam Rosenthal>
it's reported inside the service worker

[02:58:47.0799] <Noam Rosenthal>
so you can do `performance.getEntries` from within service worker code etc

[02:58:59.0441] <Noam Rosenthal>
but it's opaque to the caller fetch

[02:59:42.0087] <Noam Rosenthal>
it felt like exposing that information twice mainly creates ambiguities

[03:00:27.0043] <Noam Rosenthal>
... that's why I didn't want that information on `response` which is a strange object that gets passed around and stored

[03:00:43.0195] <annevk>
thanks, sgtm

Hi folks, had some good successes using the WebIDL bindings to implement bindings between mruby and browser APIs. The `@webref/idl` package made this especially easy, thanks for providing that.

While generating bindings works well, it feels like there are some fairly severe issues with this approach for a dynamic language. My current generated bindings are 800kb, which is non-trivial for a webapp, especially on top of the mruby interpreter and emscripten runtime. This isn't too bad with caching but will still be a show-stopper for many users.

I was wondering if there's ever been any interest in providing a JavaScript API that can be used to load Web IDL bindings directly from the browser at runtime. This would allow dynamic languages to lazily bind to Web APIs as necessary, saving on the need to send and process all bindings upfront.

[21:12:21.0668] <Widdershin>
As it stands, I think I'll have to opt to create bindings for JavaScript objects at runtime based on reflection (or just depressing `method_missing` hacks), which is a shame since I do really like having classes generated with all the proper metadata.

Since I live mostly in mozilla-central, I've got used to so simple build  + "pr creation" setup with ./mach and moz-phab üòâ

[03:40:22.0850] <annevk>
And generally build tools beyond make are optional, there's a service for all of them (or you can just create PRs and see if things work)

smaug: right yeah, git/GitHub knowledge is assumed at the moment... I'm using GitHub Desktop myself for some of the actions and it's quite nice if you don't mind a GUI

[03:43:45.0791] <smaug>
I wasn't thinking to include all the github instructions, although some common practices might not be a bad idea, if there are things which happen to fit into spec writing process particularly well

[03:48:22.0405] <annevk>
Perhaps a "Your first PR" list of steps that's linked prominently from each README? (With HTML perhaps having its own list of steps for reasons.)

[03:53:35.0980] <smaug>
Something like that would be great, at least for me, since all my spec prs are basically the first ones, given how rarely I do them.

smaug: I filed https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/232 as a start

[04:04:05.0431] <smaug>
thanks!

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> Cool! As long as there's some WHATWG green and orangered in there I'm happy üòä

Honestly I've never been so sure about the orangered :)

So apparently Chromium's UTF-16 decoder skips the replacement character for truncated sequences on fetches (that is, for page loads and XHR, but not for `TextDecoder`) "for compatibility reasons"

annevk: hsivonen Is this a thing that was ever discussed?
