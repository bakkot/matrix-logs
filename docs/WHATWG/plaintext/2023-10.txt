hi, any chance anybody could point me at the place in navigation specification where document's url need to be updated when same-document navigation happens (for example https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#navigate-fragid)?

it's actually seems like a spec bug because by the time popstate/hashchange event is fired on step 13 (update document for history step application) document's url should be updated but non of previous steps does that.
