hi, any chance anybody could point me at the place in navigation specification where document's url need to be updated when same-document navigation happens (for example https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#navigate-fragid)?

it's actually seems like a spec bug because by the time popstate/hashchange event is fired on step 13 (update document for history step application) document's url should be updated but non of previous steps does that.

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#url-and-history-update-steps step 8 does it for popstate/hashchange/navigation API intercept

Did we somehow mess it up for fragment navigation?

Please file an issue

TabAtkins: not sure if this is a problem, but when I updated WHATWG's bikeshed boilerplate for a change in new issue URLs, it was picked up automatically without me having to generate the manifest

TabAtkins: I have now updated the manifest as well, but that makes it seem redundant
