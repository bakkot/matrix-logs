currently if you have multiple <details> with the same [name] the browser will treat the group as an accordion. github has this behavior where if you're on the page for a commit or the changed files of a pr and hold alt/option and then click the caret then all the dropdowns in the group with open/close together. is there an open issue for this/any interest?

Sounds interesting to me (as someone who implemented the existing details@name accordion/grouping stuff in an engine)

[00:04:05.0084] <sideshowbarker>
…and there’s no existing open issue for it as far as I know

are deprecated features tracked anywhere? For example, the MimeType and MimeTypeArray interfaces which are deprecated but I don't see represented in the current webref repo's IDL files. I presume deprecated interfaces are removed?

[06:29:27.0681] <Brian Cardarella>
well, it does look like they are in the html idl

[06:30:24.0663] <Brian Cardarella>
I guess the real question is are deprecated features expected to still be represented in the webref repo? 

[06:39:45.0000] <annevk>
Brian Cardarella: yes, everything that's defined should probably be in there. Maybe things can have annotations.
