currently if you have multiple <details> with the same [name] the browser will treat the group as an accordion. github has this behavior where if you're on the page for a commit or the changed files of a pr and hold alt/option and then click the caret then all the dropdowns in the group with open/close together. is there an open issue for this/any interest?
