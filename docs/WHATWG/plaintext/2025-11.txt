currently if you have multiple <details> with the same [name] the browser will treat the group as an accordion. github has this behavior where if you're on the page for a commit or the changed files of a pr and hold alt/option and then click the caret then all the dropdowns in the group with open/close together. is there an open issue for this/any interest?

Sounds interesting to me (as someone who implemented the existing details@name accordion/grouping stuff in an engine)

[00:04:05.0084] <sideshowbarker>
…and there’s no existing open issue for it as far as I know

are deprecated features tracked anywhere? For example, the MimeType and MimeTypeArray interfaces which are deprecated but I don't see represented in the current webref repo's IDL files. I presume deprecated interfaces are removed?

[06:29:27.0681] <Brian Cardarella>
well, it does look like they are in the html idl

[06:30:24.0663] <Brian Cardarella>
I guess the real question is are deprecated features expected to still be represented in the webref repo? 

[06:39:45.0000] <annevk>
Brian Cardarella: yes, everything that's defined should probably be in there. Maybe things can have annotations.

`div` is now allowed as a descendant of `select`?

[00:20:05.0746] <sideshowbarker>
Do current parsers actually support that?

[00:20:24.0711] <sideshowbarker>
The Gecko/validator.nu parser doesn’t seem to 

[00:23:00.0748] <sideshowbarker>
trying the HTML checker with this:
```html
<!doctype html><html lang=en><meta charset=utf-8>
<title>select with hr and div children</title>
<select id="theme-select">
  <option value="light">Light</option>
  <option value="dark">Dark</option>
  <hr>
  <div class="group-label">Custom themes</div>
  <option value="solarized">Solarized</option>
  <option value="dracula">Dracula</option>
</select>
```
I get parse-error messages:

"file:/Users/mike/workspace/validator/tests/html/elements/select/hr-and-div-children-isvalid.html":7.3-7.27: error: Stray start tag “div”.

hmm yeah also in Firefox — the DOM looks like this:
```html
<select id="theme-select">
  <option value="light">Light</option>
  <option value="dark">Dark</option>
  <hr>
  Custom themes
  <option value="solarized">Solarized</option>
  <option value="dracula">Dracula</option>
</select>
```

[00:26:26.0013] <sideshowbarker>
hmm yeah same DOM in Safari — no `div` in the DOM

[00:27:15.0821] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: that's a very recent change; I think Chrome might have shipped it. I did implement these aspects in WebKit, but nothing shipped as-of-yet.

[00:27:33.0313] <sideshowbarker>
ah OK

[00:28:08.0061] <sideshowbarker>
so I guess I may need to implement in the vnu HTML parser — or wait til Henri or somebody does

[00:28:35.0131] <sideshowbarker>
Do you know if there’s an open gecko bug for it?

incidentelly I've seen dl/dt/dd got similar changes too, but I haven't checked if that was implemented

I think those were just conformance changes. The parser wasn't changed for those elements.

[05:07:14.0754] <Dominic Farolino>
annevk & smaug are we OK marking Menu Elements (https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11729) as stage 1? This was raised a few WHATNOTs ago

[05:28:22.0363] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: okay from our side.

[06:05:17.0889] <smaug>
that is ok

sideshowbarker: you around? The “Running the HTML checker…” part of the WHATWG build pipeline is failing on a 404.

[23:14:02.0280] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: https://github.com/whatwg/compression/pull/79 and https://github.com/whatwg/cookiestore/pull/290

[23:30:03.0907] <annevk>
I suppose I can still merge and we just won't have validation this time around. I might do that given that these are overdue.
