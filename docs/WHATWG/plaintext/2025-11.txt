currently if you have multiple <details> with the same [name] the browser will treat the group as an accordion. github has this behavior where if you're on the page for a commit or the changed files of a pr and hold alt/option and then click the caret then all the dropdowns in the group with open/close together. is there an open issue for this/any interest?

are deprecated features tracked anywhere? For example, the MimeType and MimeTypeArray interfaces which are deprecated but I don't see represented in the current webref repo's IDL files. I presume deprecated interfaces are removed?

[06:29:27.0681] <Brian Cardarella>
well, it does look like they are in the html idl

[06:30:24.0663] <Brian Cardarella>
I guess the real question is are deprecated features expected to still be represented in the webref repo? 

[06:39:45.0000] <annevk>
Brian Cardarella: yes, everything that's defined should probably be in there. Maybe things can have annotations.

[04:39:22.0883] <sideshowbarker>
Apparently it then makes a request to validator.nu?

[04:40:33.0704] <sideshowbarker>
If so, we should change that to have it fall back to validator.w3.org/nu instead

jjaschke (out until Dec 1), smaug, if you're around at TPAC we can perhaps do some navigation API whiteboarding to resolve some of the pending messy issues. I understand farre won't be there unfortunately. Anyone else who's around is welcome of course (e.g. Dominic Farolino)

[02:54:02.0054] <smaug>
I'll be there

[02:56:43.0135] <smaug>
I don't think wait-for-all is that messy. The spec is mostly good in that case, and API is part of interop, so "encouraging browsers to precisely match the web standards " 😉  But yeah, that issue, and perhaps others too should be discussed.

[02:57:45.0604] <smaug>
And we should also discuss about that "encouraging browsers to precisely match the web standards " part.

[03:08:04.0988] <Noam Rosenthal>
It's messy when there is a divergence between WPTs and spec which in some cases begs the question of which one is correct. 

[03:09:39.0408] <Noam Rosenthal>
anyway, I saw that the process/meta question is already on the agenda requests but what I want is to spend a bit of time on the specifics and make sure we make the right decisions for users/web-devs.

[03:10:58.0868] <smaug>
Sure. 

[03:14:52.0583] <farre>
I must admit that I'm surprised by the amount of divergence

[03:18:19.0307] <Noam Rosenthal>
I wasn't involved when it was spec'ed/implemented but I remember that there was a huge hanging PR with a lot of details for quite a while, and the prototype was progressing alongside the spec. So it caught me by surprise as well but also it's not totally unexpected given the complexity of this API

[03:18:40.0115] <farre>
Or Session History and Navigation in genereal

[03:18:42.0090] <farre>
* Or Session History and Navigation in general

[03:21:11.0632] <Noam Rosenthal>
Yea exactly. I am curious as to whether this is an outlier or there are other recent examples of this kind of divergence/complexity. Answering this can help the meta conversation.

[04:26:45.0066] <smaug>
Trusted types was perhaps a bit similar, though there through some great collaboration specs and implementations got into a lot better shape. But it did mean filing spec issues and fixing them when the spec wasn't implementable and also writing tests following the spec, not the first implementation.

[04:36:47.0837] <Noam Rosenthal>
Yea I see that TrustedTypes landed in 2019, and there were some recent spec-alignment changes

[04:38:27.0628] <smaug>
"some" 🙂 And lots of new tests

[03:38:23.0151] <Zoltán Kondér>
I fail to understand why whatwg is focusing on various API's in different browsers. I do protecting my API's to prevent fingerprinting. To me anything that needs the API to work is a threat and it must be contained with urgency. I hardly see any discussion about HTML here it's more like developing full applications that will use the browsers capabilities but completely disregarding the dangers of this. In my opinion anything that depends on specific API's in the browsers is a significant threat.

[03:54:38.0017] <Zoltán Kondér>
Far as I know W3C and others do working on prevention of fingerprinting, I never seen any discussion regarding this issue in whatwg. The more API's are there which implemented by browsers the bigger the threat. I do not support more and more API's and more and more proposal to depend on them especially not when fingerprinting and privacy is completely left out of discussion.

[04:03:55.0491] <Zoltán Kondér>
Probably the biggest most meaningful standard would be a new high-level API that mediates or annotates other APIs. One for all - all for one.

This way it is possible to protect users privacy, resist fingerprinting etc. 

Pretty sure a lot of browsers would implement it. 

The API itself would be difficult but not impossible. Once there is a working version the development would be easier.

[10:45:19.0538] <dveditz>
There's not much discussion of HTML because there aren't many newly-proposed declarative HTML features, and cross-browser compatibility/ambiguity problems are largely addressed or at least known and added to web platform tests.

[10:46:37.0552] <dveditz>
Most of the activity in non-scripted features is happening in the very active CSS working group, but that's hosted by W3C so it doesn't come up here in WHATWG

[10:48:29.0395] <dveditz>
And most of the proposals to restrict capabilities of existing APIs are happening in the Privacy WG and CG. Often by the same people who are in this channel!

Looks like many (all?) agenda+ items for WHATNOT got the label well before WHATUP, and most of them were discussed last week. 

[01:25:23.0334] <smaug>
Hmm, some pages are getting mad with cross site iframes (mostly ads etc.). Easily 50 different sites, and if implementation uses separate process per site and process overhead + ad page is ~20MB (which seems to be the case in couple of browsers), one has ~1GB overhead from ads. Easily.

[01:32:30.0878] <smaug>
We should limit the number of sites a tab can contain simultaneously. Let's say 5 🙂 

[06:06:12.0958] <annevk>
If anyone has any opinion on specification singleton types (success, failure, etc.) that is different from what https://github.com/whatwg/infra/pull/687 attempts to do please speak up now.

[07:14:05.0994] <Dominic Farolino>
emilio: What do you make of the tests in https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/interaction/focus/processing-model/focusVisible.html#L59-L60? It seems like they expect `focusVisible: false` to force `:focus-visible` to not match, but the spec text only indicates that `focusVisible: true` forces `:focus-visible`, but can't *unforce* it? Am I right in thinking there's a mismatch here?

[07:38:13.0252] <cwilso>
Gah.  I have failed to get back ahead of the curve.  I don't see anything new agenda+ for today; cancel?

[07:44:33.0061] <annevk>
