Sorry, yes, Chrome's behaviour for non-special URLs is currently incorrect, but we're working on it. You can star this bug https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40063064 to be notified when there are updates.

When trying to build the HTML spec in my macOS (Sonoma 14.4.1) environment, I was getting the following error:
>   = note: ld: library 'System' not found
>          clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

To fix it I needed to do this:

> export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib"

I wonder if we should document this

Looking for mathml content in httparchive but it's almost entirely this: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/6e650109999e5f483fcb910ff20fe8148a566cb2/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/server/ReactFizzConfigDOM.js#L3934 (cc bkardell )

https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4403 might be better. Maybe mathml on the web usually isn't in markup but generated from script?

I really only know one website: https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/

[04:16:17.0353] <annevk>
There used to be a website that collected all of them, but I don't remember that one

yeah not surprising since the http archive is mainly getting home pages and even sites dedicated to math and science don't usually put math on the home page :). There are sites like https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/, for example..

[05:48:13.0531] <bkardell>
and wikipedia has many millions but currently (because of core interop issues - that's why we're here) still doesn't use it for rendering, only for a11y -- so like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence has 30 mathml instances related to images of math - ick

[05:51:20.0669] <bkardell>
zcorpan: we have a few very rich sources - is there something you're trying to answer specifically that I can help with or just generally poking around?

bkardell: trying to get a sense of how much content uses `href` and on which elements

ah well you can see _some_ discussion in that issue (there are some related emails or issues with more on this same topic, but it's pretty generally aligned with this) https://github.com/w3c/mathml-core/issues/142#issuecomment-1082772082

[05:56:37.0224] <bkardell>
> in the full collection there, there are 30 <mrow with href as opposed 97549 <mi and 3226 <mn

[05:58:06.0090] <bkardell>
the thing is most of the corpuses are in XML toolchains that they are open to some transforms on - many things have been adapted for mathml-core already

[06:00:10.0306] <bkardell>
That's why I am saying if the group is like "we should prefer mrow because then links still work" I am like, well, only a tiny tiny fraction and the rest you have to transform anyways - let's just fix it properly

[06:03:51.0929] <zcorpan>
Right

[06:58:31.0946] <bkardell>
> <@zcorpan:mozilla.org> Right

 I do think the a11y tools might be a pretty compelling argument (many are already fine so we'd have to see how difficult the other two are I guess)  - I am just trying to make sure `<a>` gets a fair shot is all because i think it is clearly the best answer if possible...But I can also accept if it is not, it's not a hill I want to get seriously injured on
