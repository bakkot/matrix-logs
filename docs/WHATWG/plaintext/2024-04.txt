Sorry, yes, Chrome's behaviour for non-special URLs is currently incorrect, but we're working on it. You can star this bug https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40063064 to be notified when there are updates.

When trying to build the HTML spec in my macOS (Sonoma 14.4.1) environment, I was getting the following error:
>   = note: ld: library 'System' not found
>          clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

To fix it I needed to do this:

> export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib"

I wonder if we should document this

Looking for mathml content in httparchive but it's almost entirely this: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/6e650109999e5f483fcb910ff20fe8148a566cb2/packages/react-dom-bindings/src/server/ReactFizzConfigDOM.js#L3934 (cc bkardell )

https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/4403 might be better. Maybe mathml on the web usually isn't in markup but generated from script?
