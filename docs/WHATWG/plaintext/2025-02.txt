Ok

Domenic or annevk: Sometimes, the HTML spec uses <i> where I would have expected <var> (E.g. 'same-origin fallback flag') Is this described somewhere?

[14:13:50.0521] <jmdyck>
There's some overlap with 'a reference from one algorithm to a parameter of another algorithm', but differences either way.

We do use <i> for references from one algorithm to a parameter of another algorithm. A modern example of that is all the references to optional named parameters of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#navigate .

[17:28:12.0341] <Domenic>
Same-origin fallback flag looks like an old version of that before we had our modern conventions (which include a <dfn><var> at the declaration site and an <a><i> at the call site)

[17:30:20.0555] <Domenic>
Separately, HTML has lots of random <i> usage from a former editor that I don't really understand, e.g. missing value default/invalid value default, mutable, etc.

Is there a particular reason why you can't call .showPopover() an open modal dialog, but on an open non-modal dialog it works? Seems like it should probably throw in both cases?

Are the children changed steps and post-connection steps defined for SVG's `<script>` element anywhere? https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10188 - only seems to cover HTML's `<script>`

I doubt it. There is some general understanding that most of what applies for HTML's script applies to SVG's script, but the SVG script specification is not really maintained.

Yeah about SVG, these days even if you took time to write up an SVG PR, there’s nobody who’s even going to review it. Unless you can also somehow supply your own reviewer — e.g., recruit another someone else whose familiar with an SVG implementation in an engine (from having written it or wrote patches for it), and get them to review your PR

foolip (or anyone else who maintains the fullscreen spec): Hi! Can you review https://github.com/whatwg/fullscreen/pull/243 ?

[11:56:36.0259] <oxiidaw>

[11:56:49.0087] <oxiidaw>
is there a way I can track this down and get updates?
