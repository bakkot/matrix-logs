Ok

[13:40:40.0907] <jmdyck>
Domenic or annevk: Sometimes, the HTML spec uses <i> where I would have expected <var> (E.g. 'same-origin fallback flag') Is this described somewhere?

[14:13:50.0521] <jmdyck>
There's some overlap with 'a reference from one algorithm to a parameter of another algorithm', but differences either way.

We do use <i> for references from one algorithm to a parameter of another algorithm. A modern example of that is all the references to optional named parameters of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#navigate .

[17:28:12.0341] <Domenic>
Same-origin fallback flag looks like an old version of that before we had our modern conventions (which include a <dfn><var> at the declaration site and an <a><i> at the call site)

[17:30:20.0555] <Domenic>
Separately, HTML has lots of random <i> usage from a former editor that I don't really understand, e.g. missing value default/invalid value default, mutable, etc.

Is there a particular reason why you can't call .showPopover() an open modal dialog, but on an open non-modal dialog it works? Seems like it should probably throw in both cases?

Are the children changed steps and post-connection steps defined for SVG's `<script>` element anywhere? https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10188 - only seems to cover HTML's `<script>`


2025-02-04
[16:45:44.0535] <Domenic>
I doubt it. There is some general understanding that most of what applies for HTML's script applies to SVG's script, but the SVG script specification is not really maintained.

Yeah about SVG, these days even if you took time to write up an SVG PR, there’s nobody who’s even going to review it. Unless you can also somehow supply your own reviewer — e.g., recruit another someone else whose familiar with an SVG implementation in an engine (from having written it or wrote patches for it), and get them to review your PR

foolip (or anyone else who maintains the fullscreen spec): Hi! Can you review https://github.com/whatwg/fullscreen/pull/243 ?

[11:56:36.0259] <oxiidaw>
im super exited about https://drafts.csswg.org/css-borders-4/#corner-shape-rendering

[11:56:49.0087] <oxiidaw>
is there a way I can track this down and get updates?

[12:04:38.0373] <Noam Rosenthal>
Hi @oxiidaw:matrix.org, Glad you're excited about it!
Follow the `css-borders-4` label in CSSWG (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels/css-borders-4), or the following for chromium: https://chromestatus.com/feature/5357329815699456 /  https://issues.chromium.org/issues/393145930

* Hi @oxiidaw:matrix.org, Glad you're excited about it!
Follow the `css-borders-4` label in CSSWG (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels/css-borders-4) for the spec, or the following for chromium: https://chromestatus.com/feature/5357329815699456 /  https://issues.chromium.org/issues/393145930). Not sure about Gecko/WebKit issue numbers yet

Hi all, I'm currently implementing popovers closing each other in Ladybird and I'm a bit confused about the `while` loops in the "close entire popover list" and "hide popover stack until" algorithms. They boil down to repeatedly hiding the last popover in popoverList, but this seems like it would be an infinite loop unless the spec expects the popoverList to be dynamically updated?

I'm guessing the x.com/htmlstandard account stopped working when Twitter changed API access? Even if it weren't for [gestures vaguely at everything] I don't think a link to a source for "updates" which hasn't seen an update for a year and a half belongs in the header: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10993

[15:23:28.0378] <Meghan Denny>
is there a mastodon or bsky account to replace it with?

Twitter discussion in https://github.com/whatwg/participate.whatwg.org/issues/351 and https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/318 .

[21:45:18.0558] <gingeh>
I've now encountered failures which are resolved by dynamically updating the given popoverList. If this is really required then the spec steps should be changed to reflect that.

[06:40:57.0100] <Eric Portis (he/him)>

I hope you have filed a bug on the issue tracker instead of just chatting about this issue?

[15:10:45.0714] <sideshowbarker>
Domenic: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10996 but don’t know if it’s yet been updated with the additional info from that last comment

[15:11:58.0345] <gingeh>
That's for a separate problem, I haven't opened an issue for this one yet because I was hoping for some confirmation that I wasn't just misinterpreting the instructions

[15:11:58.0480] <Domenic>
Great, will try to get people to comment during the WHATNOT meeting that's ongoing right now

[15:12:05.0871] <Domenic>
Oh, OK

[15:13:01.0442] <gingeh>
I'll open an issue for that now

[15:25:48.0271] <gingeh>

Thanks. We got some attention to those in the meeting and it looks like they're at the top of mfreed's plate for tomorrow.

[16:04:45.0287] <gingeh>
Thank you so much!

[17:21:01.0791] <smaug>
Domenic: btw, related to SharedWorkers, I thought Chrome on  Android doesn't even support them. But perhaps this unload thingie would be a reason to support?

[17:33:50.0525] <Domenic>
Yep, it would be, indeed.

[06:03:48.0340] <smaug>
and I can possibly blame my self for not catching that in some review

Hello, just joined, I wanted to ask something about dom rendering

[11:06:23.0816] <Valery>
This is purely an idea, but looking at Game Development I was looking for something like Object Instancing to be a part of DOM as well. I can't give exact examples where this optimization is decisive, but I certainly remember having issues with performance because of many **the same** elements (with **the same** huge trees) were presented in the document.

So I want to ask what do you think about having a kind of mirroring a node, so it can be displayed multiple times while processing it only once. Or maybe this is overoptimization, not relevant? Sorry if I don't know something, thanks in advance.
