Ok

Domenic or annevk: Sometimes, the HTML spec uses <i> where I would have expected <var> (E.g. 'same-origin fallback flag') Is this described somewhere?

[14:13:50.0521] <jmdyck>
There's some overlap with 'a reference from one algorithm to a parameter of another algorithm', but differences either way.

We do use <i> for references from one algorithm to a parameter of another algorithm. A modern example of that is all the references to optional named parameters of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#navigate .

[17:28:12.0341] <Domenic>
Same-origin fallback flag looks like an old version of that before we had our modern conventions (which include a <dfn><var> at the declaration site and an <a><i> at the call site)

[17:30:20.0555] <Domenic>
Separately, HTML has lots of random <i> usage from a former editor that I don't really understand, e.g. missing value default/invalid value default, mutable, etc.

Is there a particular reason why you can't call .showPopover() an open modal dialog, but on an open non-modal dialog it works? Seems like it should probably throw in both cases?

Are the children changed steps and post-connection steps defined for SVG's `<script>` element anywhere? https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10188 - only seems to cover HTML's `<script>`
