Ok

Domenic or annevk: Sometimes, the HTML spec uses <i> where I would have expected <var> (E.g. 'same-origin fallback flag') Is this described somewhere?

There's some overlap with 'a reference from one algorithm to a parameter of another algorithm', but differences either way.

We do use <i> for references from one algorithm to a parameter of another algorithm. A modern example of that is all the references to optional named parameters of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#navigate .

Same-origin fallback flag looks like an old version of that before we had our modern conventions (which include a <dfn><var> at the declaration site and an <a><i> at the call site)
