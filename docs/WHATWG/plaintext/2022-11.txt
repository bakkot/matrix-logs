Patrick Meenan: we broke "ancestor browsing contexts" intentionally in https://github.com/whatwg/html/commit/0a97a81da77bc4cb0ab5b16420605ca001ff5b17 . What spec is this? We will work to update it.

Domenic: Fullscreen is broken then too

I should be able to squeeze out a fullscreen fix in the next hour or so

Wasn't so bad: https://github.com/whatwg/fullscreen/pull/208 but needs some exports from HTML.

How do we use the "needs implementer interest" label? Do we remove it when there's one implementer interested, or two?

foolip: two
