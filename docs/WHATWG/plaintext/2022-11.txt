Patrick Meenan: we broke "ancestor browsing contexts" intentionally in https://github.com/whatwg/html/commit/0a97a81da77bc4cb0ab5b16420605ca001ff5b17 . What spec is this? We will work to update it.

Domenic: Fullscreen is broken then too

[00:13:49.0294] <Domenic>
I should be able to squeeze out a fullscreen fix in the next hour or so

[00:45:29.0619] <Domenic>
Wasn't so bad: https://github.com/whatwg/fullscreen/pull/208 but needs some exports from HTML.

How do we use the "needs implementer interest" label? Do we remove it when there's one implementer interested, or two?

This was from the fetch spec.  PR showing the same issue here: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1523

Should the implementers comment on the issues in the relevant specs?  Chrome has shipped Priority Hints and Mozilla is working on implementing it and there are issues on both the HTML and Fetch trackers (PR's inbound). Just need to know who needs to comment where to properly reflect the implementors interest.

[07:57:18.0696] <foolip>
Patrick Meenan: if implementation is in progress in Gecko, then cc'ing the person working on that on the two issues is a good first step. Ask if they'd be supportive of the changes.

[07:57:38.0159] <jgraham>
I might be imagining things, but did someone at some point make a graphviz-type visualisation of the fetch spec?

[08:02:45.0258] <jgraham>
Hmm, there's https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eUtpVsuoPPPLzl6ccNoaUH9Rwmd63hgCboVh-gDLkiI/edit#slide=id.g2c389e7de3_0_17 but that's now 5 years old

[08:16:33.0074] <annevk>
If there's an easy way to generate such a diagram and we can be sure it can be updated 10 years later I'm all ears

[08:20:39.0267] <jgraham>
Hmm, well in theory bikeshed has enough information to generate it. Maybe one could even hack something together with the HTML output, because at some level it's just a graph of links, but limited to the ones that only point to internal algorithms.

[08:33:57.0409] <annevk>
I mean I'm happy to duplicate work, just need some kind of tool that helps with it, makes it accessible, and makes updates somewhat easy.

[16:18:21.0809] <Domenic>
I feel like the hard part of these things is placing the boxes. Every tool I've tried (including implementing one algorithm I found in a paper by hand) has done poorly.

does anyone know what this means (looking at the clipboard api)

> The length attribute must return zero if the object is in the disabled mode; otherwise it must return the number of items in the drag data store item list.

"disabled mode" is not defined anywhere that i can find lol

 * does anyone know what this means (looking at the clipboard api)

"disabled mode" is not defined anywhere that i can find lol

[17:13:51.0011] <snek>
for some extra spicy context, i am observing the length be 0 *specifically* when copying an image in firefox and then pasting it in electron

[18:51:50.0732] <Domenic>
It should be defined, if it is not, sounds like a spec bug.

[19:47:31.0246] <Domenic>
Patrick Meenan: annevk : I will work on fixing Fetch to not have that error.

sideshowbarker: did the validator update to complain differently about <hgroup>?

[00:52:20.0222] <annevk>
I just got an error for File System and https://github.com/whatwg/whatwg.org/issues/401 isn't fixed yet

[00:53:04.0902] <annevk>
Need to run a few errands now, but we probably need to resolve this one way or another as this breaks everything if correct

[01:45:26.0571] <sideshowbarker>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> sideshowbarker: did the validator update to complain differently about <hgroup>?

yes it did, to align with the current spec requirements after the big outline-algorithm patch, which also changed the `hgroup` restrictions

> <@annevk:matrix.org> I just got an error for File System and https://github.com/whatwg/whatwg.org/issues/401 isn't fixed yet

 * ah yeah I still need to write up that HTML spec patch. Can do for other specs too

[02:11:41.0076] <Domenic>
Great news!

[02:13:58.0484] <Domenic>
Where is the issue where we were tracking that? I don't have much time before dinner is going to start but I can try to experiment a bit and jot down notes...

if you mean the `hgroup` issue, it‚Äôs https://github.com/whatwg/whatwg.org/issues/401

[02:15:29.0286] <Domenic>
Right, it was linked minutes earlier, I am a dummy :)

[02:15:38.0190] <sideshowbarker>
no worries :)

[02:16:54.0117] <sideshowbarker>
hey, by the way, looking at https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/ I notice that it shows ‚ÄúBikeshed 47.2%‚Äù in the area that lists which languages the repo sources are in

[02:17:13.0315] <sideshowbarker>
‚Ä¶which seems pretty cool. I guess Tab managed to get Bikeshed added to Linguist

[02:18:52.0879] <sideshowbarker>
so we might want to update the `.gitattributes` files in WHATWG repo files to no longer map `.bs` sources to HTML. In which case, they will instead just get automatically recognized as Bikeshed

[02:19:15.0873] <sideshowbarker>
it‚Äôs a minor thing, but kind of a cool and easy way to get Bikeshed some extra love
