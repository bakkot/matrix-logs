Hello

[01:01:57.0914] <sideshowbarker>
`Transfer-Encoding` seems to be the only HTTP fields/header that’s not defined in the core HTTP Semantics spec, https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html, but instead in the HTTP/1.1 Syntax spec, https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html#field.transfer-encoding

Does anybody know why that is?

Why couldn’t it instead be specified in the Semantics spec along with all the other fields/headers?

hmm, I guess maybe because it’s not supported in HTTP/2 (and likely not in HTTP/3) — and so in that sense, it’s not part of the shared Semantics of core HTTP but instead it’s something that only works in the HTTP/1.1 syntax…

annevk: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1469 is highest-priority fetch PR if you could find some time soon :)

It looks like our next HTML triage meeting conflicts with TPAC. I'm thinking of skipping this instance, unless others disagree.
