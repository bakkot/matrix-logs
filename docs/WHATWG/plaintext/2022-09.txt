Hello

[01:01:57.0914] <sideshowbarker>
`Transfer-Encoding` seems to be the only HTTP fields/header that’s not defined in the core HTTP Semantics spec, https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html, but instead in the HTTP/1.1 Syntax spec, https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html#field.transfer-encoding

Does anybody know why that is?

Why couldn’t it instead be specified in the Semantics spec along with all the other fields/headers?
