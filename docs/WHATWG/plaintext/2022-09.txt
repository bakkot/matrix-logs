Hello

[01:01:57.0914] <sideshowbarker>
`Transfer-Encoding` seems to be the only HTTP fields/header that’s not defined in the core HTTP Semantics spec, https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html, but instead in the HTTP/1.1 Syntax spec, https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html#field.transfer-encoding

Does anybody know why that is?

Why couldn’t it instead be specified in the Semantics spec along with all the other fields/headers?

[01:24:34.0116] <sideshowbarker>

[01:30:49.0416] <sideshowbarker>
hmm, I guess maybe because it’s not supported in HTTP/2 (and likely not in HTTP/3) — and so in that sense, it’s not part of the shared Semantics of core HTTP but instead it’s something that only works in the HTTP/1.1 syntax…

annevk: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1469 is highest-priority fetch PR if you could find some time soon :)

[09:30:37.0718] <Panos Astithas>
It looks like our next HTML triage meeting conflicts with TPAC. I'm thinking of skipping this instance, unless others disagree.

Domenic Do you mind if I start working on https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7996? It took me a while to understand how "wait until it asynchronously complete" and "custom perform the fetch steps" work, and I would be happy to help replacing them with more explicit constructs.

[05:24:19.0307] <Andreu Botella>
Has anyone else noticed that HTML's section on "killing scripts" only focuses on killing script or module evaluation, rather than the evaluation of a callback?

Sure, that would be great!

annevk: FWIW, it looks a lot like https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/cross-origin-embedder-policy/non-initial-about-blank.https.html passes in Gecko for the wrong reason.

[06:01:45.0452] <hsivonen>
As for pass in other browsers, I'm currently trying to locate spec text that would explain why going from lack of `src` to `src="about:blank"` should trigger a navigation from the initial `about:blank` to a non-initial `about:blank`.

[06:09:28.0656] <hsivonen>
So, I take it that a change in `src` triggers a navigation even if the URL resolves to the same URL that's already the URL of the current doc in the iframe.

So I’m writing the intro of an MDN page for the Paint Timing API and want the intro the put the Paint Timing API on context relative to the Largest Contentful Paint API.

[00:00:14.0878] <sideshowbarker>
Would it be accurate for me to make it basically say the Largest Contentful Paint API aims to provide timing information that’s more useful in practice, to the point that it obviates need for the Paint Timing API.

[00:02:21.0639] <sideshowbarker>
In other words, implying (if not explicitly saying) that if you have access to the Largest Contentful Paint timing info, that’s better info and you wouldn’t also have use for knowing when first contentful paint occurred.

[00:05:10.0196] <sideshowbarker>
/me looks around for Noam Rosenthal

[00:11:40.0775] <sideshowbarker>
I have a vague recollection that during discussion with the WebKit team, they may have said that in their implementation, one of these paint-timing metrics wasn’t something that’s very useful in practice for developers to know. Or else, not something that their implementation doesn’t even make measurable such that it could be exposed to web content.

Chrome prioritizes LCP over FCP in Core Web Vitals. This was done based on some analysis and data showing that LCP captured user experience better. Perhaps that is what you're thinking of?

[00:39:35.0470] <Domenic>
Some discussion at the intro to https://web.dev/lcp/, but not much... maybe there's a better source.

[01:19:16.0407] <Noam Rosenthal>
I think FCP are LCP are both useful, in different ways and depending on the content

[01:19:59.0363] <Noam Rosenthal>
they are two important points in the loading experience. LCP is more important for CWV but both can give the developers a good hint about how your loading went

[01:20:31.0687] <Noam Rosenthal>
e.g. if you have a small "Loading" icon and then all the real content loads, FCP will give you the time of the loading icon and LCP will give you the time of the entire content

[01:21:27.0126] <Noam Rosenthal>
for pages like wikipedia, FCP is very important - it's the time where the wikipedia content loads. Afterwards maybe some big image would load and be the LCP, but both timings are meaningful. So like I said it's content-dependent

[01:21:53.0917] <Noam Rosenthal>
CWV is an attempt to crystalize all the different metrics to 3 magic numbers, but many times you need more metrics than that to get the whole story and optimize

[01:22:29.0374] <Noam Rosenthal>

sideshowbarker: the webkit team discussion was about `first-paint`. They didn't want to include it because it was not useful given that webkit buffers painting until it's contentful

> <@zcorpan_:matrix.org> hsivonen: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#the-iframe-element:process-the-iframe-attributes-3

Thanks. I observe that `object` doesn't have a similar _initialInsertion_ flag. Not sure yet, if this is a spec oversight or a genuine platform difference between `object` and `iframe`.

[02:57:02.0031] <sideshowbarker>
Noam Rosenthal: If you have time to look over https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/20346 and call out any problems you see — or any improvements that could be made — that’d be much welcome.

> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Some discussion at the intro to https://web.dev/lcp/, but not much... maybe there's a better source.

I guess what I must have been thinking of was actually just the distinction between first paint and first contentful paint (as Noam mentions)

object spec is a giant mostly-unmaintained mess... if you can make object more like iframe, that would be a great end state

AFAICT, https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/upgrade-insecure-requests/gen/iframe-blank-inherit.meta/upgrade/fetch.https.html tests that calling `document.open()` on the initial `about:blank` inherits `upgrade-insecure-requests` from the caller to the `open()`ed doc. I don't see this specified in either https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-upgrade-insecure-requests/ or https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#document-open-steps . What am I missing? (Also, Gecko tries to inherit CSP between steps 6 and 7, but evidently, it's not inheriting enough.)

[03:49:08.0526] <Domenic>
hsivonen: seems like a bad test. I can't immediately tell given how many layers of generation seem to be going on but I would doubt that was intentionally tested...

[03:50:04.0482] <Domenic>
This code looks totally bogus in Chromium to me... https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/renderer/core/dom/document.cc;l=3257-3285;drc=6bf619d06ef290056d3e134756c1c4eaa17a2d70

[03:50:43.0880] <hsivonen>
The test was OK after all. I tracked it down to Gecko's failure to recompute upgrade-insecure-requests upon `document.open`

[03:51:22.0582] <hsivonen>
(Gecko copied the CSP OK, but failed to actually run the function to compute upgrade-insecure-requests out of the CSP)

[03:51:55.0523] <Domenic>
Fascinating

[03:52:18.0295] <Domenic>
I am hoping we can avoid inheriting anything, whether it's Gecko's CSP or Blink's renderer-process-only sandbox flags / security origin

[03:53:59.0419] <hsivonen>
(Aside: The way `fetch()` spec-wise inherits CSP from the doc in the `window` that `fetch()` is called on, is specified so abstractly that I wasn't confident how upgrade-insecure-requests should propagate, but it turns out that it should propagate from doc to `fetch()`.)

Currently, I'm finding that tests that test history length start failing with my patch but they already fail in Chrome and pretty consistently if I remove expectations for history length to grow by one more than Chrome grows it, the tests pass both in Chrome and in Firefox+my patch.

[04:03:55.0235] <Domenic>

Other places.

[04:11:29.0965] <hsivonen>
Back in 2011 when I tried to change how Gecko handles about:blank, I got failures on history mochitests but didn't have a way to run the same tests in another engine like I can now run WPT to see that the test expectations differ from Chrome and my patch actually moves towards interop despite failing tests.

AFAICT when the inner window is reused when navigating from the initial about:blank, Chrome aborts a synchronous XHR pending in that window and WPT tests this, but I don't see this in the spec. Spec bug or bad spec reading on my part?

hmm wait actually I see the issue is just about the statement _“Setting withCredentials has no effect on same-site requests”_ in MDN at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials.

[01:35:52.0357] <smaug>
plaintext-only is going down nicely. If chromium just pushed a tiny bit, we might be able to get rid of  it

[01:39:55.0103] <zcorpan>
maybe, but 0.2% was enough to need to add `<image>` parsing back in 2006

[01:40:30.0485] <zcorpan>
meanwhile the web editing folks propose a more verbose way to do the same thing (with more control, but still) https://w3c.github.io/editing/docs/contentEditableDisabled/

[01:42:46.0594] <zcorpan>
also -webkit-user-modify: read-write-plaintext-only is at 2%, so if that is not also removed there's no win with removing contenteditable=plaintext-only (which maps to the css property in webkit/chromium)

[01:55:05.0166] <Jake Archibald>
`plaintext-only` is actually pretty nice for creating a text field which grows to fit its contents

Not willing to do that quite yet (it would involve either manually changing every entry in the current database by hand, via a CRUD interface, or bypassing with a hacky search-and-replace like I do to *generate* the mirror). We *are* paying plinss now to get things fixed properly, so we can reevaluate at the end of the contract. ^_^

[16:18:49.0833] <Domenic>
A hacky search-and-replace seems quite worthwhile... maybe I can just do that in the global whatwg build script

> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> A hacky search-and-replace seems quite worthwhile... maybe I can just do that in the global whatwg build script

What this mirror does to avoid linking to drafts.csswg.org is to comb through the bikeshed anchor database and replace those links before building: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/bin/configure-spec-data.py

[03:52:15.0698] <Andreu Botella>
I prefer that over a search and replace on the built specs

[06:22:44.0221] <sideshowbarker>
Andreu Botella: I wonder how practical it would be to have `build-index.py` also build/generate a data file (JSON I guess) with, at least, the last-modified (last-revised) time for each spec?

[06:25:01.0490] <sideshowbarker>
I can do it downstream — by fetching each spec and checking get the revision from the, e.g., `<meta content="929f19ea6d7188d984d2e1c0783dff758d84ec57" name="document-revision">` in each, and then using https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/commits#get-a-commit from the GitHub API to get the commit data and pull out the date.

[06:27:08.0832] <sideshowbarker>
But if you think `build-index.py` could be patched to do basically the same thing upstream, I’d be happy to work on writing up a patch to do that.

[06:28:31.0273] <sideshowbarker>
my main need for it is for https://html-now.github.io/, in the **Repo** column, where the numbers in red and green and black indicate how many days it’s been since the spec was last updated.

[06:30:41.0586] <sideshowbarker>
Right now I get that by doing a HEAD request for each spec and checking the Last-Revised HTTP header — if there is one (which there is for drafts.csswg.org documents); and if there is not, I check the Last-Modified header.

 * I can do it downstream — by fetching each spec and checking the git revision from the, e.g., `<meta content="929f19ea6d7188d984d2e1c0783dff758d84ec57" name="document-revision">` in each, and then using https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/commits#get-a-commit from the GitHub API to get the commit data and pull out the date.

This would be harder to hack into whatwg build scripts since those invoke the csswg API version of Bikeshed. Hmm.

annevk: if you were to create a HTTP header referring to a URL's query/search component, would you use a name containing "query" or "search"? (https://github.com/WICG/nav-speculation/pull/183 for full context if you're interested.)

Jake Archibald:  (I was looking at some of my ancient tests) looks like Chrome has changed session history behavior on this case from the old WebKit model to Presto model: http://mozilla.pettay.fi/moztests/history2/Start.html  I think we don't want to spec either one of those. The testcase is about dynamically added iframes

[06:26:33.0608] <Jake Archibald>
smaug: yeah, I ran across this one too. Firefox's model is the sensible one, and it's what I put in PR.

[06:28:23.0595] <Jake Archibald>
The current spec seems to hint at the Firefox behaviour here too.

[06:32:35.0693] <Jake Archibald>
Ah, ok, this bit isn't handled in the PR. I need to make sure it explicitly removes those history entries when the iframe is removed.

[06:58:39.0517] <Jake Archibald>
Oh, no, I misread, it's handled in the current PR (the Firefox model) https://whatpr.org/html/6315/document-sequences.html#destroy-the-nested-navigable

I am interested in positioning of the <dialog> element when open. I found https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4645 and https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#flow-content-3 and https://browserdefaultstyles.com/#dialog, but it is still not clear to me why is the <dialog> centered. In particular, 1) fixed positioning seems to be recommended, but the default styles are still showing "position:absolute"; 2) there is the "margin:auto" declaration, but this does not seem to center arbitrary elements in my userland code.

[07:14:01.0079] <Domenic>
Did you see the "The dialog element, when its is modal flag is true, is expected to act as if it had a user-agent-level style sheet rule setting the following properties:" sentence? That seems to explain it pretty clearly from my perspective

> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Did you see the "The dialog element, when its is modal flag is true, is expected to act as if it had a user-agent-level style sheet rule setting the following properties:" sentence? That seems to explain it pretty clearly from my perspective

Yes, I did see that! And yet, I do not see any positioning/centering there... max-{width,height} are just dimension limitations; the `position:fixed` implies there will be some left/right/top/bottom positioning specified... and the "inset-block-start" property is new to me, but judging from examples at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset-block-start, the value of 0 would align the box with the top of the page...

[07:23:56.0222] <Ondřej Žára>
Also, some centering is happening with non-modal <dialog>s as well (via the .show() method).

[07:24:59.0720] <Ondřej Žára>
So I assume some styling/centering is going on even without the modal flag set

[09:04:26.0393] <Domenic>
I'd suggest putting all those properties (plus the UA stylesheet base) into a demo with a <div>; I believe it'll cause centering.

[09:04:44.0672] <Domenic>

You are correct, thanks. Let me save the time of other unfortunate devs that come here seeking the answer, trying to re-apply all the mentioned properties: the centering is caused by the `margin:auto`. MDN helpfully suggests "in certain cases this value can be used to center an element".

Hi! I have a question regarding modules imports.
When you dynamically import a module that is already in the modules map, does it yield to the event loop? My reading of the spec is "no", because it schedules a task to continue the import only when it performs an actual fetch, but both Firefox and Chrome seem to yield. They only settle the dynamic import promise in the current promise tasks queue if the import specifier is malformed.

[01:51:19.0464] <Ms2ger 💉💉>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#hostimportmoduledynamically(referencingscriptormodule,-modulerequest,-promisecapability) - the async returning doesn't seem particularly well integrated with the event loop

[01:57:40.0137] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Right, I'm removing it in https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8264 and I'm not 100% sure that I got that part correctly.

[03:45:08.0111] <hsivonen>
What mechanism makes the document.write in https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/browsers/browsing-the-web/navigating-across-documents/010.html not interfere with the load of href.html?

[03:45:15.0000] <hsivonen>
in Chrome that is

[03:46:00.0368] <hsivonen>
In Firefox currently, the mechanism is that the about:blank isn't the initial about:blank anymore, so the navigation does not reuse the inner window, so the `document.write` happens on the old (about:blank) document.

[03:47:15.0162] <hsivonen>
However, when inner window reuse takes place, which it presumably does in Chrome, what makes the `document.write` not blow away the new document that has become the document of the inner window while the event loop for the sync XHR was spinning?

[03:49:21.0618] <hsivonen>
When Chrome aborts the old fetches (including the XHR), does it also manage to abort scripts that are being executed so that the JavaScript program aborts before xhr.send() returns?

[03:49:43.0161] <hsivonen>
I guess I should test that hypothesis.

[03:54:37.0109] <hsivonen>
I can't log with console.log() from within the javascript: URL in Chrome. Is Chrome not executing the javascript: URL at all for some reason?

[09:55:03.0529] <Domenic>
nicolo-ribaudo: I guess we should match browsers here, and queue a task regardless. Even if IMO it would have been more elegant not to yield, this is what I get for using imprecise spec constructs; implementers used what they are familiar with / what is well specced (task yielding) and now we end up here.

[09:55:53.0282] <Domenic>
Web platform tests for this would be ideal if possible :)

[09:59:56.0413] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Yeah I agree that not yielding would be more elegant... I'll try to check how the other browsers behave; if they all agree or if there is inconsistent behaviour.

AFAICT Chrome doesn't execute the javascript: URL at all on https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blame/master/html/browsers/browsing-the-web/navigating-across-documents/010.html . Safari, however, is really strange: onmessage sees document.write() winning over the href navigation but what the user sees is the href navigation--not the document.write.

[12:22:39.0908] <hsivonen>
Currently my local patch for Gecko has document.write winning both for script and rendering purposes.

[12:22:51.0559] <hsivonen>
Under what theory should document.write() not win?

[12:24:39.0658] <hsivonen>
That is, what's the logic that the test is trying to test? That aborting the javascript: URL navigation should abort the script excecution and not just the pseudo-network response resulting from the returned string?

This test seems to expect _non-initial_ about:blank (which in Chrome fires its load event async) to have the magic characteristic of the DOM getting built (i.e. `contentDocument.body` existing) synchronously when the location has updated: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/ab53b6abd671656733e41ef03cd0be11250688d7/content-security-policy/inheritance/history-iframe.sub.html#L53-L63 Is there a legitimate Web compat need for this magic?

Not off the top of my head, sorry!

[15:05:17.0240] <Dominic Farolino>
Kiiiinnda looks like they just always do? https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#creating-a-css-module-script

[15:06:45.0046] <TabAtkins>
it always creates a stylesheet object, but the ES algo it passes that to only uses that value if you haven't already done a css import from that url. If you have it just grabs the existing value.

[15:07:52.0861] <TabAtkins>
But it remains that all of this work is observable (such as via a proxy on the CSSStyleSheet prototype, I think), whereas JS module creation is *not* observable, so the model used by JS isn't great here.

[15:08:02.0491] <TabAtkins>
It should accept some default steps, rather than just a default object.

just a very smol question from an indie "coder" - someone knows either a full source code or css file of **X H T M L** ? cant find in google and wanted to make something similar...

[11:02:47.0323] <hacknorris>
im just curious how xhtml displays media mostly

[11:02:59.0212] <hacknorris>
rest i figured out by myself already

[11:03:16.0239] <Andreu Botella>
the only real difference is the parsing, everything else stays the same

[11:03:33.0105] <hacknorris>
and i mean - i have mine dtd already

[11:03:53.0045] <Andreu Botella>
well, if you're not careful with namespaces, you might end up with elements that look like HTML but aren't, and that would end up with a difference in rendering

[11:04:02.0413] <hacknorris>
is it executing wasm or js do display ? or whut ?

> <@abotella:igalia.com> well, if you're not careful with namespaces, you might end up with elements that look like HTML but aren't, and that would end up with a difference in rendering

no, i made a general tag for media and now i think what i can achieve with css lol

> <@abotella:igalia.com> ?

like an image. pixel-by-pixel

[11:05:07.0216] <hacknorris>
looks like wasm

[11:05:23.0528] <hacknorris>
eventually JS

[11:05:36.0771] <Andreu Botella>
XHTML renders the same as HTML, the only difference is the source is parsed in a different way.

[11:05:45.0707] <hacknorris>
and i mean source

[11:05:58.0950] <hacknorris>
i do xml html the reversed way

[11:06:07.0891] <Andreu Botella>
But if you're not careful with namespaces, you might end up with something like `<p>` that isn't really an HTML `<p>` element and doesn't have the default `display: block`

[11:06:10.0911] <hacknorris>
like i make xml file displaying in browser

[11:06:23.0159] <hacknorris>
> <@abotella:igalia.com> But if you're not careful with namespaces, you might end up with something like `<p>` that isn't really an HTML `<p>` element and doesn't have the default `display: block`

this i figured

[11:06:35.0058] <hacknorris>
and i meant - make **alternative** to <img> tag

[11:06:43.0161] <hacknorris>
 * and i meant - make **alternative** to <img> tag

[11:07:03.0104] <Andreu Botella>
something like that you'd have to do with CSS

[11:07:16.0312] <hacknorris>
but in css there is no display image afaik

[11:08:06.0859] <Andreu Botella>
```css
my-namespace|my-image-tag::before {
  content: image("./image.png");
}
```

[11:08:18.0018] <hacknorris>
content supports images ?!

[11:08:20.0377] <hacknorris>
wtf ?!

[11:09:05.0278] <hacknorris>
i thought maximum i can achieve was to display thing from data-x="something" instead of title attrib

[11:09:44.0505] <hacknorris>
> <@abotella:igalia.com> ```css

If you want to control how *other* elements are displayed, you're limited to what CSS can do. The *specifics* of all that are in the browser code. Most browsers are open-sourse, so in theory you can read their code, but they're some of the biggest, most complicated programs in the world, so that's probably not very helpful. ^_^

[17:01:04.0249] <TabAtkins>
If you just want to know what CSS the browsers use to display the existing elements by default, search for "user agent style sheet" - the browsers use their own CSS file for this, and there are several blog articles examining them.

is it supposed to fill some semantic role? Because I'm pretty sure if you're writing vertical text (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, Mongolian with CSS `writing-mode: vertical-rl`) you can use `<hr>` and it will render vertical by default

It's possible that the key thing is the time when `window.location` updates: start of parse vs. end of parse.

I found another Chromium-originating WPT that assumes that on non-initial about:blank, `location.href == "about:blank"` implies that the `about:blank` DOM has been built. Still no idea if this is a thing test authors assume or a thing that Web authors also assume.

> <@hsivonen:mozilla.org> https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/content-security-policy/inheritance/window-open-local-after-network-scheme.sub.html

The spec sure reads to me like the URL of the `Location` object should update when a new `Document` is created by the parse as opposed to being deferred to the end of the parse: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-location-url

[01:42:17.0732] <hsivonen>
Hmm. Chromium seems to force synchronous HTML parsing for `javascript:` URLs. Is there a justification for that? (Gecko doesn't do that.)

[01:49:56.0394] <hsivonen>
I suspect Chromium's implementation of how about:blank URLs result in a (zero-length) stream of data might have the side effect of the HTML tokenizer getting pumped to EOF in the same task that creates the `Document` object. Is that the case, Yoav Weiss ?

[01:51:40.0917] <hsivonen>
My current patch removes the remains of the Netscape-era HTML parser that we were using for `about:blank` only, but it looks a lot like I might have to re-introduce an `about:blank`-specific parser or parse mode for non-initial `about:blank` if Web sites assume what Chromium-originating WPTs assume. :-(

[01:55:35.0194] <hsivonen>
Are extensions in Chromium allowed to cause an asynchronicity point in HTML tree building of a from-stream-parsed document? That is, do the WPT assumption of non-initial `about:blank` element nodes getting created in the same task as the document hold if Chromium instances that have arbitrary extensions installed?

[02:02:41.0194] <hsivonen>
I guess I'm going to implement a special `about:blank` mode for the main HTML parser in Gecko and see what happens with WPTs. I think this is sad.

So WebDriver-BiDi wants to inject some scripts that run before any other script on the page (maybe before any DOM is constructed? That would be more deterministic, but maybe unnecessary if it's hard). I'm not sure quite where the right place to execute those scripts is in terms of the HTML spec. Can I do it right after the environment settings object for the new Window is created (i.e. after 6.9 in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#initialise-the-document-object) or should I be looking elsewhere?

[06:47:49.0064] <hsivonen>
It looks like the spec, Blink, and WebKit think that `window.stop()` should prevent `DOMContentLoaded` from firing. Gecko fires it. I can find only on WPT that tests this and that expect the Gecko behavior. Am I missing something or have I found a basic interop issue that has remarkably little spec-based WPT coverage?

[07:41:22.0918] <annevk>
hsivonen: it would not surprise me if that was from the Hixie era

[07:43:24.0903] <annevk>
It does look somewhat nicely factored, so it might have gotten updated without all corner cases being tested (and in particular how it interacts with the parser might well have been overlooked)

As far as I understand, an `error` event isn’t cancelable unless it’s initialized/fired with its `cancelable` attribute explicitly set to true.

About the `error` event, see the change in that PR, in particular this part:
https://pr21001.content.dev.mdn.mozit.cloud/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/error_event#usage_notes
> Unlike other events, the `error` event is canceled by returning `true` from the handler instead of returning `false`. When canceled, the error won't appear in the console, but the current script will still stop executing.

Is that behavior defined in the spec somewhere? And is that different from the event being “cancelable”?

[22:28:45.0716] <sideshowbarker>
ah, in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#runtime-script-errors I guess

I'm assuming that non-initial about:blank being interoperably unlike http URLs in its DOM construction means that it's too risky to make it behave like http URLs in relation to the event loop.

Btw. Today already someone knows answer to this my yesterday question about css?

For the first time in five years or so the SG repository has no outstanding PRs! (Not a challenge.)

What is the purpose of the x-user-defined encoding? I'm curious if it's in the spec only because it used to be used as a way to download binary files ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6986789/why-are-some-bytes-prefixed-with-0xf7-when-using-charset-x-user-defined-with-xm ) ( https://web.archive.org/web/20070612091315/http://mgran.blogspot.com/ ).

"Return a code point whose value is 0xF780 + byte − 0x80.".... is there a reason it doesn't just say 0xF700 + byte?

[08:24:34.0589] <annevk>
Sgeo: the idea is to make it clear the code point will start at 0xF780 as byte will be at least 0x80

About the `SpeechRecognition` (`webkitSpeechRecognition`) part of the Web Speech API: As far as I can tell, there’s no way to programatically determine what languages the browser recognizes/supports for speech input/recognition?

In comparison, for the TTS part of the API, I know I can do `window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()` to get an array of the supported voices/languages — but there’s no similar method or property for `SpeechRecognition`.

But I wonder if there might be some browser-specific ways to get the supported languages back from Chrome and Safari.

[22:39:52.0446] <sideshowbarker>
I’m also wondering exactly how the speech recognition part of the API works in Chrome and Safari. I’ve gleaned that in Chrome it seems to rely on the browser calling out to some remote Google speech-recognition service. But in the Safari case it seems to be using some built-in macOS speech-recognition platform feature. But… what exactly?

And does Edge rely on the same remote Google speech-recognition service that Chrome does?

[22:40:36.0465] <sideshowbarker>
Asking in the context of trying to provide some better documentation in MDN about how `SpeechRecognition` actually works.

For a while "good first issue" yielded mostly good results, but now it just seems like an endless stream of requests for getting assigned to an issue. Maybe we should go back to a different label (e.g., "beginner") and just outline some instructions for beginners in the README (or through a pointer from there)?

[01:05:36.0903] <annevk>
I suppose we could try to outline some clearer instructions first, but I've the feeling the label contributes due to dedicated GitHub support.

Help/comments welcome at https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/20730

The OP asserts _“`preventDefault()` doesn't work in Chrome”_ and objects to MDN marking the `returnValue` property of `Event` as deprecated “despite it being the only working feature across all browsers”.

Seems just... wrong? Ask them to provide proof.

Yeah I guess I should do that, but I'm reluctant to engage with the OP at all, since this seems like a type where there's no possible resolution for their issue that they're going to end up being satisfied with

[04:09:13.0207] <Domenic>
Yeah that's fair

[04:09:26.0254] <Domenic>
I mean there's a slight chance they'll test it, realize they're wrong, and be graceful about it.

Oh Element (Matrix?) both has a "reply" and a "reply in thread (beta)" feature. Why aren't these one feature.
