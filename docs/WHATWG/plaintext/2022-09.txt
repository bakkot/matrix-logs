Hello

[01:01:57.0914] <sideshowbarker>
`Transfer-Encoding` seems to be the only HTTP fields/header that’s not defined in the core HTTP Semantics spec, https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html, but instead in the HTTP/1.1 Syntax spec, https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html#field.transfer-encoding

Does anybody know why that is?

Why couldn’t it instead be specified in the Semantics spec along with all the other fields/headers?

hmm, I guess maybe because it’s not supported in HTTP/2 (and likely not in HTTP/3) — and so in that sense, it’s not part of the shared Semantics of core HTTP but instead it’s something that only works in the HTTP/1.1 syntax…

annevk: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1469 is highest-priority fetch PR if you could find some time soon :)

It looks like our next HTML triage meeting conflicts with TPAC. I'm thinking of skipping this instance, unless others disagree.

Domenic Do you mind if I start working on https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7996? It took me a while to understand how "wait until it asynchronously complete" and "custom perform the fetch steps" work, and I would be happy to help replacing them with more explicit constructs.

Has anyone else noticed that HTML's section on "killing scripts" only focuses on killing script or module evaluation, rather than the evaluation of a callback?
