In https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#steps-to-expose-a-media-resource-specific-text-track, under MPEG-4, there are a couple occurrences of roughly "the concatenation of A, B, and C, or D if condition". It's unclear what the 'scope' of the "or" is. Is it (A+B+C) or (D)? Or is it A+B+(C or D)?

I looked for how browsers implemented that paragraph, but haven't yet found one that does.

Looks like Hixie added it in 2012 (d485159e) and it hasn't been touched much since then.

I have an open PR that I need to get back to to clean up that algorithm a bit, but I don't touch that part

Testing would be good to verify, but I'm 95% certain that "or" is tightly bound, so it's just "C or D". The C is always "the first FOO field" and the D condition is"if there is no FOO field", so it's extremely likely that the D (always an empty string) is providing a default for the missing C case.

Testing implementations? You'd first have to find one that implements that chunk of the spec, and I'm doubtful there is one. (I don't think anything in WPT calls inBandMetadataTrackDispatchType, so you can't find implementations that way.) And then you'd need to find or create an MPEG-4 file that triggered the condition in question.

The A+B+(C or D) interpretation is 'better' in that it distinguishes more cases. But it seems odd to me that a dispatch type could have a trailing space.
