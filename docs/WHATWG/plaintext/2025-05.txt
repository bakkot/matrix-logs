Domenic: https://github.com/speced/bikeshed/issues/2270 might be of interest

[00:05:25.0276] <Domenic>
Yeah, I saw that. No strong opinion.

[00:42:10.0978] <annevk>
freddy: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/243#issuecomment-2844102645 seems concerning, if strict-dynamic is still considered the best policy

[01:22:52.0101] <evilpie>
strict-dynamic is definitely far from the best policy. Maybe the easiest for some to get started.

[07:20:59.0157] <freddy>
Dunno if "best", it might just be that the success from Goog is specific to their org's shape rather than universally great ü§∑

[09:13:37.0477] <annevk>
freddy: I guess I'm trying to determine if we ended up in a situation where one part of Google cares about a particular shape of CSP and another part cares about module scripts, but never the two shall meet.

Who is the channel op of irc #whatwg on libera.chat? Can we set a topic and ask people to come here instead? Is it customary/proper to readonly the irc channel too?

[19:27:13.0938] <ljharb>
nobody is, it‚Äôs unowned and can‚Äôt get an op unless everyone leaves

[03:42:23.0402] <acr>
they can transfer the ownership in libera.chat

[03:42:33.0334] <acr>
at least they say so in their site

[03:42:40.0691] <acr>
* at least they say so in their site ljharb 

[03:43:27.0444] <acr>
as long as a representative of whatwg claims it, they should put the rep of whatwg as moderator

[03:57:31.0769] <acr>
* at least that seems from  https://libera.chat/chanreg/ [@ljharb:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@ljharb:matrix.org) ?

[04:13:09.0528] <acr>
this is what one of libera's mods said: "if the channel is opless we can op someone in the channel if everyone therein agrees, alternatively a project can claim a channel, which is another process."

[04:13:22.0352] <acr>
* this is what one of libera's mods said: "*if the channel is opless we can op someone in the channel if everyone therein agrees, alternatively a project can claim a channel, which is another process.*"

[04:39:18.0042] <Domenic>
I don't believe anyone here has ever heard of that IRC channel, so I don't think anyone's going to step up to help with it.

annevk: Does Tracking Prevention impact the `ping` attribute in webkit?

[04:50:28.0558] <annevk>
I don't think so. Also not immediately clear that it should as it doesn't disable JavaScript either.

[05:11:27.0835] <zcorpan>
annevk: context: https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1212#issuecomment-2834180558

[05:16:05.0658] <zcorpan>
Hmmm, the ping destination doesn't have a means to store cookies or so, so cross-site tracking with `ping` is not possible, right?

[05:25:04.0217] <zcorpan>
https://webkit.org/blog/8821/link-click-analytics-and-privacy/ "So our approach is to have ITP block cookies and downgrade the referrer header (see the section on Origin-Only Referrer in our ITP 2.0 blog post) for all the link click analytics techniques listed when the request goes to a third-party domain classified with cross-site tracking capabilities."

[05:27:13.0954] <annevk>
zcorpan: it doesn't have more capabilities than any other kind of fetch, right

[13:51:59.0907] <jarhar>
annevk: anything i can do to help with the customizable select PRs?

Chrome seems to be the only browser which shares user activation across iframes. Is this worthy of filing an issue to discuss or is this well known? /cc smaug 

[03:11:40.0089] <keithamus>
* Chrome seems to be the only browser which shares user activation across iframes. Is this worthy of filing an issue to discuss or is this well known? /cc smaug

Test case:

`data:text/html,<!DOCTYPE html><iframe src="https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/active-check/"></iframe><iframe src="https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/active-check/"></iframe>`

Click one of the buttons, in Chrome both will switch to `isActive: true` - others won't.

[03:15:20.0662] <smaug>
keithamus: so that case about sibling iframes

[03:15:39.0775] <smaug>
* keithamus: so that case about sibling iframes, right?

[03:15:53.0779] <keithamus>
yes exactly.

[03:16:44.0441] <smaug>
Per spec user activation should propagate to ancestors and descendants, I think https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#activation-notification

[03:16:49.0535] <smaug>
and that seems to be what Gecko does

[03:16:56.0521] <smaug>
(if I read the code correctly)

[03:18:40.0191] <smaug>
so is this just a bug in Chrome?

[03:19:24.0450] <keithamus>
https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/active-check/same-origin.html yes it seems same origin descendants works fine across all

[03:19:32.0424] <keithamus>
So yeah this is perhaps a chrome bug.

[03:24:28.0958] <keithamus>
https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9831 looks like canadahonk already reported this one üòÖ. It's tracked in https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41449756 but seems like some ad tech depends on it?

[05:08:18.0306] <smaug>
or that ad tech would prefer the spec behavior?

[07:50:51.0804] <jarhar>
i recommend commenting on that chrome bug to get mustaq's attention

[19:19:26.0612] <Domenic>
I would appreciate if someone would double-check my reading of the rules for choosing a navigable in https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11291 . It is surprising that this basic thing was missed for some time.

[19:56:54.0435] <akaster>
in firefox on linux both the links and the buttons each open new tabs

[19:57:14.0611] <akaster>
* in firefox on linux both the links and the buttons all open new tabs

[19:57:43.0026] <akaster>
ah that's what the issue says

I kind of vaguely remember something about the _‚Äúnon-empty target names, other than _top, _self, and _parent, are treated like _blank in terms of deciding whether to open a new browsing context‚Äù_ text cited from that MDN page

[20:01:42.0999] <sideshowbarker>
* I kind of vaguely remember something about the *‚Äúnon-empty target names, other than \_top, \_self, and \_parent, are treated like _blank in terms of deciding whether to open a new browsing context‚Äù* text cited from that MDN page

[20:07:14.0813] <sideshowbarker>
after checking now, I can see it‚Äôs been in there for more than 4 years ‚Äî ever since the wiki days <https://github.com/mdn/content/blame/7a4949c39200965c35633b89ea0d7b5016a381e6/files/en-us/web/api/window/open/index.html>

[20:08:36.0295] <sideshowbarker>
So‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know who might have added it to MDN originally, or when ‚Äî but I guess they may just have discovered it from testing

[20:11:04.0369] <sideshowbarker>
For MDN, we still regularly get PRs that are cases of contributors saying, _‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find where any spec says this is what‚Äôs supposed to happen, but some testing shows that this is what browsers are doing‚Äù_ for some particular thing

[22:07:12.0659] <annevk>
Domenic: I suspect we even test that, but forgot about it when we did the recent tightening of conditions there?

[22:07:55.0076] <Domenic>
Hmm yeah, maybe I am just fooled by how clear the spec looks now

[22:14:13.0146] <Domenic>
https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/browsers/windows/auxiliary-browsing-contexts/named-lookup-scoped-to-browsing-context-group.html is kind of a test but not comprehensive.

[22:18:25.0382] <annevk>
jarhar: is there now a plan for landing all of the PRs? Is the parser change solid? (I think the nested button needs a bit more work still.)

[22:21:07.0760] <annevk>
jarhar: is https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10548 up-to-date? It didn't have a working PR Preview until I fiddled with it just now... When I look at https://whatpr.org/html/10548/2e87c0f...e556826/dom.html#select-element-inner-content-elements the option element inner content elements appears inconsistent. It doesn't have the nested list.

[22:22:40.0578] <annevk>
jarhar: if it indeed all fits in a single PR and we get working PR Preview that might be the best? Then we can all look through the generated diffs, address the final nits, and call it a day.

[10:07:54.0772] <jarhar>
could you elaborate on what should change about the nested button? are you talking about putting <button> inside <select>?

[10:10:33.0845] <jarhar>
i just pushed an update to the "complete" pr, it is up to date now

[10:11:06.0741] <jarhar>
ok yeah i could make two lists, one for included content and one for excluded content. does that sound good?

[10:17:05.0520] <jarhar>
i pushed a change to do this to the content model pr and updated the "complete" pr to include it too

Does the UA stylesheet need updating regarding calc-size or is the bug I found a chromium issue rather than a spec issue?

[11:56:19.0337] <Zephiris>
Hi, I found [this suggestion](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1390#issuecomment-879547617) for allowing sandboxed iframes (without allow-same-origin) to have an assigned service worker through adding an srcworker attribute to the iframe:
`<iframe sandbox srcworker="./service.js" />`
I and a few others in the thread linked above have expressed support for this feature but I am unable to find an issue in whatwg for this feature. I've simultaneously been looking for a good excuse to start contributing to web browsers and this seems like as good an opportunity as any to do so. 

I recognize that this would be an addition to the specification and so I would need support from at least two implementers. How can I go about getting that support? Should I open up feature requests/PRs on the browser engines? Should I first make a feature request on whatwg/html and then get support from implementers? Thanks!

[12:13:05.0293] <zphrs>
Never mind, I found https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/290. I'll just follow this

If you have tests impacted by partitioned BroadcastChannel, what would be the best replacement at this point in time? The stash feature? Is there a client-side wrapper for that available today?

[01:50:08.0081] <Noam Rosenthal>
`stash` was more about retaining shared state than message-passing, no?

[02:00:17.0809] <zcorpan>
annevk: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/common/dispatcher#sendreceive-message-passing-apis

[02:02:39.0959] <zcorpan>
or maybe there's a replacement for those? https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/90

[02:04:31.0022] <zcorpan>
or https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/98
