freddy: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/243#issuecomment-2844102645 seems concerning, if strict-dynamic is still considered the best policy

[01:22:52.0101] <evilpie>
strict-dynamic is definitely far from the best policy. Maybe the easiest for some to get started.

[07:20:59.0157] <freddy>
Dunno if "best", it might just be that the success from Goog is specific to their org's shape rather than universally great ü§∑

[09:13:37.0477] <annevk>
freddy: I guess I'm trying to determine if we ended up in a situation where one part of Google cares about a particular shape of CSP and another part cares about module scripts, but never the two shall meet.

Who is the channel op of irc #whatwg on libera.chat? Can we set a topic and ask people to come here instead? Is it customary/proper to readonly the irc channel too?

[19:27:13.0938] <ljharb>
nobody is, it‚Äôs unowned and can‚Äôt get an op unless everyone leaves

[03:42:23.0402] <acr>
they can transfer the ownership in libera.chat

at least they say so in their site

[03:42:40.0691] <acr>
* at least they say so in their site ljharb 

[03:43:27.0444] <acr>
as long as a representative of whatwg claims it, they should put the rep of whatwg as moderator

[03:57:31.0769] <acr>
* at least that seems from  https://libera.chat/chanreg/ [@ljharb:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@ljharb:matrix.org) ?

[04:13:09.0528] <acr>
this is what one of libera's mods said: "if the channel is opless we can op someone in the channel if everyone therein agrees, alternatively a project can claim a channel, which is another process."

annevk: Does Tracking Prevention impact the `ping` attribute in webkit?

[04:50:28.0558] <annevk>
I don't think so. Also not immediately clear that it should as it doesn't disable JavaScript either.

[05:11:27.0835] <zcorpan>
annevk: context: https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1212#issuecomment-2834180558

[05:16:05.0658] <zcorpan>
Hmmm, the ping destination doesn't have a means to store cookies or so, so cross-site tracking with `ping` is not possible, right?

[05:25:04.0217] <zcorpan>
https://webkit.org/blog/8821/link-click-analytics-and-privacy/ "So our approach is to have ITP block cookies and downgrade the referrer header (see the section on Origin-Only Referrer in our ITP 2.0 blog post) for all the link click analytics techniques listed when the request goes to a third-party domain classified with cross-site tracking capabilities."

Chrome seems to be the only browser which shares user activation across iframes. Is this worthy of filing an issue to discuss or is this well known? /cc smaug 

[03:11:40.0089] <keithamus>
* Chrome seems to be the only browser which shares user activation across iframes. Is this worthy of filing an issue to discuss or is this well known? /cc smaug

Test case:

`data:text/html,<!DOCTYPE html><iframe src="https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/active-check/"></iframe><iframe src="https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/active-check/"></iframe>`

Click one of the buttons, in Chrome both will switch to `isActive: true` - others won't.

[03:15:20.0662] <smaug>
keithamus: so that case about sibling iframes

[03:15:39.0775] <smaug>

[03:15:53.0779] <keithamus>
yes exactly.

[03:16:44.0441] <smaug>
Per spec user activation should propagate to ancestors and descendants, I think https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#activation-notification

[03:16:49.0535] <smaug>
and that seems to be what Gecko does

[03:16:56.0521] <smaug>
(if I read the code correctly)

[03:18:40.0191] <smaug>
so is this just a bug in Chrome?

[03:19:24.0450] <keithamus>
https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/active-check/same-origin.html yes it seems same origin descendants works fine across all

[03:19:32.0424] <keithamus>
So yeah this is perhaps a chrome bug.

[03:24:28.0958] <keithamus>
https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9831 looks like canadahonk already reported this one üòÖ. It's tracked in https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41449756 but seems like some ad tech depends on it?

[20:07:14.0813] <sideshowbarker>
after checking now, I can see it‚Äôs been in there for more than 4 years ‚Äî ever since the wiki days <https://github.com/mdn/content/blame/7a4949c39200965c35633b89ea0d7b5016a381e6/files/en-us/web/api/window/open/index.html>

[20:08:36.0295] <sideshowbarker>
So‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know who might have added it to MDN originally, or when ‚Äî but I guess they may just have discovered it from testing

[20:11:04.0369] <sideshowbarker>
For MDN, we still regularly get PRs that are cases of contributors saying, _‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find where any spec says this is what‚Äôs supposed to happen, but some testing shows that this is what browsers are doing‚Äù_ for some particular thing

[22:07:12.0659] <annevk>
Domenic: I suspect we even test that, but forgot about it when we did the recent tightening of conditions there?

[22:07:55.0076] <Domenic>

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/browsers/windows/auxiliary-browsing-contexts/named-lookup-scoped-to-browsing-context-group.html is kind of a test but not comprehensive.

jarhar: is there now a plan for landing all of the PRs? Is the parser change solid? (I think the nested button needs a bit more work still.)

jarhar: is https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10548 up-to-date? It didn't have a working PR Preview until I fiddled with it just now... When I look at https://whatpr.org/html/10548/2e87c0f...e556826/dom.html#select-element-inner-content-elements the option element inner content elements appears inconsistent. It doesn't have the nested list.

[22:22:40.0578] <annevk>
jarhar: if it indeed all fits in a single PR and we get working PR Preview that might be the best? Then we can all look through the generated diffs, address the final nits, and call it a day.

[10:07:54.0772] <jarhar>
could you elaborate on what should change about the nested button? are you talking about putting <button> inside <select>?

i just pushed an update to the "complete" pr, it is up to date now

Does the UA stylesheet need updating regarding calc-size or is the bug I found a chromium issue rather than a spec issue?

[11:56:19.0337] <Zephiris>
Hi, I found [this suggestion](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1390#issuecomment-879547617) for allowing sandboxed iframes (without allow-same-origin) to have an assigned service worker through adding an srcworker attribute to the iframe:
`<iframe sandbox srcworker="./service.js" />`
I and a few others in the thread linked above have expressed support for this feature but I am unable to find an issue in whatwg for this feature. I've simultaneously been looking for a good excuse to start contributing to web browsers and this seems like as good an opportunity as any to do so. 

I recognize that this would be an addition to the specification and so I would need support from at least two implementers. How can I go about getting that support? Should I open up feature requests/PRs on the browser engines? Should I first make a feature request on whatwg/html and then get support from implementers? Thanks!

[12:13:05.0293] <zphrs>
Never mind, I found https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/290. I'll just follow this

[02:20:30.0728] <annevk>
zcorpan: thanks, that's very helpful. I'm surprised the cross-origin-opener-policy tests haven't yet been rewritten to make use of those, but I suppose I can take a look at that.

```
data:text/html,<!DOCTYPE%20html><script>document.addEventListener('keypress',console.log);</script>

Chrome & Firefox don't fire a `keypress` event for the `Escape` key. WebKit seems to. I'm curious if there's a spec detail that represents this, or if this is something known?

[02:27:15.0096] <zcorpan>
keithamus: WebKit doesn't fire it when in fullscreen https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/13781

[02:28:14.0352] <zcorpan>
Also see https://github.com/whatwg/fullscreen/issues/231

[02:28:48.0686] <keithamus>
https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#event-type-keypress seems to suggest it shouldn't fire because it doesn't produce a printable character:

> only if that key normally produces a character value

[02:31:50.0693] <zcorpan>

[18:36:09.0877] <Domenic>
RemoteContext is a wrapper around dispatcher. RemoteContextHelper is a wrapper around RemoteContext. Each level up makes the resulting tests look nicer and nicer but also, of course, less flexible.

[18:36:39.0677] <Domenic>
I have never seen the channels before...

[00:23:43.0411] <zcorpan>
Domenic: Should we reopen https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1605 ? `<link rel=stylesheet>` is allowed in body. IDK if that happened after this issue was closed, but the restyling argument applies for `link`. You could also use a data: URL to inline the stylesheet with `link`

[00:24:55.0220] <Domenic>
https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1605#issuecomment-235956455 discusses why, in 2016, I believed style was different than link...

[05:47:46.0909] <snek>
has anyone ever proposed a protocol to autocomplete urls? like if you type `docs.rs/...` it will talk to docs.rs somehow to complete the package name. I'm sure this is too niche to ever become a real thing but I'm curious for prior art at least.

[12:17:29.0191] <smaug>
Domenic: How are CloseWatchers supposed to work if there are multiple of them active in different iframes and one presses "back arrow" on Android, as an example. Desktop is perhaps easier if it relies on focus, but that arrow thingie on Android, not so sure.

Firefox supports this


2025-05-15
[23:08:09.0207] <Domenic>

[08:22:34.0496] <akaster>
Is it expected to be confused by the `shared worker manager` steps in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#dom-sharedworker ?

We start execution in the Agent corresponding to `outside settings`. Then we're expected to iterate over a list of SharedWorkerGlobalScope objects, which might exist in different agents or agent clusters from the one we're in. I can understand that this should be some abstract 'ask the user agent global data about this' operation. Then in step 11.5 we're supposed to, in the realm/agent of the caller of the SharedWorker constructor, create a message port to entangle with the existing shared worker object. But like mentioned above, the shared worker global scope might not even exist in the same agent or agent cluster. So we're supposed to hand-wave some IPC to connect a new owner and IPC message port connection?

The run a worker steps at least take the time to `obtaining a dedicated/shared worker agent` and be explicit about who is calling what from where üòÖ

[09:46:28.0093] <annevk>
akaster: there might be an issue around refactoring that better. It should prolly use parallel queue to ensure everyone is looking at the same user agent managed list of shared workers.

[09:47:25.0008] <annevk>
akaster: I think I looked at doing that when we integrated with agent clusters, but there was something hairy about it.

[10:23:43.0133] <akaster>
It does mention that there's a parallel queue, but I don't know if I understand the implications of that related to cross-agent synchronization 

[11:02:42.0300] <annevk>
akaster: mainly that each algorithm run on it is done sequentially, but the order in which the algorithms are queued is a race I think. But the current setup is very confused as it just grabs random globals while being in parallel. That's a no-no.

[11:04:16.0682] <akaster>
Gotcha. I did think that that part was the most confusing. I suppose the automated checks dontcallmedom was running that look for that sort of thing "in parallel" don't catch when things are hidden behind a named parallel queue

[11:04:54.0509] <akaster>
* Gotcha. I did think that that the part where the algorithm grabs at several different  globals at a time was the most confusing. I suppose the automated checks dontcallmedom was running that look for that sort of thing "in parallel" don't catch when things are hidden behind a named parallel queue

[11:06:22.0563] <annevk>
I actually can't find a canonical issue that tracks how broken this is.

[11:07:37.0617] <annevk>
Want to file an issue? This kind of thing is definitely worth fixing, though getting it prioritized might be tricky. But perhaps we can impose it on the next person doing something non-trivial with workers.

[13:36:34.0487] <akaster>
Sure, I'll write it up

[16:56:54.0203] <akaster>

[21:22:40.0279] <Domenic>
This just seems like a special case of what I covered in https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/pull/1755#issuecomment-2661941708 , about how we often treat some objects as both their JS/IDL instantiations, and as their browser-process instantiations. It's especially bad for globals like Window, Document, WorkerGlobalScope.

[03:21:42.0585] <annevk>
Yeah I guess the question is if we can make a meaningful improvement here that improves clarity while at the same time not have to maintain all kinds of user-agent remote objects. Perhaps we can have some special kind of indication for what objects can be accessed across the boundary and we could maybe even indicate what state can be accessed in this way.

[07:03:02.0431] <akaster>
it definitely has echoes of that issue.

[09:08:10.0286] <akaster>
is every WorkerGlobalScope's embedder policy always supposed to have the default values for every field? I can't find anywhere in the cross references for https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#concept-workerglobalscope-embedder-policy that actually initializes it to anything.

[09:12:55.0320] <akaster>
is there supposed to be some stronger relationship between a worker global scope's policy container and its embedder policy or something?

[09:14:10.0975] <akaster>
oh I think I see. the references to WorkerGlobalScope's embedder policy should instead refer to its policy container's embedder policy

[09:14:29.0023] <akaster>

nicolo-ribaudo: Hi, I'd like to ask a question regarding to the fetch descendants of a module script, https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-the-descendants-of-and-link-a-module-script, in step 7, "Upon rejection of loadPromise, ...", the spec only handles the [[ParseError]] to the 'error to rethrow', what about other Errors thrown during HostLoadImportedModule, https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#hostloadimportedmodule, for example resolutionError, TypeError 

[13:33:36.0441] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'll reply in the next few days, I need to re-read the spec I wrote because it has been a while

[13:39:34.0003] <@allstarschh>
in step 7.2 of the fetch descendants, "run onComplete given null", then to the 'execute the script element", step 4, if el's result is null, fire onerror 

[13:41:08.0160] <@allstarschh>
and the wpt is https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/semantics/scripting-1/the-script-element/import-attributes/invalid-type-attribute-error.html

[13:42:07.0808] <@allstarschh>
the wpt expects window.onerror, not  script's onerror, so I am confused
