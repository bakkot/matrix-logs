Domenic: https://github.com/speced/bikeshed/issues/2270 might be of interest

[00:05:25.0276] <Domenic>
Yeah, I saw that. No strong opinion.

[00:42:10.0978] <annevk>
freddy: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/243#issuecomment-2844102645 seems concerning, if strict-dynamic is still considered the best policy

[01:22:52.0101] <evilpie>
strict-dynamic is definitely far from the best policy. Maybe the easiest for some to get started.

[07:20:59.0157] <freddy>
Dunno if "best", it might just be that the success from Goog is specific to their org's shape rather than universally great ðŸ¤·

[09:13:37.0477] <annevk>
freddy: I guess I'm trying to determine if we ended up in a situation where one part of Google cares about a particular shape of CSP and another part cares about module scripts, but never the two shall meet.

Who is the channel op of irc #whatwg on libera.chat? Can we set a topic and ask people to come here instead? Is it customary/proper to readonly the irc channel too?

[19:27:13.0938] <ljharb>
nobody is, itâ€™s unowned and canâ€™t get an op unless everyone leaves

[03:42:23.0402] <acr>
they can transfer the ownership in libera.chat

[03:42:33.0334] <acr>
at least they say so in their site

[03:42:40.0691] <acr>
* at least they say so in their site ljharb 

[03:43:27.0444] <acr>
as long as a representative of whatwg claims it, they should put the rep of whatwg as moderator

[03:57:31.0769] <acr>
* at least that seems from  https://libera.chat/chanreg/ [@ljharb:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@ljharb:matrix.org) ?

[04:13:09.0528] <acr>
this is what one of libera's mods said: "if the channel is opless we can op someone in the channel if everyone therein agrees, alternatively a project can claim a channel, which is another process."

[04:39:18.0042] <Domenic>
I don't believe anyone here has ever heard of that IRC channel, so I don't think anyone's going to step up to help with it.

yeah that's fine, but notice that 3 users here did

May I ask a stupid question: what is "WHATWG"?

annevk: Does Tracking Prevention impact the `ping` attribute in webkit?

[04:50:28.0558] <annevk>
I don't think so. Also not immediately clear that it should as it doesn't disable JavaScript either.

[05:11:27.0835] <zcorpan>
annevk: context: https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/1212#issuecomment-2834180558

[05:16:05.0658] <zcorpan>
Hmmm, the ping destination doesn't have a means to store cookies or so, so cross-site tracking with `ping` is not possible, right?

[05:25:04.0217] <zcorpan>
https://webkit.org/blog/8821/link-click-analytics-and-privacy/ "So our approach is to have ITP block cookies and downgrade the referrer header (see the section on Origin-Only Referrer in our ITP 2.0 blog post) for all the link click analytics techniques listed when the request goes to a third-party domain classified with cross-site tracking capabilities."
