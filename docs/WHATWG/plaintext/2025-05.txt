Domenic: https://github.com/speced/bikeshed/issues/2270 might be of interest

[00:05:25.0276] <Domenic>
Yeah, I saw that. No strong opinion.

freddy: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/243#issuecomment-2844102645 seems concerning, if strict-dynamic is still considered the best policy

[01:22:52.0101] <evilpie>
strict-dynamic is definitely far from the best policy. Maybe the easiest for some to get started.

Dunno if "best", it might just be that the success from Goog is specific to their org's shape rather than universally great ðŸ¤·

freddy: I guess I'm trying to determine if we ended up in a situation where one part of Google cares about a particular shape of CSP and another part cares about module scripts, but never the two shall meet.

Who is the channel op of irc #whatwg on libera.chat? Can we set a topic and ask people to come here instead? Is it customary/proper to readonly the irc channel too?
