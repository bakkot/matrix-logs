Domenic: https://github.com/speced/bikeshed/issues/2270 might be of interest

[00:05:25.0276] <Domenic>
Yeah, I saw that. No strong opinion.

freddy: https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/243#issuecomment-2844102645 seems concerning, if strict-dynamic is still considered the best policy

[01:22:52.0101] <evilpie>
strict-dynamic is definitely far from the best policy. Maybe the easiest for some to get started.

[07:20:59.0157] <freddy>
Dunno if "best", it might just be that the success from Goog is specific to their org's shape rather than universally great ðŸ¤·

[09:13:37.0477] <annevk>
freddy: I guess I'm trying to determine if we ended up in a situation where one part of Google cares about a particular shape of CSP and another part cares about module scripts, but never the two shall meet.

Who is the channel op of irc #whatwg on libera.chat? Can we set a topic and ask people to come here instead? Is it customary/proper to readonly the irc channel too?

[19:27:13.0938] <ljharb>
nobody is, itâ€™s unowned and canâ€™t get an op unless everyone leaves

[03:42:23.0402] <acr>
they can transfer the ownership in libera.chat

[03:42:33.0334] <acr>
at least they say so in their site

[03:42:40.0691] <acr>
* at least they say so in their site ljharb 

[03:43:27.0444] <acr>
as long as a representative of whatwg claims it, they should put the rep of whatwg as moderator

[03:57:31.0769] <acr>
* at least that seems from  https://libera.chat/chanreg/ [@ljharb:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@ljharb:matrix.org) ?

[04:13:09.0528] <acr>
this is what one of libera's mods said: "if the channel is opless we can op someone in the channel if everyone therein agrees, alternatively a project can claim a channel, which is another process."

I don't believe anyone here has ever heard of that IRC channel, so I don't think anyone's going to step up to help with it.
