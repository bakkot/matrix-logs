That would be super old, but it was indeed discussed back when <svg:video> was proposed: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2003May/0005.html

Lea Verou: not sure, but HTML should probably define some of it eventually.

Meghan Denny: thanks for dealing with the spam!

Luke Warlow: did you consider giving ReflectEnum all the values needed instead? `ReflectEnum=(enumToUse, "anonymous", "anonymous", null)` or some such (probably incorrect example).

Hmm I hadn't actually, would require slightly funky grammar but that's not insurmountable.

Could also just have multiple extended attributes but still put those on the idl attribute.

Problem then is you duplicate the values between usages of the same enum (fetch priority, cross origin)

[07:49:18.0247] <annevk>
Oh yeah, hmm.

[07:50:04.0977] <annevk>
Okay, so turning an enum into not-quite-an-enum still looks like the best course of action.

[07:57:33.0952] <Luke Warlow>
The grammar to annotate the enum values is a trivial change (updated my parser easily enough), so provided we can work the prose out I think that design is probably best
