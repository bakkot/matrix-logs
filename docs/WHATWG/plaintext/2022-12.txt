https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74630989/why-use-domstringlist-rather-than-an-array is probably worth an answer from somebody familiar, with details on its history (from somebody familiar with its history)

I don‚Äôt know enough to answer well there. I guess `DOMStringList` started out as something used in `window.location`‚Ä¶ for some reason, and then it got used with IndexedDB‚Ä¶ for some reason ‚Äî but then not used anywhere else, and won‚Äôt be, because `sequence<DOMString>` is the thing to use instead?

Answered. That was a fun one.

wow yeah, really great answer ‚Äî thanks much

By the way, https://w3c.github.io/stackoverflow/ is a dashboard thing I put together recently ‚Äî for daily review of Stack Overflow Q&As for web-platform features (in part as a way to help get a better understanding of which web-platform features developers are actually using, and what their common pain points are)

It is just a set of links to some tag-based searches. If you mouse over the names of the feature sets like **Core** and **Graphics+typography**, it‚Äôll show you which tags it‚Äôs searching on. Or else if you just follow the links, the search-results pages all also show which tags the results are for.

[03:43:35.0068] <Domenic>
Oh, fun!

annevk: re https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1520#discussion_r1037244005 do you have an example of a case where a internal model is specified?

[12:32:19.0260] <TabAtkins>
annevk: I'm trying to figure out how to say "if a URL's fragment is an ID reference" (rather than a Media Fragment, or one of those SVG fragment functions, or the like). Any opinions on how to phrase this?

[12:32:30.0949] <TabAtkins>
(I just need to carve out those other cases as Explicitly Undefined right now.)

[12:35:52.0876] <TabAtkins>
possibly the answer is to just not do that, and instead just unreservedly attempt to find an element with the given ID, and if it fails, handle the failure generically.

[12:36:04.0241] <TabAtkins>
(context: i'm cleaning up the spec text for https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3320)

[13:01:21.0391] <annevk>
TabAtkins: perhaps HTML's fragment navigation thingie needs an abstraction, but that's where I'd look

[13:02:19.0052] <TabAtkins>
I'm end-running around the thing, since I need to handle "can't find the ID" the same way as "isn't an ID ref at all" anyway

dlrobertson: Headers/Response/Request all do it pretty well I think

[13:03:14.0762] <dlrobertson>
üëçÔ∏è thanks I'll take a look

[13:03:37.0133] <annevk>
(really most WHATWG documents are good at separating private from public API)

[13:07:45.0788] <TabAtkins>
annevk: Hm, the "find a potential indicated element" is what I'm reproducing manually right now, so it would be nice to use it, but the algo specifies its "root" argument as a Document, not Document or ShadowRoot

[13:08:02.0436] <TabAtkins>
Well, I'm not doing the a-name resolution, but I could take or leave that
