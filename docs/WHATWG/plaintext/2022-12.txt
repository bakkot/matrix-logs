https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74630989/why-use-domstringlist-rather-than-an-array is probably worth an answer from somebody familiar, with details on its history (from somebody familiar with its history)

I don’t know enough to answer well there. I guess `DOMStringList` started out as something used in `window.location`… for some reason, and then it got used with IndexedDB… for some reason — but then not used anywhere else, and won’t be, because `sequence<DOMString>` is the thing to use instead?

By the way, https://w3c.github.io/stackoverflow/ is a dashboard thing I put together recently — for daily review of Stack Overflow Q&As for web-platform features (in part as a way to help get a better understanding of which web-platform features developers are actually using, and what their common pain points are)

It is just a set of links to some tag-based searches. If you mouse over the names of the feature sets like **Core** and **Graphics+typography**, it’ll show you which tags it’s searching on. Or else if you just follow the links, the search-results pages all also show which tags the results are for.

Oh, fun!

annevk: re https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1520#discussion_r1037244005 do you have an example of a case where a internal model is specified?

annevk: I'm trying to figure out how to say "if a URL's fragment is an ID reference" (rather than a Media Fragment, or one of those SVG fragment functions, or the like). Any opinions on how to phrase this?

[12:32:30.0949] <TabAtkins>
(I just need to carve out those other cases as Explicitly Undefined right now.)
