https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74630989/why-use-domstringlist-rather-than-an-array is probably worth an answer from somebody familiar, with details on its history (from somebody familiar with its history)

I don’t know enough to answer well there. I guess `DOMStringList` started out as something used in `window.location`… for some reason, and then it got used with IndexedDB… for some reason — but then not used anywhere else, and won’t be, because `sequence<DOMString>` is the thing to use instead?
