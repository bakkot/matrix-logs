I may have gotten emails working from wiki.whatwg.org, if anyone wants to test the "forgot my password" link. (I cannot test it for another 24 hours...)

[13:38:38.0014] <Ian Hickson>
why on earth is getGamePads on Navigator

[15:17:12.0732] <Domenic>
There is some superstition about putting things on the global so people started using navigator as a dumping ground

[15:17:22.0927] <Domenic>
I try to discourage it when possible but hard to catch everything

[15:57:26.0462] <Ian Hickson>
so weird

Hi, I am reading HTML living standard. I do not quite understand the syntax used here. https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#source-size-list

[16:14:58.0392] <krave>
Where can I find explainations about these syntax?

[16:15:29.0167] <emilio>
krave: that's CSS syntax: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax/

[16:18:40.0760] <krave>
For example, the brackets, sharp, comma, and question mark in `[ <source-size># , ]? <source-size-value>`

[16:20:39.0622] <krave>

Thank you emilio . That looks like a very big document though. 

[16:21:03.0958] <krave>
Any hint about this specific sentance? `[ <source-size># , ]? <source-size-value>`

[16:42:54.0045] <emilio>
krave: I guess https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#value-defs is the document that actually defines those combinators

[16:43:00.0215] <emilio>
What about that specific bit?

[16:43:23.0729] <emilio>
`#` is a multiplier as per https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-4/#component-multipliers

[16:43:51.0815] <emilio>
so that means, "optionally, `<source-size>`s separated by commas, then one mandatory `<source-size-value>`"

[16:43:53.0798] <emilio>
 * so that means, "optionally, `<source-size>`s separated by commas, then one mandatory `<source-size-value>`"

> <@tabatkins:matrix.org> zcorpan: Yeah, looks like the server wedged itself yesterday morning. Kicking it now.

Seems like it's still failing - LINK ERROR: No 'dfn' refs found for 'expose legacy touch event apis'.

[10:08:47.0699] <c_a-g_o>
WTF is a popsicle?

[10:14:44.0164] <annevk>
zcorpan: could it be because it's not a generated document? ReSpec tends to have issues

[10:16:00.0652] <annevk>
zcorpan: hardlinking from DOM might be the way to go, same as we do for DOMHighResTimeStamp and friends

[10:16:31.0890] <zcorpan>
annevk: ah yeah maybe that's the issue. ok

[10:16:48.0906] <annevk>
I wish folks would stop using ReSpec, but then we still have Wattsi so...

[10:17:22.0413] <c_a-g_o>
wattsi ReSpec

[10:17:59.0836] <zcorpan>
Maybe bikeshed could use Webref instead of scraping?

[10:18:32.0558] <annevk>
There's an issue for that somewhere

[11:10:52.0188] <TabAtkins>
Yes, last time I worked on it I got 99% of the way thru but WebIDL was suddenly causing weird biblio entries that I *coudl not* figure out, so I stalled. Working on tangential code-quality stuff in the area instead right now, but it's in my OKRs for the quarter.

[11:12:03.0730] <TabAtkins>
emilio, krave: Yes, the CSS Values & Units spec is the defining doc for CSS's value grammar. (The Syntax spec just adds some additional bits for defining *whole rules*, which aren't covered by the V&U stuff since it's not needed.)

[11:13:51.0418] <TabAtkins>
zcorpan: Tho moving to WebRef is the correct idea, I'll note that Bikeshed subtly encouraging ReSpec users to *actually publish a formatted document instead of inflicting the rest of us with the flash-of-plain-text spec* is a Good Thing imo

[11:45:52.0723] <zcorpan>
TabAtkins: agreed

[12:29:31.0140] <zcorpan>
TabAtkins: filing issues on such specs might be more effective though, in this case the editors of the spec aren't the ones to feel the pain
