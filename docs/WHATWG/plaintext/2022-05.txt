I may have gotten emails working from wiki.whatwg.org, if anyone wants to test the "forgot my password" link. (I cannot test it for another 24 hours...)

why on earth is getGamePads on Navigator

[15:17:12.0732] <Domenic>
There is some superstition about putting things on the global so people started using navigator as a dumping ground

[15:17:22.0927] <Domenic>
I try to discourage it when possible but hard to catch everything

[15:57:26.0462] <Ian Hickson>
so weird

Hi, I am reading HTML living standard. I do not quite understand the syntax used here. https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#source-size-list

[16:14:58.0392] <krave>
Where can I find explainations about these syntax?

krave: that's CSS syntax: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax/
