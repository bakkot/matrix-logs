is there a spec reference for prefetch using `Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty`? (cc Noam Rosenthal)

 * is there a spec reference for prefetch using `Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty`? (cc Noam Rosenthal)
it makes sense (to me) but not sure if there's an explicit reference which should be used

[01:31:07.0666] <Noam Rosenthal>
canadahonk: yes! https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#link-type-prefetch:fetch-and-process-the-linked-resource (#3)

[01:32:42.0397] <canadahonk>
thanks!

Domenic: so when I click on any of the types/objects in https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#ArrayBufferView I end up in the same place as when I click those linked from https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-typed-array-type

[05:20:47.0988] <annevk>
Domenic: so at least fundamentally it seems like Web IDL treats them as interchangeable already

[05:22:05.0129] <annevk>
I guess I should leave that as a comment in the PR. Also found https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/#convert-value-to-key thanks to dontcallmedom

[05:28:47.0839] <Domenic>
annevk: yes. I don't think that changes my point that "typed array types" is a concept you reference when talking about types, whereas `Uint8Array` is a concept you reference when talking about either types or instances.

[05:30:14.0021] <Domenic>
We say "a `Uint8Array`" as a shorthand for "a `Uint8Array` instance", and we say "`Uint8Array`" as a shorthand for "the `Uint8Array` type". But we don't say "x is a typed array type" when x is an instance. We can say "x is a `ArrayBufferView` (instance)" if we want though.

[05:31:51.0205] <annevk>
Domenic: I'm pretty sure there's precedent for "x is A or B" and then using "x" in that sense, e.g., in DOM

[05:32:11.0708] <annevk>
Domenic: I guess you're saying there's some magic imbued by it being in Web IDL in this particular section, but that seems super weird

[05:32:22.0833] <Domenic>
I don't think there is when "A" or "B" have "type" in their <dfn> string.

[05:34:40.0907] <annevk>
Okay, so the magic is imbued by "type", that seems even worse, if we ever had `MIMEType` or equivalent

[05:35:29.0127] <annevk>
I don't mind upholding the fiction for now and no longer exporting these terms (apart from buffer source types they don't appear to be used elsewhere), but this doesn't seem like a tenable solution long term

[05:36:20.0285] <Domenic>
I don't think it's magic, it's just staying consistent with how Web IDL is defining terms.

[05:36:51.0226] <Domenic>
Like definitely if you're using "type" in some sense other than "type in a formal type system" (e.g., MIME type) then you don't need to follow this idea.

[05:37:20.0897] <Domenic>
ES has a similar distinction since it's also defining a formal type system

[05:38:15.0640] <Domenic>
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-language-types-boolean-type vs. https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-terms-and-definitions-boolean-value

[05:39:00.0338] <Domenic>
and then informally "a Boolean" is shorthand for "a Boolean value", but you don't say "true is a Boolean type"

[05:56:53.0601] <annevk>
ES seems to have _String_ vs String though, at least

[05:57:06.0637] <annevk>
or even _String type_ vs String

[05:57:18.0783] <annevk>
And they're not saying "_String type_ is a String"

[08:24:09.0676] <Ehsan Azari>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> We say "a `Uint8Array`" as a shorthand for "a `Uint8Array` instance", and we say "`Uint8Array`" as a shorthand for "the `Uint8Array` type". But we don't say "x is a typed array type" when x is an instance. We can say "x is a `ArrayBufferView` (instance)" if we want though.

I should read spec, does it cover uniform array views? or just DataView which are slower than uniform array views
Also covers other things like `Float64Arrays`

In ES, <dfn>'s CSS is italics.

[23:45:54.0607] <annevk>
Domenic: fair. I think I still can't use the typedefs though because that would not obviously allow for resizable buffers

[23:47:12.0187] <annevk>
Domenic: I guess I should just introduce some terms for the "values"

[23:47:22.0316] <Domenic>
Or just say "an instance of one of the buffer source types"

[23:47:30.0621] <Domenic>
Or define new typedefs if they're useful

[23:48:00.0625] <Domenic>
Actually I'm not sure what's wrong with the typedefs...

[23:48:32.0728] <Domenic>
> To create one of the buffer view types from a byte sequence bytes in a realm realm:

Here "buffer view types" links to a dfn that says it's DataView + Uint8Array + ...

[23:48:50.0325] <Domenic>
But we already have a typedef for that: ArrayBufferView

[23:49:45.0269] <annevk>
I'm not saying my current wording works with my new understanding of types, but https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#AllowResizable suggests it creates a new IDL type

[23:50:50.0145] <Domenic>
Yeah, I guess the question is whether the "create" algorithm is meant to allow creating resizable ABs etc.

[23:50:56.0946] <Domenic>
But presumably some of them are

[23:51:16.0744] <Domenic>
E.g. "byte length"

[23:51:30.0739] <Domenic>
So for "byte length" could you use `AllowSharedBufferSource`?

[23:51:44.0290] <annevk>
That still doesn't include AllowResizable

[23:51:54.0594] <Domenic>
Got it

[23:51:58.0198] <Domenic>
So, preexisting issue

[23:52:42.0025] <Domenic>
I guess you have to say "annotated type whose inner type is..." and then you have to use "instance" because you're in type-land

[23:52:43.0162] <annevk>
Yeah I suppose, WebKit doesn't seem to have AllowResizable

[23:53:00.0273] <annevk>
Domenic: that doesn't help with `for` though

[23:53:23.0440] <Domenic>
I think having `for` not be rigorous is OK

[23:53:30.0552] <annevk>
oh

[23:54:25.0666] <Domenic>
Making people type `[=[AllowResizable] Uint8Array/byte length=]` instead of `[=Uint8Array/byte length=]` seems unnecessary, even if they're technically operating on a value whose type is `[AllowResizable] Uint8Array`

[23:55:20.0565] <annevk>
We could define `InclusiveAllowSharedBufferSource` I suppose, hmm

[23:55:39.0485] <annevk>
Well I would expect something like "buffer objects/byte length" maybe

[23:55:53.0574] <annevk>
But I could live with not fixing it, certainly less to fix downstream

[23:56:09.0861] <Domenic>
It's true we probably do need a typedef that includes [AllowResizable]

[23:56:19.0745] <Domenic>
Is anyone using [AllowResizable]? Hmm.

[23:56:33.0280] <Domenic>
WebDex says no https://dontcallmedom.github.io/webdex/a.html#AllowResizable%40%40%40%40extended-attribute

[23:56:47.0316] <Domenic>
But yeah it seems likely anyone who did use it would quickly want a typedef

[23:57:00.0895] <Domenic>
Either AllowResizableBufferSource or AllowSharedAndResizableBufferSource

[23:57:16.0680] <Domenic>
(shared and resizable = growable, I guess??)

[00:07:06.0252] <annevk>
Domenic: yeah maybe, I don't really know what kind of operations you need with resizable, perhaps we should wait until someone actually attempts to do it

[00:07:16.0768] <Domenic>
Yeah fair enough

[00:07:58.0652] <annevk>
Domenic: I guess I'll restore the existing `for` attributes and such and file a follow-up issue

- so I need to back at that commit in fine detail, and trace through it, and test changes to it to try to pinpoint exactly what part of it is where the regression bug was introduced

Looking now

[05:54:04.0672] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It's not exactly what you are looking for, but with https://github.com/es-meta/esmeta you can parse the ecmascript spec and extract type definitions from it

[06:00:38.0057] <sideshowbarker>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> sideshowbarker: if you're still around, does https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9372 look good to you? I'll merge

Quick answer for now for here is: I think I am unliking to willingly implement this in the HTML Checker, because I think that on balance this restriction will end up wasting more time of HTML developer-authors than it helps others. Use cases for `summary` are very different from use cases for `button`.

For one thing, a `summary` often acts essentially as a title/heading, as far as its informational purposes go, rather than just its function. I understand and recognize the very-real accessibility problems with allowing it, and I am in no way dismissing those as being ignorable and unimportant.  But in this particular very special case, I do not judge the accessibility problems to be sufficient to merit the restriction being implemented in the HTML checker.

[06:02:22.0349] <sideshowbarker>
Incidentally, all that said, I would have sworn that the spec previously already this restriction (and I had been already intentionally not implementing it), and I so I am a bit surprised to discover that the spec has actually not had this restriction, and this PR is needed to add it.

[06:02:57.0830] <sideshowbarker>
I need to make time to go back and figure out _why_ I had thought this restriction was already in the spec.

[06:03:33.0867] <annevk>
Alright, if you could put your concerns in the issue or PR that would be good. If it's not going to be enforced there's no real reason to make the change.

[06:03:53.0063] <sideshowbarker>
Well I may really be in the wrong side of this

[06:03:56.0869] <annevk>
Or at least it warrants some further discussion I think

[06:04:07.0522] <sideshowbarker>
for sure

[06:06:31.0657] <sideshowbarker>
and for now, I will put the comments into the PR — and then find some time to look back through my stuff and try to see what had confused previously about this already being in the spec. I guess that’s moot/irrelevant anyway as far as this PR goes — but it’s just I feel unsettled about not being able to remember yet why I had this apparent misapprehension so far, about this being in the spec already

[06:06:46.0400] <sideshowbarker>
thanks for the heads-up about the PR

[06:07:28.0121] <sideshowbarker>
I had actually seen notifications about that PR rolling by, but been lazy about not actually going to take a look and read the issue description

[07:32:01.0445] <sideshowbarker>

There you go. I think there are many other existing uses that it would outlaw — all over the place. I think if we look, we could find plenty of them — because it’s actually a logical normal natural reasonable use case to anybody

[07:33:16.0454] <sideshowbarker>
I am recalling some of this, and what led me before to already having come to the the conclusion that I would not implement it

[07:33:24.0624] <sideshowbarker>
 * I am recalling some of this, and what led me before to already having come to the conclusion that I would not implement it

[07:33:26.0217] <annevk>

I hope you did not provide pushback before and that was not conveyed to us this time around...

[07:35:03.0028] <annevk>
Anyway, no harm done (and we could have always reverted had it been merged, although that would be somewhat bad)

[07:36:15.0627] <sideshowbarker>
Yeah — and I know when I say this that it’s a standard cop-out we have been accused of using since forever in discussions with the accessibility advocates — but it really seems like what needs to happen here is for the AT to be refined to provide the right UX for this

[07:36:36.0542] <sideshowbarker>
I mean, it’s in the wild already being used very commonly for years

[07:37:11.0438] <sideshowbarker>

[10:56:50.0479] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
Also, my reading of https://whatpr.org/html/8008/images.html#parsing-a-sizes-attribute is that once you've specified `loading=lazy`, an img will behave equivalently with or without `sizes=auto`. Aka lazy-loaded images get auto-sizes by default. Is that right?

One concrete thing I can do that with give us some actual data ー though _aggregated_ data, as opposed to a list of sites ー is: I can add a use counter to the HTML checker, and then take a look at the number from that, after the counter has been in there for a few days

[15:07:05.0566] <sideshowbarker>
That is, the counter will give us a percentage of sites which are using interactive content or tabindex inside `summary`

[15:09:07.0422] <sideshowbarker>
...and in parallel to me adding that ice counter, zcorpan or somebody else here who's set up to run HTTPArchive queries can run one for this

Pretty cool. One thing that might be nice is highlighting how up-to-date you currently are. For jsdom/whatwg-url I link to the commit hash of the spec I've most recently updated to. https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url#specification-conformance If you put in more work you could translate that into "# of commits behind whatwg/url main".

Thanks much. I had expected a lot more usage than 0.82%. That makes me see that having the HTML checker report an error would not be disruptive to as many developers as I had imagined it might be.

Well it's significantly high by our normal thresholds for feature deprecations. But for the thresholds I have used for the HTML checker in past cases, it's not high.

[01:15:36.0159] <sideshowbarker>
> <@zcorpan:mozilla.org> so then 91% of pages using `summary` also use interactive content

Oh wow yeah then that changes my mind completely.  Forget everything else I just said. The how-many-summary-have-interactive-content is what we need to care about here. And of course having the checker disrupt things for 91% of the developers using summary is nowhere close to be acceptable. It's a complete non-starter.

This was bogus, since `summary` usage has increased since sep 2022 :) New query with the same dataset gives 226,719 sites using `summary`, so it's "only" 46% of sites using `summary` also using interactive content in `summary`

Ah ok. But 46% is still not anywhere even close to be acceptable for the checker to be reporting errors about. 

[01:32:06.0771] <sideshowbarker>
This week I will try to add a use counter to the checker, to see how well it aligns with that number.

[01:32:57.0141] <zcorpan>
sideshowbarker: also we might need to solve how to make nested interactive content work well so that the UX isn't broken for 0.82% of sites

[01:55:18.0894] <Domenic>
https://github.com/w3c/html-aam/issues/345#issuecomment-931495836 discusses that. I guess at least Facebook's accessibility specialist thinks it's too hard: " Whenever I try to imagine a way to solve all the problems associated with that, my brain feels like it falls into a bottomless hurt pit."

[01:56:19.0707] <Domenic>
I think it's sad when accessibility experts say that giving AT users experience parity with mouse/keyboard users is too hard, but, to be fair, I haven't tried to write AT software myself.

[09:32:46.0245] <zcorpan>
Eric Portis (he/him): I changed it to remove weird behaviors of `img`

[09:33:16.0102] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
@zcorpan ok. Does sizes=auto have to contend with those weird behaviors?

[09:33:47.0226] <zcorpan>
Eric Portis (he/him): the size is 0 if it's inline or inline-block and no width or min-width, for example

[09:37:40.0015] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
I guess my question is, will the concrete size ignoring natural dimensions in this example be 60em, even though what's getting logged is 0px: https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=11742 If so why?

[09:39:43.0662] <zcorpan>
Eric Portis (he/him): oh right it's 0px because img is a replaced element. So my `span` example is wrong

[09:40:54.0345] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
Ok! So both of the gist examples are correct, and this is testable by putting an empty img in a layout and looking at its dimensions.

[09:42:07.0693] <zcorpan>
Eric Portis (he/him): I think so, but might need to use `alt=""` so that the alt text doesn't affect sizing when testing since alt isn't shown while loading

[09:42:57.0206] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
zcorpan: makes sense. Thanks!

[10:02:15.0148] <zcorpan>
Eric Portis (he/him): to be sure fallback doesn't affect sizing, use a very-slow-loading image

[10:04:53.0609] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
zcorpan: what do you mean by “fallback”?

[10:05:17.0656] <zcorpan>
Eric Portis (he/him): "showing alt"

[10:06:01.0810] <zcorpan>
even if the empty string, there can be a difference between inline box and replaced inline box

[10:09:46.0981] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
zcorpan: ok. I don’t see any differences in Safari/FF/Chrime but I’ll take your word for it that that’s not necessarily spec’s/guaranteed

3 different results in 3 browser engines, good times!

[10:22:06.0523] <zcorpan>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#images-3 - ah actually `alt=""` means it "repesents nothing" (if there's no image), and so it should act as a 0x0 replaced element

[16:30:08.0134] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
zcorpan: so an <img alt=""> should behave the same, for sizes="auto"-testing purposes, as an <img src="5-second-ttfb.jpeg" /> or whatever. Because the [default object size](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-images/#default-object-size) of both a [loading image](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-images/#loading-image) and an ["img element that represents nothing and the user agent does not expect this to change"](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#images-3) are both 0x0.

[16:46:20.0017] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
zcorpan: although according to the loading image definition, images in this state "may trigger fallback rendering". Is there anything in the "concrete object size ignoring natural dimensions" spec that forbids fallback rendering dimensions from being used?

Hi! can someone help merge this editorial typo fix: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9388 ?

[01:13:51.0468] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: note that `className` is already defined on `Element` as I pointed out earlier; I guess SVG overrides it, though you could probably use the other one if you really wanted to

[01:15:39.0351] <Jake Archibald>
annevk: when did you previously point that out? (Or do you mean `classList`?)

[01:19:49.0379] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: I pointed out in the issue that it's defined in DOM so the request should maybe be tracked there

[01:20:21.0108] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: don't blame you for missing it though, there's a lot of noise :-)

[01:22:30.0372] <Jake Archibald>
annevk: ahh I did see that, but I didn't join the dots to "it's on `Element`"

[01:22:40.0370] <Jake Archibald>
But yeah, that makes sense

[01:46:59.0087] <Jake Archibald>

[04:10:35.0981] <Ms2ger>
annevk: yeah, proposals are done in a fork of the main spec repo, which is merged into it occasionally. The result is rendered if someone managed to get the CI working

Hey folks, question on the Storage spec. I'm trying to get a callback for every site that accesses any form of non-cookie storage. Looking at the spec https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/, which is the best algorithm to monkey patch? I'm considering "obtain a storage bottle map / shelf / key", but I'm not clear on the flow. Are these called once the first time an origin accesses local or session storage, and never before then? Could the browser run them for a non-site reason?

Question about differing behavior in FF and Chrome when focusing outside of a contenteditable with inline-block vs grid. Click below the contenteditable: https://jsfiddle.net/swk91rpx/ Notice for grid it finds the first text content and places the cursor in it in Chrome. I suspect this is a bug in Chrome as I think this happened with inline-block 7 years ago and was changed. Anyone familiar with this topic and could clarify the expected behavior so I know where to file this. (For all I know this edge-case is right for chrome and FF is the one handling it wrong).

[00:41:56.0478] <annevk>
Anton Maliev: that might be correct, yeah; problem is that not everything has been refactored and we have been running into some issues with this abstraction

[00:42:31.0292] <annevk>
Anton Maliev: filing an issue and copying inexorabletash and asuth might be a good start

[00:44:02.0076] <annevk>
sirisian: filing an issue against all of https://github.com/w3c/contentEditable/issues/new, Chromium, and Gecko seems like a good start

[00:44:41.0664] <annevk>
sirisian: unfortunately the spec is not maintained so this has to be addressed on a case-by-case basis and likely slowly

[03:02:44.0081] <Andreu Botella>
That might also be a hit testing issue, rather than a contenteditable issue

[03:03:02.0667] <Andreu Botella>

[03:17:33.0290] <zcorpan>
> <@etportis:matrix.org> zcorpan: so an <img alt=""> should behave the same, for sizes="auto"-testing purposes, as an <img src="5-second-ttfb.jpeg" /> or whatever. Because the [default object size](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-images/#default-object-size) of both a [loading image](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-images/#loading-image) and an ["img element that represents nothing and the user agent does not expect this to change"](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#images-3) are both 0x0.

> <@etportis:matrix.org> zcorpan: although according to the loading image definition, images in this state "may trigger fallback rendering". Is there anything in the "concrete object size ignoring natural dimensions" spec that forbids fallback rendering dimensions from being used?

zcorpan: re: you not following, yes -- ignore me, I was confused. Even if the fallback representation is showing, that only adds an intrinsic size, it doesn't change the default or specified sizes.

IIUC from https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/862 and https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-request-header, the limit before a preflight is required is 128 bytes.

But images are requested early, so maybe Client Hints could be a useful tool here.

Event loops are per-agent, not per-document. All tasks are tagged with a document though, and those coming from "not fully active" documents (including those in bfcache) will not run, while in bfcache.

The question was basically about newlines/minification. Do we have data that would help inform us how much of the web is minified? What %age of web pages would be left unprotected by this?

> <@zcorpan:mozilla.org> ok now I don't know for how long this frustration has been building up haha https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8959

the thing that gets me really is how inconsistent it is as to whether it's normative or not 😐️

[05:08:45.0628] <zcorpan>
freddy: I could find out but web pages might be a mashup where some parts are minimized and some are not... Maybe I can count the number of `\r?\n`s

[05:09:34.0235] <freddy>
To be quick. I think this is worth following without the comment. I also think it's worth tracking this as a next step though.

Hmm, I see _ before any() in https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-AbortSignal

[07:01:59.0700] <annevk>
smaug: yes, that's IDL

[07:02:15.0174] <annevk>
smaug: we should probably figure out a way to fix the Web IDL parser since this is confusing people

> <@zcorpan:mozilla.org> hacknorris: if the DTD is in the external subset and you have a non-validating UA then it won't read the DTD. You need to have the default value declarations at least in the internal subset. But also, why are you using DTDs at all?

why i use? mainly for testing ( i know, maybe reinventing html wheel is bad but i just wanted to code a little 😆 ). thx for info btw

I wonder what the story behind this RFC standardizing C header and implementation files is. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6234#section-8
