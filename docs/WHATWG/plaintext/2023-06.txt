it makes sense (to me) but not sure if there's an explicit reference which should be used

canadahonk: yes! https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#link-type-prefetch:fetch-and-process-the-linked-resource (#3)

Domenic: so when I click on any of the types/objects in https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#ArrayBufferView I end up in the same place as when I click those linked from https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-typed-array-type

Domenic: so at least fundamentally it seems like Web IDL treats them as interchangeable already

I guess I should leave that as a comment in the PR. Also found https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/#convert-value-to-key thanks to dontcallmedom
