> <@aliaksandr.kalenik:matrix.org> hey, I am going through Navigables spec and got a bit confused by HTML document loading step: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-lifecycle.html#navigate-html which is 11.1 step in "Populating a session history entry".

I have vague idea that processResponseEndOfBody should be specified to do something about firing "load" event (which is also confusing because document does not exist on the step that does fetch call so callback cannot capture it). And I am wondering on what step and using what mechanism response body should be piped into HTML parser.

My take last time I looked at this is that we'd use processResponse, incrementally read from the stream to feed it into the parser (replacing step 2), and when there's nothing more in the stream, do the end of step 2. It's not immediately clear how to fit this into an algorithm which currently does a synchronous return of _document_.

[17:53:34.0303] <Domenic>
Also it's not immediately clear how to fit this with the existing use of processResponse in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#create-navigation-params-by-fetching . But these problems are mostly about how to restructure the algorithms, ideally without making them even harder to read than they currently are.

[17:54:30.0118] <Domenic>
Hmm I guess maybe we just wouldn't use procesResponse in #navigate-html. We just use processResponse to save it into the navigation params, and then we can incrementally read it later. So that isn't a big deal.

thank you for having a look! yeah, reading in #navigate-html response saved in navigation params earlier in #create-navigation-params-by-fetching by procesResponse is the way I went for now.

> <@annevk:matrix.org> snek: some stuff can take a long time for sure, but it's better to have it recorded than not recorded

i don't care about the time. the issue is the power dynamic. i really wish this standards body would reconsider how people who do not happen to be employed by apple or mozilla or google can actually drive improvements forward of their own volition.

snek: how do you anticipate this being done, if none of the browsers are interested in your change? Put stuff in standards which no browsers ship?

[17:45:44.0021] <Domenic>
Ultimately, we are writing standards about what those browsers ship. If we're not doing that, there's no point. Participation here is open and welcome (unlike other SDOs, no paying needed!) but yes, if you don't get your change agreed to be shipped by those organizations, you can't accomplish much.

[17:46:02.0820] <snek>
i've never had to beg browsers to want to implement my thing at tc39

[17:46:16.0698] <snek>
maybe take a look at their process

[17:46:59.0777] <Domenic>
Yes, you have. They've decided to agree, because language teams are generally sitting around looking for things to do, in my experience. (Sometimes they start whole new languages just to have something to do!)

[17:47:47.0989] <Domenic>
If they thought your thing was not worth their engineering time, they would object. That's how it works at the WHATWG too, it's just that instead of making someone stand up and say "I object", we require the proposer to get their affirmative consent

[17:48:14.0403] <snek>
whatever the case

[17:48:25.0878] <snek>
even walking to the browsers with spec, tests, and implementation work

[17:48:28.0837] <snek>
is not enough for whatwg

[17:48:40.0274] <snek>
i doubt there is a simple solution but

[17:48:47.0864] <snek>
the current process is insurmountable 

[17:48:50.0877] <Domenic>
Yep, it looks like you've had some browsers object to your feature. I'm sorry, but that happens, no matter the SDO.

[17:49:13.0643] <Domenic>
Many people surmount this; many features are shipped every release, including from non-employees. I'm sorry you had a bad experience once, but it's not representative.

[17:49:45.0086] <snek>
i mean there is a way it could get done

[17:49:49.0228] <snek>
i'm just not willing to do it
