> <@aliaksandr.kalenik:matrix.org> hey, I am going through Navigables spec and got a bit confused by HTML document loading step: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-lifecycle.html#navigate-html which is 11.1 step in "Populating a session history entry".
>

> 
> I'm curious if anyone can give a hint of how document loading might look with relevant Fetch spec taken into account. I have vague idea that processResponseEndOfBody should be specified to do something about firing "load" event (which is also confusing because document does not exist on the step that does fetch call so callback cannot capture it). And I am wondering on what step and using what mechanism response body should be piped into HTML parser.

My take last time I looked at this is that we'd use processResponse, incrementally read from the stream to feed it into the parser (replacing step 2), and when there's nothing more in the stream, do the end of step 2. It's not immediately clear how to fit this into an algorithm which currently does a synchronous return of _document_.

[17:53:34.0303] <Domenic>
Also it's not immediately clear how to fit this with the existing use of processResponse in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#create-navigation-params-by-fetching . But these problems are mostly about how to restructure the algorithms, ideally without making them even harder to read than they currently are.

[17:54:30.0118] <Domenic>
Hmm I guess maybe we just wouldn't use procesResponse in #navigate-html. We just use processResponse to save it into the navigation params, and then we can incrementally read it later. So that isn't a big deal.

thank you for having a look! yeah, reading in #navigate-html response saved in navigation params earlier in #create-navigation-params-by-fetching by procesResponse is the way I went for now.

> <@annevk:matrix.org> snek: some stuff can take a long time for sure, but it's better to have it recorded than not recorded

i don't care about the time. the issue is the power dynamic. i really wish this standards body would reconsider how people who do not happen to be employed by apple or mozilla or google can actually drive improvements forward of their own volition.

[17:44:25.0628] <Domenic>
snek: how do you anticipate this being done, if none of the browsers are interested in your change? Put stuff in standards which no browsers ship?

[17:45:44.0021] <Domenic>
Ultimately, we are writing standards about what those browsers ship. If we're not doing that, there's no point. Participation here is open and welcome (unlike other SDOs, no paying needed!) but yes, if you don't get your change agreed to be shipped by those organizations, you can't accomplish much.

[17:46:02.0820] <snek>
i've never had to beg browsers to want to implement my thing at tc39

[17:46:16.0698] <snek>
maybe take a look at their process

[17:46:59.0777] <Domenic>
Yes, you have. They've decided to agree, because language teams are generally sitting around looking for things to do, in my experience. (Sometimes they start whole new languages just to have something to do!)

[17:47:47.0989] <Domenic>
If they thought your thing was not worth their engineering time, they would object. That's how it works at the WHATWG too, it's just that instead of making someone stand up and say "I object", we require the proposer to get their affirmative consent

[17:48:14.0403] <snek>
whatever the case

[17:48:25.0878] <snek>
even walking to the browsers with spec, tests, and implementation work

[17:48:28.0837] <snek>
is not enough for whatwg

[17:48:40.0274] <snek>
i doubt there is a simple solution but

[17:48:47.0864] <snek>
the current process is insurmountable 

[17:48:50.0877] <Domenic>
Yep, it looks like you've had some browsers object to your feature. I'm sorry, but that happens, no matter the SDO.

[17:49:13.0643] <Domenic>
Many people surmount this; many features are shipped every release, including from non-employees. I'm sorry you had a bad experience once, but it's not representative.

[17:49:45.0086] <snek>
i mean there is a way it could get done

[17:49:49.0228] <snek>
i'm just not willing to do it

[17:50:08.0601] <snek>
its humiliating to have to crawl to some guys feet and ask him to pretty please consider my feature

[17:50:42.0020] <Domenic>
I guess at this point you're just being melodramatic, so this isn't a very productive conversation. I'll move on.

Is this about the WebSockets enhancement? I tend to agree I haven't seen a lot of ask for supporting non-ws(s) schemes there from web developers.

You want to put the listener on the `Window`, not the body. https://jsbin.com/pitoqeg/edit?js,console,output

streams question:

```
(async () => {
  let stream = new ReadableStream(
    {
      start(controller) {
          controller.enqueue(Promise.resolve(0)); // NOTE: enqueuing a promise
          controller.close();
      },
    },
  );
  for await (let item of stream) {
    console.log({ item });
  }
})();
```

(Streams are async iterable as of https://github.com/whatwg/streams/pull/980, though only FF has implemented as far as I know.)

Here, should the `console.log` be of `0` or of a Promise for `0`? If I'm reading the various specs right, it should be a Promise. FF has it as an actual 0. The original conversation about async iterators which yield promises (in the iterator result object) decided that it should be considered a contract violation to do so - see slide 27 of https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U6PivKbFO0YgoFlrYB82MtXf1ofCp1xSVOODOvranBM/edit#slide=id.g223fba4116_0_196

this is really an edge case, so maybe the "contract violation" is fine? it's not like the language enforces that contract. but if the intent is that it should be a Promise for 0, that probably warrants a WPT

[17:58:27.0638] <Alexander Kalenik>
a document loading question:

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-lifecycle.html#read-ua-inline
step 3 assumes there is "response" from which URL can be obtained but "response" is not listed in the parameters.
step 4 initialize navigationParams params with newly created response but step 5 that creates document using these navigationParams seems to assume that response always has non-empty URL.

am I missing something or there is a bug that "Loading a document for inline content that doesn't have a DOM" should accept url?

Looks like a bug to me. I think we can just use about:blank though instead of passing in a URL.

I think it'd be best if Web IDL enforced that such cases get unwrapped, like (IIRC) the relevant ES machinery does.

[18:02:31.0631] <bakkot>
there's not much ES machinery, but the closest things are async generators manually `yield`ing promises, and `for-await` over sync iterator of promises as in `for await (let item of [Promise.resolve(0)]) ...`, both of which do indeed unwrap

[18:03:06.0571] <Domenic>
Yes, this feels analogous to async generators manually `yield`ing promises

[18:04:39.0871] <bakkot>
unfortunately unwrapping means you have to `await` every value, which is kind of annoying. maybe there can be a check to see if the type of the iterator could be something `await`-able, so it's only in generic cases like the ReadableStream ctor rather than having to pay the cost of `await`ing for all async iterables? but on the other hand maybe not worth trying to optimize away the extra `await`.

[18:04:53.0211] <bakkot>
anyway, I'll open a webIDL issue

done: https://github.com/whatwg/webidl/issues/1288

[18:15:42.0353] <bakkot>
(also added an edge case around error handling which occurred to me while writing it.)

[21:56:59.0891] <bakkot>
ah, turns out I misread the streams spec and in fact it already unboxes (or rather the "get the next iteration result" algorithm is phrased in terms of a promise for the value, so it'll flatten promises)

[19:06:56.0011] <Domenic>
> <@tabatkins:matrix.org> Hm, *is* it actually possible to define an interface that inherits from ObservableArray?

Nope

[19:07:41.0856] <TabAtkins>
Huh, that's extremely unfortunate. It means it's impossible for us to upgrade older list-like interfaces into OA.

[19:08:24.0097] <Domenic>
It's possible someone could do the work to define that, but yeah, the idea was to use ObservableArray for all new things, since nobody has ever had the appetite to upgrade any old things

[19:27:40.0277] <TabAtkins>
Well "upgrade the old things" was a requirement for the CSSWG to agree to use OA for the new CSSStyleRule.cssRules attribute, so I guess I'll have to do the work to define that. ^^_

(Which is extremely fair; it would be terrible API to have *some* .cssRules properties be the old version and some be the new.)

[19:28:45.0456] <TabAtkins>
I've also got that iterator work to finish up on WebIDL, so I'll just spend some time on that spec in general soon.

Maybe start by opening an issue to discuss. There are at least two ways you could do it I can think of: something that does actual inheritance (so that `x.constructor.name === "CSSRuleList"`, `x.hasOwnProperty("push") === false`, but `x.hasOwnProperty("item") === true`), or something that changes the proxy that ObservableArray uses to have special behavior for the defined properties (i.e., instead of [[GetOwnProperty]] on `"item"` returning undefined/whatever gets stored there via normal property access, it returns some property descriptor for the method that we conjured up). Both are pretty subtle to actually define and I'm not sure which is best, or if there's a better third option...

[22:58:34.0776] <annevk>
zcorpan: that's not it, otherwise the second table wouldn't show up in one of the implementations; it's reset the insertion mode that does the wrong thing in Firefox (I think)
