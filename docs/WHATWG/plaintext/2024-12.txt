Curious, is it obvious to everyone that `importNode()` clones from its name?

No. Itâ€™s not *that* surprising but also not obvious I guess

small community update from ada-url.com: we added URLSearchParams to Ada on v2.9.0. right now, Iâ€™m working on adding URLSearchParams to Adaâ€™s Rust crate. https://github.com/ada-url/rust/pull/57

Apologies if this is a common question -- I searched the FAQ but I don't _think_ I saw anything https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/main/FAQ.md

Is there a canonical representation of the HTML _spec_ as opposed to the IDL (for example, the spec would specify that the `type` on a `button` is an "enumerated attribute" as opposed to a DOM string [which the IDL says])?

Certainly I could parse https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/main/source and while it's not "hard" it's a non-trivial task

There are quite a few scattered efforts out there -- e.g. https://github.com/tawesoft/html5spec

Certainly I would imagine MDN does this to prepare their documentation -- but it's not immediately clear to me how or if they do that without studying their build process a lot more

if you want to parse `source`, you'd be best off using or extending wattsi https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi
