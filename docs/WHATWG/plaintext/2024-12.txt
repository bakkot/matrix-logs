Curious, is it obvious to everyone that `importNode()` clones from its name?

No. It’s not *that* surprising but also not obvious I guess

small community update from ada-url.com: we added URLSearchParams to Ada on v2.9.0. right now, I’m working on adding URLSearchParams to Ada’s Rust crate. https://github.com/ada-url/rust/pull/57

Apologies if this is a common question -- I searched the FAQ but I don't _think_ I saw anything https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/main/FAQ.md

Is there a canonical representation of the HTML _spec_ as opposed to the IDL (for example, the spec would specify that the `type` on a `button` is an "enumerated attribute" as opposed to a DOM string [which the IDL says])?

[16:25:25.0368] <leoisverycool>
Certainly I could parse https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/main/source and while it's not "hard" it's a non-trivial task

if you want to parse `source`, you'd be best off using or extending wattsi https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi

[17:34:01.0334] <Domenic>
There is no such machine-readable format besides the source itself.

[18:34:30.0205] <leoisverycool>
>if you want to parse source, you'd be best off using or extending wattsi https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi

That makes sense. I had a look at I am impressed it is maintained and in Pascal. I agree that parsing wattsi sources (and potentially using wattsi itself) makes sense due to the useful `dfn`tag especially. For example in the case of `button`, it is helpful that `dfn` holds context for attributes:

```
  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th> Keyword
     <th> State
     <th> Brief description
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="button/type"><code
     data-x="attr-button-type-submit">submit</code></dfn>
     <td><span data-x="attr-button-type-submit-state">Submit Button</span>
     <td>Submits the form.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="button/type"><code data-x="attr-button-type-reset">reset</code></dfn>
     <td><span data-x="attr-button-type-reset-state">Reset Button</span>
     <td>Resets the form.

     data-x="attr-button-type-button">button</code></dfn>

     <td>Does nothing.

Although I don't have a specific suggestion in mind, are maintainers of `wattsi` open to contributions that would _extendi_ the language at all? I don't have anything specific in mind at the moment, but something that could potentially help the robustness of such a parser for subsequent updates to the standard.

[this isn't quite right -- but perhaps conveys the idea]

[19:41:30.0542] <Domenic>
Yes, we're quite open to that. Although it'd be even better if it could be done in the new Rust pre-processor layer, which is in a more well-known language and has nice things like unit tests. I'd be ideal if eventually we moved everything from Wattsi to Rust.

See this example issue for one such project (not quite what you're looking for, but gives an idea): https://github.com/whatwg/html-build/issues/293

See here for the Rust layer: https://github.com/whatwg/html-build/blob/main/src/main.rs

See here for some previous discussion of machine-readable stuff: https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi/issues/146 + https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1246

Small curiosity, can a node's children ever not be "in tree order"? Asking because at least in [node insert](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-insert), it's asked to iterate over a DocumentFragment's children in tree order and that seemed redundant, but maybe it's not.

[07:03:06.0023] <Ms2ger>
No, that's just saying if you have a node with children [a, b, c], you should work on a first, then b, then c

How do we want to handle https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10557 ? It looks like the boxes in OP are ticked, but it's not clear if it's web compatible yet, and there was at least one crbug filed about <select><input> (https://issues.chromium.org/issues/379612186) cc annevk

Ok, but given that a node's `children` is already an ordered set, it's thus redundant to iterate it in tree order, no? Unless its order is something else than tree order.

Maybe jarhar can give us an update on the shipping plans? Is Chromium still proceeding to ship exactly what's in the PR?

I think it might be reasonable to delay landing until it's baked in stable for a while, but we could also land and revert if it's not able to make it.

I'm not sure I follow your question - the children are ordered, and you should iterate over them in that order. You might imagine in some case you'd want to iterate over them in reverse order, or in other cases it might not matter at all

[01:35:42.0132] <Kaiido>
Yes, so my point is that in at least [node insert](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-insert), at step 7, it's asked to iterate over `children` in tree order. That made me wonder if `children` could ever not be in tree order, since it's already an ordered set (which I assume is already in tree order).  So either this "in tree order" at this step is redundant, either `children` can indeed be in an other order.

Ps: I'm fine with it being redundant, that's really just something that got me curious.

[02:02:29.0178] <Ms2ger>
I don't understand. It's not a question of whether children is in tree order or not; it's a question of the order in which you handle them

[02:03:32.0176] <Ms2ger>
Say you have a tree `<a><b></b><i></i></a>` and you say "for each child x of the a element, print the local name of x", you could print either "bi" or "ib"

[02:04:29.0472] <Noam Rosenthal>
The default order for this ordered set is "tree order" so it's redundant, but it's good to be explicit as sometimes iterations don't care about order

[02:33:04.0553] <Kaiido>
Thanks Noam. That's just what I wanted to know, and yes, I agree it's good to be explicit here.

Sorry Ms2ger I wasn't clear enough.

[02:35:15.0378] <annevk>
zcorpan: Domenic: yeah, I'd like to hear from jarhar before moving ahead. And given that there's already been some fallout maybe we should at least give it a couple of weeks of shipping.

[02:37:34.0519] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: Kaiido: when it's just children we might be able to omit the term these days, but when it's descendants we can't. That we can omit it for children is new as we didn't define their data structure until quite recently and I didn't actually think it had implications when I did that. So maybe this is something to open an issue for and figure out what we want to do.
