Curious, is it obvious to everyone that `importNode()` clones from its name?

No. Itâ€™s not *that* surprising but also not obvious I guess

small community update from ada-url.com: we added URLSearchParams to Ada on v2.9.0. right now, Iâ€™m working on adding URLSearchParams to Adaâ€™s Rust crate. https://github.com/ada-url/rust/pull/57

Apologies if this is a common question -- I searched the FAQ but I don't _think_ I saw anything https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/main/FAQ.md

Is there a canonical representation of the HTML _spec_ as opposed to the IDL (for example, the spec would specify that the `type` on a `button` is an "enumerated attribute" as opposed to a DOM string [which the IDL says])?

[16:25:25.0368] <leoisverycool>
Certainly I could parse https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/main/source and while it's not "hard" it's a non-trivial task

There are quite a few scattered efforts out there -- e.g. https://github.com/tawesoft/html5spec

[16:28:16.0298] <leoisverycool>
Certainly I would imagine MDN does this to prepare their documentation -- but it's not immediately clear to me how or if they do that without studying their build process a lot more

if you want to parse `source`, you'd be best off using or extending wattsi https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi

[17:34:01.0334] <Domenic>
There is no such machine-readable format besides the source itself.

That makes sense. I had a look at I am impressed it is maintained and in Pascal. I agree that parsing wattsi sources (and potentially using wattsi itself) makes sense due to the useful `dfn`tag especially. For example in the case of `button`, it is helpful that `dfn` holds context for attributes:

```
  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th> Keyword
     <th> State
     <th> Brief description
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="button/type"><code
     data-x="attr-button-type-submit">submit</code></dfn>
     <td><span data-x="attr-button-type-submit-state">Submit Button</span>
     <td>Submits the form.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="button/type"><code data-x="attr-button-type-reset">reset</code></dfn>
     <td><span data-x="attr-button-type-reset-state">Reset Button</span>
     <td>Resets the form.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="button/type"><code
     data-x="attr-button-type-button">button</code></dfn>
     <td><span data-x="attr-button-type-button-state">Button</span>
     <td>Does nothing.
  </table>
  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th> Keyword
     <th> State
     <th> Brief description
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="button/type"><code
     data-x="attr-button-type-submit">submit</code></dfn>
     <td><span data-x="attr-button-type-submit-state">Submit Button</span>
     <td>Submits the form.

Although I don't have a specific suggestion in mind, are maintainers of `wattsi` open to contributions that would _extendi_ the language at all? I don't have anything specific in mind at the moment, but something that could potentially help the robustness of such a parser for subsequent updates to the standard.
