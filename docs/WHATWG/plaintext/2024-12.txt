Curious, is it obvious to everyone that `importNode()` clones from its name?

No. It’s not *that* surprising but also not obvious I guess

small community update from ada-url.com: we added URLSearchParams to Ada on v2.9.0. right now, I’m working on adding URLSearchParams to Ada’s Rust crate. https://github.com/ada-url/rust/pull/57

Apologies if this is a common question -- I searched the FAQ but I don't _think_ I saw anything https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/main/FAQ.md

Is there a canonical representation of the HTML _spec_ as opposed to the IDL (for example, the spec would specify that the `type` on a `button` is an "enumerated attribute" as opposed to a DOM string [which the IDL says])?
