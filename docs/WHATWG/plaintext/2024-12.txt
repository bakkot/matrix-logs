Curious, is it obvious to everyone that `importNode()` clones from its name?

No. Itâ€™s not *that* surprising but also not obvious I guess

small community update from ada-url.com: we added URLSearchParams to Ada on v2.9.0. right now, Iâ€™m working on adding URLSearchParams to Adaâ€™s Rust crate. https://github.com/ada-url/rust/pull/57

Apologies if this is a common question -- I searched the FAQ but I don't _think_ I saw anything https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/main/FAQ.md

Is there a canonical representation of the HTML _spec_ as opposed to the IDL (for example, the spec would specify that the `type` on a `button` is an "enumerated attribute" as opposed to a DOM string [which the IDL says])?

[16:25:25.0368] <leoisverycool>
Certainly I could parse https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/main/source and while it's not "hard" it's a non-trivial task

There are quite a few scattered efforts out there -- e.g. https://github.com/tawesoft/html5spec

[16:28:16.0298] <leoisverycool>
Certainly I would imagine MDN does this to prepare their documentation -- but it's not immediately clear to me how or if they do that without studying their build process a lot more

if you want to parse `source`, you'd be best off using or extending wattsi https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi

[17:34:01.0334] <Domenic>
There is no such machine-readable format besides the source itself.

That makes sense. I had a look at I am impressed it is maintained and in Pascal. I agree that parsing wattsi sources (and potentially using wattsi itself) makes sense due to the useful `dfn`tag especially. For example in the case of `button`, it is helpful that `dfn` holds context for attributes:

```
  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th> Keyword
     <th> State
     <th> Brief description
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="button/type"><code
     data-x="attr-button-type-submit">submit</code></dfn>
     <td><span data-x="attr-button-type-submit-state">Submit Button</span>
     <td>Submits the form.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="button/type"><code data-x="attr-button-type-reset">reset</code></dfn>
     <td><span data-x="attr-button-type-reset-state">Reset Button</span>
     <td>Resets the form.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="button/type"><code
     data-x="attr-button-type-button">button</code></dfn>
     <td><span data-x="attr-button-type-button-state">Button</span>
     <td>Does nothing.
  </table>

Although I don't have a specific suggestion in mind, are maintainers of `wattsi` open to contributions that would _extendi_ the language at all? I don't have anything specific in mind at the moment, but something that could potentially help the robustness of such a parser for subsequent updates to the standard.

For example, I could envision a collection of tags that could be used to articulate each dom element, would retain searchability within `wattsi` sources, yet could reduce boilerplate.

Here is a very rough example:

```
<h4 split-filename="form-elements">The <dfn element><code>button</code></dfn> element</h4>

<element name="button">
  <categories>
    Flow content, Phrasing content, Interactive content, Palpable content
    Listed, Labelable, Submittable, Autocapitalize-and-autocorrect inheriting
  </categories>

  <contexts>
    Where phrasing content is expected
  </contexts>

  <content-model>
    Phrasing content, no interactive content descendant, no tabindex attribute descendant
  </content-model>

  <attributes>
    Global attributes
    disabled, form, formaction, formenctype, formmethod, formnovalidate, formtarget
    name, popovertarget, popovertargetaction, type, value
  </attributes>

[this isn't quite right -- but perhaps conveys the idea]

[19:41:30.0542] <Domenic>
Yes, we're quite open to that. Although it'd be even better if it could be done in the new Rust pre-processor layer, which is in a more well-known language and has nice things like unit tests. I'd be ideal if eventually we moved everything from Wattsi to Rust.

See this example issue for one such project (not quite what you're looking for, but gives an idea): https://github.com/whatwg/html-build/issues/293

See here for the Rust layer: https://github.com/whatwg/html-build/blob/main/src/main.rs

See here for some previous discussion of machine-readable stuff: https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi/issues/146 + https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1246
