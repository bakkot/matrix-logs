ok, thanks for all 😉

[10:58:39.0982] <Adrian R.>
> <@bkardell:igalia.com> Idk if it were me i would probably follow things merged in the last week in PRs https://github.com/whatwg/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

Thanks for this, I've also been wanting to ask the same question

[11:35:51.0172] <Domenic>
I might be missing something, but I think the list of closed PRs will be almost always worse than https://github.com/whatwg/html/commits/main/ . The commits list has better titles in particular. And it only includes accepted changes.

[11:36:16.0120] <Domenic>
I guess the closed PRs list has labels, which are used a bit inconsistently but might be helpful.


2024-05-02
[00:54:44.0773] <annevk>
Yeah, the commits are definitely more curated than the PRs (and we try to make the log fairly scannable as well), though the PRs have a lot more information if you need additional context.

Just heard from smaug that it's just a remnant of an old meeting, no actual meeting now

[01:04:43.0403] <sideshowbarker>
Aha, thanks

[01:05:16.0040] <smaug>
there is another one way later today (or rather, early tomorrow)

Yeah, the meeting is in 15h - 22min

[01:23:24.0121] <annevk>
(I'll be sleeping through it per usual.)

[07:22:30.0980] <hsivonen>
annevk: Have you noticed https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-emailcore-as-09.html#name-use-and-validation-in-html- and https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-emailcore-as-09.html#name-use-of-addresses-in-top-lev ?

[07:34:40.0058] <annevk>
That's news to me. I'm surprised how it's just a simple description of what HTML does given that J.C. Klensin doesn't appear to like the HTML rules.

[12:00:48.0693] <Jake Archibald>
annevk: do you know off the top of your head how sandboxed data-url workers are? Are they entirely originless?

[12:01:42.0537] <Jake Archibald>
Trying to figure out if it's a safe place to run 3p code. Or if there's a benefit of putting a worker in a sandboxed iframe instead

[16:44:40.0040] <smaug>
jarhar: by any chance, have you checked how often select (size=1) has been used in iframes which are too small to show the whole popup - meaning that in current desktop browsers the popup covers also some of the parent document?

[16:45:23.0256] <smaug>
(I did find some instances of such cases when we were considering to use content processes for select popup rendering)

[16:58:26.0682] <smaug>
(the new select would be of course opt-in)


2024-05-03
[17:14:36.0492] <jarhar>
i dont think we have usecounters for that particular case

[17:15:08.0874] <jarhar>
the new select would be a regular element which gets popover behavior, so it wouldnt escape outside its frame 

[17:16:19.0953] <smaug>
right

[17:20:02.0972] <smaug>
jarhar: does the parser allow anything inside <option> ?

[17:20:25.0276] <smaug>
 * jarhar: does the parser allow all the possible elements inside \<option> ?

[17:21:19.0400] <smaug>
oh, that  would be approach 3

[17:22:09.0924] <jarhar>
my proposal would allow everything in option

[17:23:49.0914] <smaug>
jarhar: hmm, what is the difference between 2 and 3 then? 2 requires use of datalist but 3 wouldn't since one could just use anything inside option?

[17:27:07.0129] <jarhar>
option 2 doesnt relax the parser at all except within button and datalist tags. so the following would be parsed in option 3, but option 2 would continue to throw away the div:
<select>
  <option>
    <div>hello

[17:27:16.0054] <jarhar>
ah the html i wrote is gone

[17:27:58.0051] <jarhar>
select
  option
    div
      text node

[17:28:14.0365] <jarhar>
option 2 would do what the parser currently does here and turn it into this

[17:28:20.0647] <jarhar>
select
option
text node

[17:28:52.0956] <jarhar>
to get the div in option 2 you have to wrap the option in a datalist, which also acts as the popover element

[17:30:21.0400] <smaug>
and still one more question today - before it is getting too late for me. If one doesn't use `<button>` inside `<select>`, what is the expected behavior? Browser would effectively have button as part of internal shadow DOM and that button has then `<selectedoption>` ?

[17:31:36.0258] <jarhar>
yes, but in my current implementation we just copy the text content from the selected option rather than having a full on selectedoption element so we dont have unsanitized content in the ua shadowroot

[17:31:39.0717] <jarhar>
option 2 is implemented in chrome behind experimental web platform features if you want to try it out

[17:32:24.0872] <jarhar>
you just have to add appearance:base-select to the select element to make it render the new stuff

[17:32:59.0511] <smaug>
oh, text content. That is something what was unclear in the explainer, since in one place it is talking about text content and in other place cloning

[17:33:11.0842] <smaug>
"<selectedoption> - The element which contains the text of the currently selected option. Every time that the user selects an option, the browser will replace the text content of this element with the text content of the selected option."

[17:33:29.0274] <smaug>
"The <selectedoption> element enables developers to declaratively clone the content of the selected <option> element to the button and to style it distinctly from the <option>"

[17:34:54.0039] <jarhar>
ah thanks for pointing that out ill fix it right away

[17:35:14.0629] <jarhar>
when the author used the selectedoption element, it clones the node not just the text content

[17:35:24.0382] <jarhar>
*uses

[17:36:41.0782] <smaug>
ok, and that is the reason why https://open-ui.org/components/selectlist/#rich-content-in-options has perhaps a bit surprising behavior. The image isn't part of the selected option.

[17:37:28.0229] <jarhar>
yeah thats because html content doesnt include the selectedoption element

[17:38:18.0193] <jarhar>
if we end up using the not yet implemented sanitizer api to check the content before replacing it, then we can put it in the ua shadowroot by default and youll get the "rich content" without replacing the button

[17:51:37.0191] <smaug>
https://open-ui.org/components/selectlist/#customizing-basic-styles something adds the arrow to the button, but it is not added in https://open-ui.org/components/selectlist/#rendering-the-option-differently-in-the-button 

[22:22:17.0633] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: they use an opaque origin, but both them and sandboxed iframes won't defend you against Spectre attacks in current browser engines

[08:01:02.0337] <jarhar>
thanks, i fixed it by removing the button tag from the example which has a down arrow. the down arrow is inside the button element in the UA shadowroot, so you don't get it when you provide your own button tag.

> <@annevk:matrix.org> That's news to me. I'm surprised how it's just a simple description of what HTML does given that J.C. Klensin doesn't appear to like the HTML rules.

I think it's a description of how WebKit interpreted what HTML says. Arguably, the HTML spec test supports better what Blink does, and to construe the IETF draft concern to cover Blink, one would have to assume it to mean Blink using the transitional mode for `input type=email`. As for the on-issue discussion, so far, I'm failing to steer the discussion to my specific questions about the rules. Evidently, the current spec text isn't clear enough about "the rules", since Blink, Gecko, and WebKit all have different interpretations.

[05:11:42.0258] <hsivonen>
Anyway, it's bad that Hixie didn't write down the rationale for making up non-RFC local-part syntax. My findings from today are: 1) Fastmail front end does not reject consecutive dots but back end refuses to go through with sending. 2) Apple Mail app warns about consecutive dots but allows the user to send anyway. 3) iCloud back end tries to send out consecutive dots. 4) Gmail rejects incoming consecutive dots despite ignoring the dots in mailbox matching for RFC-compliantly-dotted incoming addresses.

[05:13:26.0526] <hsivonen>
Since, Fastmail gets away with refusing to send to addresses with consecutive dots, being able to send to consecutive-dot addresses probably isn't a competitiveness-level mail-compat issue. Since the Apple stack enables sending to addresses with consecutive dots, it's not the case that email software would universally block consecutive dots.

[05:45:03.0967] <annevk>
hsivonen: what I find frustrating is that instead of talking about non-ASCII addresses, we keep getting dragged into discussing the subtleties of the ASCII rules, which impact an even smaller subset of end users. Given that multiple providers reject consecutive dots today I would be somewhat inclined to stick with that, but I could be persuaded I suppose. (I could see how they could lead to spoofing issues of sorts.)

I though that it was relevant to deal with if we're taking the time to change implementations of the local part, but I guess it was unconstructive that I mentioned the dots in my list of questions. Sorry. I skipped that question in my follow-up to your domain-part answers.

Interesting… can you say more? 

[14:22:03.0771] <Richard Gibson>
I think I disagree with this reasoning; the question of "_which element experienced the event?_" is answered not by failing to bubble but by the `target` property. Failing to bubble just makes delegation difficult for generally no good reason (as is the case for e.g. <details> toggle)

Is a use case something like a modal dialog controlled by the URL? It's an interesting idea but I wonder if it's better solved by general declarative solutions (e.g. an initially open modal dialog) or by some declarative URLPattern -> action map separate from invokers?

[15:37:21.0375] <zcorpan>
smaug: maybe CloseWatcher integration is better suited?

[15:41:02.0307] <smaug>
Some URL stuff might work, since that works with session history. And yes, possibly like with dialogs, but also for other (not yet defined) declarative features

[15:43:08.0493] <zcorpan>
smaug: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#close-requests-and-close-watchers

[15:43:23.0734] <zcorpan>
or maybe I don't follow :)

[15:43:58.0729] <smaug>
Not sure that works with random declarative stuff. I want something which can take the page back to some earlier state without any use of JS

[15:49:10.0001] <Luke Warlow>
BFCache does that to some extent. But yeah it'd be interesting to have a way to codify URL -> "app" state

[15:49:45.0243] <Luke Warlow>
Having said that I think the pattern of using URLs for dialogs was partly a result of the lack of a close watcher API.

In say the references section of an article, `<cite><a></a></cite>` feels intuitive to me for some reason, but I do find `<a><cite></cite></a>` perhaps more accurate. The former cites the link, the latter links to the citation.

Could one pattern be more accurate in a certain context, e.g., in the body of an article or references section or elsewhere.

Anyone have thoughts on this or can point me to some discussion?

Note this is not `ReadableStream` implementing async iterable, but right now this is just a spec refactor - it's for being able to pass async iterables to web APIs (initially refactoring `ReadableStream.from`), but then in the future also https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1291

[06:03:11.0454] <Luca Casonato>
The "let an interface implement async iterable" is already in webidl - there was previously just not the reverse ("let a web api take an async iterable as an argument")

Curious if there's any issues/literature I can read about the ability to create a Range selecting part of an input/textarea's value? Right now we have to create a hidden element, copy over the computed styles and create ranges within that.

[14:11:02.0780] <smaug>
keithamus: selecting part of input's value? But that value isn't part of dom so it can't be selected 

[14:15:17.0170] <smaug>
I assume you can't for some reason rely on input.selectionStart/End

[14:34:16.0723] <keithamus>
smaug: predominately we want to get the caret position to place popover menus (like the @ mention autocomplete). We have code to do this but an engineer recently wanted to refresh it and I wondered if there was a web platform solution, or some movement towards one. 

[14:35:29.0477] <smaug>
And for some reason contenteditable isn't an option?

[14:35:30.0203] <keithamus>
A range is useful because we can getBoundingClientRect to get coords to place the popover. 

[14:35:46.0804] <keithamus>
Yes I’d say it’s not an option. 

[14:38:45.0494] <smaug>
(it would be so nice if github didn't take so many of browser internal shortcut keys 😉  Just trying to open devtools to see what the DOM looks like)

[14:39:22.0757] <smaug>
ah, it is really textarea

[14:43:20.0197] <smaug>
I wonder if document itself should have something like getCaretRect(). It would return something reasonable no matter where the caret is - inside some UA widget or designMode or contenteditable

annevk (or whoever): is the process that I should now go file bugs for https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1753 against the various implementations?

[00:04:41.0794] <sideshowbarker>
bakkot: yeah, whatwg spec PR authors are the ones who typically raise the associated browser bugs for their spec PRs — unless somebody else has gotten to it before them

[00:07:54.0957] <bakkot>
ok cool

[00:08:20.0756] <sideshowbarker>
by the way, about the tests at https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/46198, isn’t an IDL test also needed?

I guess I'll open the PRs for adding this method to Blob and PushMessageData also before filing

[00:11:46.0820] <sideshowbarker>
after changes get merged into the spec, those get automatically updated — but not for PRs

[00:12:04.0190] <sideshowbarker>
but maybe it’s not needed for PRs, I dunno

[00:12:28.0419] <bakkot>
yeah the readme/files claim the things in that directory are generated

right — they eventually get overwritten eventually at least

[00:14:00.0211] <sideshowbarker>

Yeah, the bot will update the idl test once the spec is actually updated, so no manual work necessary

> <@smaug:mozilla.org> I wonder if document itself should have something like getCaretRect(). It would return something reasonable no matter where the caret is - inside some UA widget or designMode or contenteditable

getCaretRect() sounds super helpful! Would solve a lot of issues we have!

[05:54:34.0642] <Ms2ger>
So you can do `(new Int32Array(10))[2]`, but I keep overlooking where the spec for this is. Does anyone have a pointer?

[06:14:33.0943] <arai>
is it about whether to treat the `Int32Array` constructor arguments as length or not?  if so, https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-typedarray step 6.b vs 6.c

[06:59:48.0286] <Ms2ger>
No, the `[2]` indexing - sorry for the confusion

[07:14:07.0174] <arai>
then it's https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-typedarray-exotic-objects

[07:21:44.0399] <Ms2ger>
Thanks! I kept looking in Indexed Collections and not finding anything

https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10328 - does this need specific gecko approval or does their positive trusted types position count as enough?

I can't answer the question whether the standards position is enough, but I can say that enforcing TT for document.write/ln is fine with me :-)

annevk: did you see https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9841#issuecomment-2100393217? The PR meets the requirements for merging, but I'd like to avoid a messy situation if you strongly disagree with the name and that delays support in WebKit.

I've found nothing that does anything with the "download" value for request initiator: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#downloading-resources:concept-request-initiator - annevk do you know why it exists?

zcorpan: maybe look at blame for Fetch? I think it was CSP, but thinking around download has evolved so maybe it's no-op code... (It should really be a property of navigation.)

[04:46:51.0891] <zcorpan>
annevk: ok. Clicking <a download href> doesn't go through the navigate algorithm per spec

Can anybody think of an existing implemented WebIDL interface that has no members?

[19:02:14.0768] <sideshowbarker>
I’m aware of the `FragmentDirective` interface from the scroll-to-text-fragment spec https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/#feature-detectability and I’ve been trying to figure out how to implement it from the C++ side — and have been failing so far. So it would help if there were some existing no-members IDL interface that’s been implemented, and I could look at the corresponding C++ source.

[00:51:02.0444] <zcorpan>
sideshowbarker: HTMLUnknownElement (though it inherits from HTMLElement)

[00:56:08.0432] <zcorpan>
sideshowbarker: CDATASection

[00:58:25.0062] <sideshowbarker>
ah yeah I had looked at some corresponding C++ source for that, and in that case also, it inherits (from Text)

[00:59:15.0786] <sideshowbarker>
this FragmentDirective thing is a really odd case — an interface that exposes nothing, and inherits from nothing

[01:00:27.0571] <sideshowbarker>
apparently it only exists for the purpose of feature detection, and for possible future use for other things

Any examples of how specs turn floats into integers?
I'm specifying a thing (https://github.com/WICG/responsive-image-client-hints/issues/34) where Chrome currently implements ceil(), though arguably the use case would be slightly better served by round(), although it doesn't really matter... mostly want to specify it in a precise way that isn't "do the equivalent of Javascript’s Math.ceil()"

Any clues as to why JS bindings-generation code would try to generate a callable function for something defined in IDL as an attribute?

Specifically, if I’ve updated `Document.idl` to add this:

```webidl
 [SameObject] readonly attribute FragmentDirective fragmentDirective;
```

And in some corresponding C++ sources, for `Document.h`, I’ve just done this:

```
 FragmentDirective xfragmentDirective;
```
Then the bindings generator appears to be trying to do this:

```
RELEASE_AND_RETURN(throwScope, (toJS<IDLInterface<FragmentDirective>>(lexicalGlobalObject, *thisObject.globalObject(), throwScope, impl.fragmentDirective())));
```
And I realize that different bindings generators for different engines might do some different things — but I’d assume they should be doing basically the same thing (e.g., in this case, they’d all for some reason try to generate a callable `fragmentDirective()`).

[06:03:29.0450] <Domenic>
That looks to me like it's trying to call a C++ fragmentDirective() function. So to implement the getter for the fragmentDirective JavaScript property, you'd implement a C++ fragmentDirective() function. No real contradiction there.

[06:50:43.0655] <emilio>
sideshowbarker: Domenic is correct. Since JS attributes can generally run arbitrary code it is easier to generate code that calls a function unconditionally even when it's just a plain member or what not
