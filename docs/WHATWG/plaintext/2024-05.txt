ok, thanks for all ðŸ˜‰

> <@bkardell:igalia.com> Idk if it were me i would probably follow things merged in the last week in PRs https://github.com/whatwg/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

Thanks for this, I've also been wanting to ask the same question

[11:35:51.0172] <Domenic>
I might be missing something, but I think the list of closed PRs will be almost always worse than https://github.com/whatwg/html/commits/main/ . The commits list has better titles in particular. And it only includes accepted changes.

[11:36:16.0120] <Domenic>
I guess the closed PRs list has labels, which are used a bit inconsistently but might be helpful.

Yeah, the commits are definitely more curated than the PRs (and we try to make the log fairly scannable as well), though the PRs have a lot more information if you need additional context.

Just heard from smaug that it's just a remnant of an old meeting, no actual meeting now

[01:04:43.0403] <sideshowbarker>
Aha, thanks

[01:05:16.0040] <smaug>
there is another one way later today (or rather, early tomorrow)

[01:22:58.0784] <annevk>
Yeah, the meeting is in 15h - 22min

[01:23:24.0121] <annevk>
(I'll be sleeping through it per usual.)
