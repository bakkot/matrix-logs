ok, thanks for all ðŸ˜‰

> <@bkardell:igalia.com> Idk if it were me i would probably follow things merged in the last week in PRs https://github.com/whatwg/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

Thanks for this, I've also been wanting to ask the same question

[11:35:51.0172] <Domenic>
I might be missing something, but I think the list of closed PRs will be almost always worse than https://github.com/whatwg/html/commits/main/ . The commits list has better titles in particular. And it only includes accepted changes.

[11:36:16.0120] <Domenic>
I guess the closed PRs list has labels, which are used a bit inconsistently but might be helpful.

Yeah, the commits are definitely more curated than the PRs (and we try to make the log fairly scannable as well), though the PRs have a lot more information if you need additional context.

Video link for the triage meeting?

Just heard from smaug that it's just a remnant of an old meeting, no actual meeting now

[01:04:43.0403] <sideshowbarker>
Aha, thanks

[01:05:16.0040] <smaug>
there is another one way later today (or rather, early tomorrow)

[01:05:45.0720] <smaug>
 * there is another meeting way later today (or rather, early tomorrow)

[01:22:58.0784] <annevk>
Yeah, the meeting is in 15h - 22min

[01:23:24.0121] <annevk>
(I'll be sleeping through it per usual.)

annevk: Have you noticed https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-emailcore-as-09.html#name-use-and-validation-in-html- and https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-emailcore-as-09.html#name-use-of-addresses-in-top-lev ?

[07:34:40.0058] <annevk>
That's news to me. I'm surprised how it's just a simple description of what HTML does given that J.C. Klensin doesn't appear to like the HTML rules.

annevk: do you know off the top of your head how sandboxed data-url workers are? Are they entirely originless?

[12:01:42.0537] <Jake Archibald>
Trying to figure out if it's a safe place to run 3p code. Or if there's a benefit of putting a worker in a sandboxed iframe instead

jarhar: by any chance, have you checked how often select (size=1) has been used in iframes which are too small to show the whole popup - meaning that in current desktop browsers the popup covers also some of the parent document?

[16:45:23.0256] <smaug>
(I did find some instances of such cases when we were considering to use content processes for select popup rendering)
