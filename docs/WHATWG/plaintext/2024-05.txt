> <@bkardell:igalia.com> Idk if it were me i would probably follow things merged in the last week in PRs https://github.com/whatwg/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

Thanks for this, I've also been wanting to ask the same question

I might be missing something, but I think the list of closed PRs will be almost always worse than https://github.com/whatwg/html/commits/main/ . The commits list has better titles in particular. And it only includes accepted changes.

I guess the closed PRs list has labels, which are used a bit inconsistently but might be helpful.
