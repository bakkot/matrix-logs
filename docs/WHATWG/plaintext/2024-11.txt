Anyone understands what "If these attributes are omitted from an element, then the language of this element is the same as the language of its parent element, if any (except for slot elements in a shadow tree)." in the spec means? slot elements are somehow special cased, but it doesn't explain how?

That language is not for implementers. Maybe it got out of sync with the implementer requirements?

As for `moveBefore()` and focus, I thought we decided not to do that? Did something change?

Ryosuke brought this up originally and it was left open, I suggested an additional alternative here that I think satisfies all the cases.

Noam Rosenthal: I don't get the impression he feels strongly about it. One point that was raised is that `moveBefore()` won't be state-preserving for accessibility as layout will be impacted.
