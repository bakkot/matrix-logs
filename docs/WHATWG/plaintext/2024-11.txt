Anyone understands what "If these attributes are omitted from an element, then the language of this element is the same as the language of its parent element, if any (except for slot elements in a shadow tree)." in the spec means? slot elements are somehow special cased, but it doesn't explain how?

That language is not for implementers. Maybe it got out of sync with the implementer requirements?

As for `moveBefore()` and focus, I thought we decided not to do that? Did something change?
