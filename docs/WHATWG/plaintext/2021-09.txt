https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/8515 could just some quick help. Basically just needs a comment in response to the OP‚Äôs question. Should only take ~10 minutes.

[10:17:40.0459] <annevk>
Domenic: thoughts on where we should put a Security/Privacy section? First no-num section? Also, in DOM, should the Historical section become a no-num section? See https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1013 for context. (I'm out now, but I figured I'd leave this here and maybe address it tomorrow. Thoughts from others welcome as well of course.)

[10:19:52.0634] <Domenic>
annevk: no real opinion, besides that it seems a bit weird that W3C process/groups is influencing our editorial style. I guess I would lean toward leaving it numbered since it is not shared boilerplate that all specs are expected to have? Or is it?

[10:25:23.0114] <annevk>
Domenic: I guess it kinda is shared, in the sense that a reviewer can access the impact, but the contents would be specific to the document. I'm not quite sure how I feel about it yet and I'm not really volunteering on adding the complicated sections, e.g., to HTML.

[10:48:30.0726] <Domenic>
Yeah this seems like a "PR welcome" situation at the most.

[10:55:08.0150] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
Step 4.7. here https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#updating-the-source-set says: 

"Parse child's sizes attribute with the fallback width _width_, and let source set's source size be the returned value."

I don't see _width_ defined anywhere, or fallback width used anywhere in the "Parse a sizes attribute" algorithm.

Ten bucks says I'm just missing something, though. cc: zcorpan

[01:51:31.0970] <annevk>
jgraham: for Test Utils, the Workstream is now approved. https://github.com/whatwg/meta/blob/main/NEW-STANDARD.md has a checklist. Is there an existing repo that will be moved or do you need a new one? When do you want to work on this?

[01:56:14.0234] <sideshowbarker>
hsivonen: the only remaining big thing about making the standalone Java version of parser spec-conforming is the encoding stuff ‚Äî¬†as discussed in https://github.com/validator/htmlparser/pull/48. As mentioned at https://github.com/validator/htmlparser/pull/48#issuecomment-691654072 I‚Äôd thought that could be addressed by merging in the changes from the `encodings` branch. But since that branch is now gone, I guess the changes there were never intended to end being released anyway?

[01:57:23.0620] <hsivonen>
The encoding stuff was _intenteded_ to be released, but when it became clear it wasn't progressing to a releaseable state, I stashed it away.

[01:57:31.0459] <sideshowbarker>
OK

[01:57:47.0269] <hsivonen>
 * The encoding stuff was _intented_ to be released, but when it became clear it wasn't progressing to a releaseable state, I stashed it away.

[01:57:57.0594] <hsivonen>
 * The encoding stuff was _intended_ to be released, but when it became clear it wasn't progressing to a releaseable state, I stashed it away.

[01:59:05.0366] <sideshowbarker>
well since without those encoding changes the Java parser doesn‚Äôt pass the html5lib encoding tests, I can‚Äôt recall now how I made CI pass without them. I assume I must just somehow have it skipping those tests.

[01:59:32.0897] <hsivonen>
The html5lib tests just test the labels and not the encoding tables, right?

[01:59:46.0770] <hsivonen>
You did land spec-compliant labels, IIRC.

[02:00:09.0836] <sideshowbarker>
OK maybe I just need to quit fretting about it

[02:01:59.0566] <sideshowbarker>
I just vaguely recall that we still have some significant failures when running some of the html5lib encoding tests ‚Äî maybe some that we have to flip on some non-default things to actually enable testing for, I dunno

[02:02:12.0163] <sideshowbarker>
I guess should just go back and look at my code and see

[02:04:40.0414] <sideshowbarker>
ideally it would just seem nice to be able to assert ‚Äúthis is a fully spec-conforming parser‚Äù with confidence ‚Äî and document it with passing tests

[02:05:10.0195] <sideshowbarker>
but the existence of https://github.com/validator/htmlparser/pull/48 makes me think we can‚Äôt actually do that yet

[02:06:47.0331] <sideshowbarker>
(all the encoding stuff really bewilders me ‚Äî even after I were to look back at the code, I think it would take me quite a bit of time to get back again to whatever marginal understanding of it I managed to arrive at when I‚Äôd hacked on it previously)

[02:08:22.0240] <sideshowbarker>
anyway, hsivonen and annevk in other news: I remember previously being subscribed to a Mozilla mailing list where, when there was some W3C spec transition or charter out for AC review, dbaron would post FYI messages asking if anybody wanted to send comments or objections as part of the review

[02:09:25.0237] <sideshowbarker>
but I either no longer seem to be on that list ‚Äî or else no such FYI-about-AC-review messages are going out any longer to whatever list that is

[02:09:56.0399] <hsivonen>
The list is dev-platform. Not sure if Tantek has systematically posted such messages or not.

[02:10:42.0811] <sideshowbarker>
ah OK thanks ‚Äî I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm still subscribed to dev-platform and getting messages from it

[02:11:51.0415] <hsivonen>
(encoding_rs has some nice properties that logically make it nicely compilable to efficient Java byte code. Sadly, related tools are too general instead of being customized to those nice properties.)

[02:12:29.0759] <hsivonen>
(The nice properties being: Reading and writing from caller-provided arrays, static read-only arrays and otherwise allocating only on the stack.)

[02:14:36.0269] <sideshowbarker>
wow well I would really love to have a good reason to work on Rust sources for a change, rather than doing all in Java

[02:15:47.0267] <hsivonen>
I think the the approach that wouldn't involve the yak shave of a custom compiler would be compiling to asm.js and then cleaning that up manually as Java as a one-time operation.

[02:16:04.0097] <hsivonen>
Still might be easier to write Java manually from the spec.

[02:16:53.0015] <hsivonen>
The main problem with compiling to wasm and then converting wasm to Java byte code is the loss of Java `char` arrays as Rust `u16` arrays.

[02:18:10.0173] <hsivonen>
Or, rather, Rust `u16` slices.

annevk: https://github.com/jgraham/browser-test/ is the existing repo

[02:20:54.0097] <jgraham>
I strongly advise against getting me to make an icon :)

[02:31:57.0809] <annevk>
jgraham: it's the best part :-)

[02:50:55.0731] <jgraham>
Many years ago I had a simple Firefox extension and I got some feedback asking for a toolbar button. Afterwards I got feedback complaining I'd let a toddler design the icon.

[04:24:00.0845] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
Did you?

[05:25:00.0131] <jgraham>
Yes?

[05:27:06.0253] <jgraham>
Dunno how one would find it now given it previously probably worked with Firefox 3 or something

[06:02:54.0101] <annevk>
Domenic: so when I run make deploy I get a .spec.whatwg.org directory rather than a SHORTNAME.spec.whatwg.org directory and I don't really understand why

[06:03:23.0076] <annevk>
Domenic: maybe it's a macOS thing that sed -n 's#.*/\([^.]*\)\(\.git\)\?#\1#p' ends up returning the empty string for the given input

[06:03:34.0036] <annevk>
/me vaguely recalls some issues with macOS and sed

[06:03:47.0663] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
I get the right directory name on Linux, if that's worth for anything

[06:04:38.0832] <annevk>
Thanks, I guess that means I ought to look into it being a macOS thing and perhaps copy-and-paste something from the previous solution

[06:11:18.0710] <freddy>
maybe there are different `sed`s and you can install gnu-sed?

[06:13:27.0355] <annevk>
I'd rather not require that for these kind of scripts, although in practice I wonder how many people end up running make deploy or equivalent

[06:56:37.0950] <stephanluis>
Hi everyone!

[07:03:06.0671] <stephanluis>
Was wondering the history behind a html5 tag <input type='duration'> for periods of time which don't require time localisation.  For example if I build a countdown clock that allows users to input a start time, HTML5 has no input type that will have the great functionality of the input-time but not be affected by local time formatting.  The situation seems odd, why is there not a control to input hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds especially since these units are used around the world?

[07:05:44.0764] <Domenic>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> I'd rather not require that for these kind of scripts, although in practice I wonder how many people end up running make deploy or equivalent

Yeah, fixing it to work on Macs would probably be worthwhile.

[07:08:16.0543] <jgraham>
> <@ms2ger:igalia.com> Did you?

Oh, I just reparsed this. I let someone whose graphic design skills hadn't improved noticably since being a toddler (i.e. me) create it.

[07:17:21.0653] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
hs-ivonen taught me reparsing is bad

Andreu Botella (he/they): Domenic: does `git config --local remote.origin.url | sed 's/.*\///' | sed 's/.git//'` work for you?

[07:54:07.0906] <Domenic>
Yes

[08:03:07.0053] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
Same here

[08:16:52.0523] <annevk>
Thanks, I'll send a PR

[08:23:57.0481] <annevk>
stephanluis: in theory you can control localization through the `lang` attribute, but I'm aware of implementations

[08:32:37.0714] <stephanluis>
Yes, I've looked into that and it's too unreliable.  Additionally my specific implementation is a JS plugin, so don't want to update the language for the user's page.  Why isn't a duration type input part of the spec?  It seems universally useful.   

[08:34:25.0831] <annevk>
I'm somewhat surprised by the renewed relevance of the The Unpaired Surrogates and Lone Surrogates band names. Maybe it's time to start playing an instrument.

[08:36:19.0686] <annevk>
stephanluis: I don't recall. Perhaps it was discussed, but you'd have to go back pretty far in the archives. Most of the "new" input types were added in 2006 if I remember correctly.

[08:36:55.0433] <annevk>
https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/ / https://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/

[08:37:35.0008] <stephanluis>
Wow!  And the process for amending the spec to include a new input type?

[08:37:59.0872] <annevk>
Oh, no, they were added in 2004 in Web Forms 2.0 (private draft end of 2003 I think), implemented in 2006 by Opera.

[08:38:18.0696] <annevk>
stephanluis: https://whatwg.org/working-mode#changes and https://whatwg.org/faq#adding-new-features

[08:39:38.0355] <stephanluis>
If I were to look back through the archive what reasons for not including duration would preclude it from being later accepted?

[08:52:43.0822] <stephanluis>
This duration input is such a generic idea it's hard to imagine why it's not an exposable base class to input time?   

[08:56:49.0635] <stephanluis>
... in most browser implementations.

[09:08:23.0752] <annevk>
I think at this point it would probably be judged based on need, amount of workarounds people deploy for it, etc. You might also want to look at the Open UI effort to see if they are tackling it.

[09:08:46.0219] <annevk>
The archives could be useful for understanding why it didn't happen back then, if it was even suggested.

[09:13:08.0352] <stephanluis>
are these the people https://open-ui.org/ ? 

[09:18:40.0947] <annevk>
Yeah, that looks correct

[09:20:42.0866] <stephanluis>
To me it's weird, but not many people seem to think they require this control but seem put up with converting from strings or multiple text boxes to separate units.  To me it seems like a glaring omission.  Writing a polyfill doesn't seem to be the correct approach?  What would you recommend?   

[09:22:00.0693] <stephanluis>
(I'll be away from my console for a couple hours, can resume the conversation later.)  Thanks for your guidance !

[23:28:07.0565] <sideshowbarker>

[23:33:01.0278] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: text/plain; application/json isn't actually the evil example, https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/838 has the worse attacks

[23:33:42.0171] <sideshowbarker>

[23:33:57.0453] <annevk>
The only complete solution here would be for the browser to take ownership of setting Content-Type, but I think that ends up breaking things, but it could be tried again I suppose

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> The only complete solution here would be for the browser to take ownership of setting Content-Type, but I think that ends up breaking things, but it could be tried again I suppose

Well, short of that, would another solution be, just for the case of JSON request bodies, for the browser to refuse to allow the Content-Type request header to be set to a non-JSON media type?

[23:37:48.0324] <sideshowbarker>
‚Ä¶like CORB but from the client side ‚Äî for requests rather than responses

[23:38:08.0602] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: we cannot tell the type of a body

[23:38:15.0471] <sideshowbarker>
ah OK

[23:39:10.0996] <annevk>
I guess we could try to parse all bodies to see if they are JSON, but I'm pretty sure rejecting those would break the web at this point

[23:39:49.0979] <sideshowbarker>
yeah, parsing the bodies is what I had in mind, and yeah I think it would definitely break a lot people‚Äôs stuff

[23:40:41.0510] <sideshowbarker>
e.g., it would break requests to the Slack API from frontend code, as in that https://stackoverflow.com/a/45752919/441757 case

[01:22:37.0568] <freddy>
annevk:  in a URL, how would you call a hostname that does not contain any dots? bare hostname? non-dotted hostname? I was looking for "prior" art in our UriFixup files and the whatwg url spec, but found none.

[01:27:45.0978] <annevk>
freddy: maybe a single-label domain, but we don't have solid terminology at that level

[01:28:17.0307] <annevk>

I'd like to keep all the functionality of the time input, but make all browsers use a 24h clock so that can be used as a twenty-four hour duration input.

[03:02:30.0420] <stephanluis>
https://dan503.github.io/time-input-polyfill/ initially looked more promising, but ran into problems with that too.  Can't remember exactly what it was, looked at it a while ago.   

[03:04:27.0978] <stephanluis>

Having had another look at the Time Input Polyfill I may be able to start with that.  Will keep you updated.  Still feel that duration input should probably be in the standard as it's the 'universal'/ not region or language dependant  part of a time input !

sideshowbarker: is `#css` on `irc.w3.org` still a thing or has that channel been bridged to somewhere else? (have some questions about how CSS modules being imported to JS should behave)

[15:34:42.0902] <DerekNonGeneric>
/cc maybe TabAtkins where do my CSS questions go? üòÑ

[15:35:23.0099] <TabAtkins>
The W3C still operates its chat rooms, feel free to ask there

[15:35:48.0349] <TabAtkins>
sideshowbarker: Nope, that's what I meant. ^_^

[15:37:50.0493] <DerekNonGeneric>
cool, my question is there -- hope it doesn't seem obnoxious, but aside from MIME types, not sure what else JS is expected to do w/ an imported CSS file

[15:41:09.0026] <DerekNonGeneric>
(even JS has no idea about MIME types, but what should be asserted is confusing me)

[16:24:50.0649] <GPHemsley>
are there any Edge developers in here?

#_w3c_#css:matrix.org should work (Matrix bridge to #css on irc.w3.org) ‚Äî¬†but Element seems to have some problem with actually exposing it

Looking at the #css channel in my IRC client, I can see that Matrix did actually let me join it. But for some reason Element just doesn‚Äôt load as a room.

[18:33:12.0690] <DerekNonGeneric>
connecting to it from my IRC client seems legit lol

[18:35:14.0352] <DerekNonGeneric>
so far all the Matrix clients (except the Element web app seem too far behind on the whole Spaces concept to be worth the bother for me)

CSS module scripts are standardized in HTML, not in CSS. The idea is that you can append whatever you imported to a style sheet set. For instance, a style sheet set belonging to a shadow root.

Excellent ‚Äî laissez les bons temps rouler

annevk: Ok. already back with the first example of where javascript will not be sufficient for modifying the time input to become a duration input.  The hurdle is that Safari adds AM or PM and converts to a 12hr clock.  While the 12hr conversion is straightforward to deal with -- for a timer up to 12 hours, removing the AM/PM with css updates is unreliable as this seems the only way to approach it  ::-webkit-datetime-edit-ampm-field { display: none;}  .  AM/PM is still displaying in my tests. I'm doubting that js/css can be used for a duration input polyfill .

stephanluis: a quick search yields https://nadchif.github.io/html-duration-picker.js/

[03:21:39.0992] <stephanluis>
I've looked at that it doesn't maintain the time input functionality, on the demo you can see additional buttons are required.
