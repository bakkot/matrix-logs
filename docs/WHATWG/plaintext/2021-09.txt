https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/8515 could just some quick help. Basically just needs a comment in response to the OP’s question. Should only take ~10 minutes.

Domenic: thoughts on where we should put a Security/Privacy section? First no-num section? Also, in DOM, should the Historical section become a no-num section? See https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1013 for context. (I'm out now, but I figured I'd leave this here and maybe address it tomorrow. Thoughts from others welcome as well of course.)

annevk: no real opinion, besides that it seems a bit weird that W3C process/groups is influencing our editorial style. I guess I would lean toward leaving it numbered since it is not shared boilerplate that all specs are expected to have? Or is it?

Domenic: I guess it kinda is shared, in the sense that a reviewer can access the impact, but the contents would be specific to the document. I'm not quite sure how I feel about it yet and I'm not really volunteering on adding the complicated sections, e.g., to HTML.

Yeah this seems like a "PR welcome" situation at the most.

Step 4.7. here https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#updating-the-source-set says: 

"Parse child's sizes attribute with the fallback width _width_, and let source set's source size be the returned value."

I don't see _width_ defined anywhere, or fallback width used anywhere in the "Parse a sizes attribute" algorithm.

Ten bucks says I'm just missing something, though. cc: zcorpan

yipes *“No server is currently available to service your request.”* from GitHub

big AWS failure affecting many sites maybe?

[19:04:01.0387] <sideshowbarker>
ah, maybe just Japan

foolip: you around? Does https://github.com/whatwg/sg/pull/160#pullrequestreview-744777669 seem reasonable?

hsivonen: reviewing and testing and merging the ambiguous-ampersand patch took me a bit longer than I had anticipated, but with it landed now, I’m super glad — no more need for a separate branch of the parser for the HTML checker, and now we have CI working (so we can catch regressions later, etc.)
