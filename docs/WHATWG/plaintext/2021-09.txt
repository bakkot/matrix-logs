https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/8515 could just some quick help. Basically just needs a comment in response to the OPâ€™s question. Should only take ~10 minutes.

Domenic: thoughts on where we should put a Security/Privacy section? First no-num section? Also, in DOM, should the Historical section become a no-num section? See https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1013 for context. (I'm out now, but I figured I'd leave this here and maybe address it tomorrow. Thoughts from others welcome as well of course.)

annevk: no real opinion, besides that it seems a bit weird that W3C process/groups is influencing our editorial style. I guess I would lean toward leaving it numbered since it is not shared boilerplate that all specs are expected to have? Or is it?
