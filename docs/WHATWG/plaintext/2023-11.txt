To clarify, the conclusion is that CustomStateSet _shouldnt_ validate, and should allow setting states that are not valid productions within the CSS?

keithamus: As I tried to explain, it's not that straightforward. The API doesn't take a CSS identifier. It just takes a string. So the API accepts "1", but you can only match that in CSS writing "\31". And so yeah, no validation would be the same as `getElementById()` and seems like reasonable behavior.

Thanks for the clarification annevk. Your explanation has been sufficient, I just wanted to double check so I can remove the checks in the PRs I'm making ðŸ˜„

keithamus: ooh, you're implementing this? Cool cool cool.

I should have clarified my motivation for querying, it may have helped. But yes https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D191988#inline-1067489 and a very much WIP https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/compare/main...keithamus:WebKit:custom-state-set

I have a question regarding `<main>` and `<article>`

[05:46:03.0808] <bilal adnan>
Let's say I have a blog article page. Should the main content be labeled with `<main>` or `<article>`? I personally feel `<main>` is a better choice but I am confused in one thing.

<main> can't be nested inside any <article> element, as per the WHATWG HTML standard, to be **hierarchically correct**. But because the main content of the article should go in <main>, why would anyone want to use <article> for the main content of the article. I guess the HTML standard showcases such an example.

`<main>` can't be nested inside any \<article> element, as per the WHATWG HTML standard, to be **hierarchically correct**. But because the main content of the article should go in `<main>`, why would anyone want to use `<article>` for the main content of the article. I guess the HTML standard showcases such an example.
