To clarify, the conclusion is that CustomStateSet _shouldnt_ validate, and should allow setting states that are not valid productions within the CSS?

keithamus: As I tried to explain, it's not that straightforward. The API doesn't take a CSS identifier. It just takes a string. So the API accepts "1", but you can only match that in CSS writing "\31". And so yeah, no validation would be the same as `getElementById()` and seems like reasonable behavior.
