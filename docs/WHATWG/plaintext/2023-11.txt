To clarify, the conclusion is that CustomStateSet _shouldnt_ validate, and should allow setting states that are not valid productions within the CSS?

[06:19:43.0943] <annevk>
keithamus: As I tried to explain, it's not that straightforward. The API doesn't take a CSS identifier. It just takes a string. So the API accepts "1", but you can only match that in CSS writing "\31". And so yeah, no validation would be the same as `getElementById()` and seems like reasonable behavior.

I have a question regarding `<main>` and `<article>`

[05:46:03.0808] <bilal adnan>
Let's say I have a blog article page. Should the main content be labeled with `<main>` or `<article>`? I personally feel `<main>` is a better choice but I am confused in one thing.

<main> can't be nested inside any <article> element, as per the WHATWG HTML standard, to be **hierarchically correct**. But because the main content of the article should go in <main>, why would anyone want to use <article> for the main content of the article. I guess the HTML standard showcases such an example.

> <@annevk:matrix.org> sideshowbarker: sorry, I didn't realize lang-related changes around `slot` were also being reverted

No worries ‚Äî it gave me a chance to go in and read through the spec PRs and related issue comments, and to figure out what it looked like in some actual code. So it was some good learning for me, and I reckon what I learned from it is very likely to be useful for me with some other patch later

[15:34:18.0458] <sideshowbarker>
So I‚Äôm looking at the test at https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/LayoutTests/http/tests/security/xss-DENIED-script-inject-into-inactive-window2.html#L42 and trying to figure out some way to detect that the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù content has loaded ‚Äî other than by checking `location.href`

What that tests does is this:
1. Creates an `a` link
2. Sets the link‚Äôs `target` to `_blank`
3. Sets the link‚Äôs `rel` value to opener
4. Sets the link‚Äôs `href` to `?actually-attack`
5. Clicks the link (with `link.click()`)

The, after the navigation to `?actually-attack` happens:

1. Creates another `a` link
2. Sets the link‚Äôs `target` to `_self`
3. Sets the link‚Äôs `href` to `http://localhost:8000/security/resources/innocent-victim.html`
4. Clicks the link (with `link.click()`)

So I want to figure out a way to detect when the `http://localhost:8000/security/resources/innocent-victim.html` content has loaded.

[16:19:51.0739] <TabAtkins>

TabAtkins: they are code points, just all of them are ASCII :-)

[16:20:46.0306] <TabAtkins>

Why have you chosen not to include the :fullscreen CSS pseudo-class among other CSS pseudo-classes in this link https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#pseudo-classes, despite dedicating a page to the fullscreen API here https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/?

[05:44:49.0817] <annevk>
chargeitall: it's defined in https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/#:fullscreen-pseudo-class already, no need to define it twice

[05:46:46.0639] <chargeitall>
Would you omit :checked from the html multipage if it had its own page?

[06:11:01.0943] <chargeitall>
I am inquiring about excluding the :fullscreen pseudo-class from being listed next to other CSS pseudo-classes. It could be listed with a brief description, and the user can click for a more in-depth understanding. Is there another reason for excluding it as there are excluded CSS pseudo-classes e.g. :first-child or :current that were not defined as the case with the Fullscreen API.

[06:19:02.0215] <annevk>
Some pseudo-classes don't require a definition in the host language as they're host-agnostic, though CSS isn't great about differentiating between the two kinds.

[07:36:29.0984] <chargeitall>
The WHATWG focuses on various technologies that are essential components of the web platform. Is this why there is no specific CSS standard? Does this imply that if I want to discover a new CSS feature, I should depend on W3C/CSSWG instead of WHATWG? like the ones in the Candidate Recommendation TRs?

[07:40:49.0052] <annevk>
chargeitall: the web platform is made up of a variety of standards created by a variety of standards organizations. Depending on where your interests lie, you may have to pay attention to WHATWG, Unicode, W3C (includes the CSS WG), Ecma (TC39 in particular), CA/Browser Forum, Khronos, AOM, etc.

Thank you. I resolved the non-structural comments. As for the HTTP fetch vs HTTP-network fetch, I did misunderstand your previous comments (thought you were referring to why were modifying Main fetch). It looks like I can move the fallback handling to somewhere before step 23 of network-or-cache fetch (that is, before any cache handling is done). I'll look into doing that, if that makes sense.

[23:55:48.0387] <annevk>
meacer: in that case you can probably put it directly in HTTP-network fetch?

[00:01:19.0534] <annevk>
meacer: because the early cache lookup in 25 is very specific and I don't think ends up applying here

Great to see such speedy reviews and patch feedback loops on HTTPS Upgrades.  I'm curious about the answers to my questions about a) redirects and b) IP addresses in the hostname

[00:45:49.0667] <annevk>
So if we do this in HTTP-network fetch it would be way before redirects are handled. Not sure if that answers your question or not.

Redirects? :)

[09:27:35.0690] <meacer>
freddy: Sorry, I wasn't ignoring your comments, just wanted to ask the team about the IP addresses first  :) We had a "non-unique hostnames" exception in the first draft (e.g. site.test etc) which presumably covered IP addresses. But it might be a good idea to spell out IP addresses explicitly.

[09:28:18.0972] <meacer>
As for the tests, I have an additional SW related WPT that I'll land for this.

[09:33:21.0357] <meacer>
Could probably write one for redirects as well

referencing <https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9920> is it the case that all 3 major engines use separate processes for Shared/ServiceWorkers but keep DedicatedWorkers in the same process as the renderer, just in different threads? 

[20:59:35.0458] <akaster>
I was hoping to start implementing DedicatedWorkers in Ladybird assuming that any worker type would "always" have its own process (until there's too many processes and we have to start sharing etc etc). Which would mean we can keep covering our ears and pretend that the thread-unsafety of LibWeb/LibJS can wait until 'later' still. 

[21:01:31.0915] <akaster>
Per the issue, Domenic:  was saying his understanding was that that's not a good idea because of the requirements for SharedArrayBuffers in the ECMAScript spec.

Correct, I think. At least definitely correct for dedicated workers in same process; not sure if shared and service are process-isolated everywhere.

[21:06:23.0963] <akaster>
Hmm all right.. well, we'll have to handle distinct realms existing in the same process to handle window.open, so handling separate agents (called VM, in our implementation) is probably not going to be too far from that. I'm mostly worried about the places where we still reach out to the "main thread VM" Singleton.. would be nice to always know which agent we're working with though.

[21:54:07.0919] <Domenic>
same-origin window.open, but also same-origin iframes

I guided someone to follow the "new feature" template a bit more closely and https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1233 is quite understandable now in terms of what it's trying to achieve. Hopefully it continues to work that well.

[23:45:36.0897] <Jake Archibald>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> Jake Archibald: methods generally throw, setters generally ignore (and then the getter continues to return the same value); this is somewhat enforced for enums

So things like `valueAsDate` throwing on, say, a range input, is that breaking convention, or is it correct by some other rule?

[23:46:46.0406] <Jake Archibald>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#dom-input-valueasdate

[23:50:37.0921] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: I think `valueAsDate` is breaking several conventions; doesn't it return a new object each time you invoke the getter?

[23:51:05.0832] <Jake Archibald>
Ohh that's a good point

[23:51:30.0848] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: having said that, I guess I'm not entirely sure about what the convention is for non-enums, but I wouldn't base precedent on `valueAsDate`.

[00:19:33.0584] <Domenic>
I'm not sure setters ignoring is really best practice, but I admit not thinking too hard about it...

[00:19:50.0790] <Domenic>
In JS itself there are some cases where setters throw in strict mode and ignore in sloppy mode, IIRC.

Probably, as long as we had the same sort of abstraction layer for turning raw JS functions into this new thing. (Which I am not sure I would otherwise add... although maybe, I dunno.)

[02:15:56.0227] <annevk>
Domenic: well that could also be the overload, provided Web IDL gets support for that

[02:16:44.0625] <annevk>
Domenic: but thanks, that confirms my suspicion that these patterns are in fact identical

[02:17:32.0735] <Domenic>
It's a bit tricky because it seems like the use cases are:

- Streams: need to grab a property eagerly, need to grab methods to call later
- Custom elements: needs to be a constructor, need  to grab properties eagerly, need to grab its *prototype* methods to call later
- EventListener: need to grab a single method eagerly, or convert an incoming JS function into a wrapper around that method. Only one function/method so it's kind of nicer if you don't have to specify the method name.
- Observable, maybe: need to grab methods to call later, or convert an incoming JS function into a wrapper around one of the specific method.

[02:18:31.0030] <Domenic>
Unifying streams & EventListener & observable-maybe seems doable, with minor tradeoffs in syntax that make one case nicer than others.

[02:19:18.0438] <Domenic>
Custom elements is probably too wacky, although you might want to design both at once and share as much infrastructure & syntax as possible.

[02:19:57.0322] <Domenic>
Oh right, what do worklets need... I think they're the same as custom elements?

[02:21:27.0127] <Domenic>
Yes, or at least PaintWorklet is

[02:23:55.0242] <annevk>
Does kind of have strong "callback interface" vibes

[02:25:03.0466] <Domenic>
I dunno, I think you're forgetting how weird and Java-ey callback interfaces were. E.g. the constants, the legacy callback interface object stuff. They definitely didn't have dictionary-type semantics for properties, which is what we'd want here.

[02:25:25.0044] <Domenic>
I guess I would say "callback dictionary" is what we want, vs. "callback interface"

[02:26:26.0794] <annevk>
True, `NodeFilter` still exists btw

[02:44:34.0064] <annevk>
akaster: using a process as agent boundary seems interesting, but also quite bad for perf? The idea is that a document and its dedicated workers end up in a single agent cluster. Which can be 1:1 with a process, but even that you might not want to do as you'd get many processes that way too. Existing user agents typically share multiple agent clusters in a single process.

[02:45:50.0569] <annevk>
akaster: also note that you can have multiple realms/globals within a single agent with `<iframe>` too, not just `window.open()`.

[09:07:48.0439] <akaster>
I think there's many lower hanging fruit for perf than process boundaries in our implementation at the moment. I think the isolation possibilities are a lot more interesting at the moment. And we don't even support SharedArrayBuffers yet üòÖ. From my reading of the JS spec it seems like there's no reason we *couldn't* do it that way, but perhaps some of the total ordering will force us to put all the agents in an agent cluster in one memory space in the future

> <@chargeitall:matrix.org> Is this anchor meant to serve as a placeholder to describe the grammar and lexical scanner? https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#placement

No, those are both defined in CSS 2.1, as the text says. There's no reason to describe them here, particularly as this spec is completely superceding them.

[15:01:32.0764] <sideshowbarker>
TabAtkins: About the test at https://wpt.fyi/results/css/css-animations/animation-canceled-by-parent-details-element-being-closed.html, I haven‚Äôt managed to to figure out what that test should rightly be checking ‚Äî rather than checking for a `cancel` event to fire.

In Chrome that test fails, because when a `details` element is closed in Chrome, the content of the 2nd `slot` of that `details` element just becomes `content-visibility: hidden` ‚Äî but the test seems to instead assume that the element is completely removed from the DOM (in which case, I guess the `cancel` event fires).

But looking at https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations/ and at https://drafts.csswg.org/css-contain-2/#:~:text=While%20an%20element%20is%20skipped%2C%20CSS%20transitions%20and%20animations%20on%20the%20element%20do%20not%20update, I anyway can find neither any spec support for firing a `cancel` event for that case, nor can I figure out what other event might supposed to be fired instead ‚Äî including, I can‚Äôt find any requirements for what happens to an animation when `content-visibility` of its containing element changes to `hidden`.

I‚Äôd like to fix the test, but at this point, I have no idea what to make it check for.

[15:12:39.0549] <TabAtkins>
sideshowbarker: Oh sorry, I know you posted this earlier but I didn't get to it immediately and then immediately forgot about it.

[15:13:08.0025] <TabAtkins>
So the test previously was assuming that the contents of `details` was `display:none` when it closed, which does indeed cancel animations

[15:13:09.0066] <sideshowbarker>
No worries

[15:14:19.0514] <TabAtkins>
but yeah, assuming details are now specified to use content-visiblity, the animation won't be canceled, it'll just stop updating until it's relevant again

[15:18:15.0339] <sideshowbarker>
OK ‚Äî I guess there‚Äôs no way to check for the the animation is in the ‚Äúhas stopped updating‚Äù state?

[15:19:11.0174] <TabAtkins>
Correct. But you could ensure that the animation should run for a decent amount of time, and then verify you didn't get a cancel shortly after closing the details (implying that it's still active in some state)

[15:20:10.0067] <sideshowbarker>
OK

For CustomStateSet/state-pseudo, there currently exists a test that says `::part(foo):--foo` should work.

Can I get some clarification on folks as to how that would work? Both in Firefox and WebKit where I'm implementing `:state()` it's failing on `::part(foo):state(foo)`.

[14:07:55.0863] <keithamus>
I can understand something like `:host:state(foo)::part(bar)` working but `:host::part(bar):state(foo)`? Are we saying all elements within a shadow root have the state selector applied?

[14:24:45.0736] <Luke Warlow>
A part could itself be a custom element with its own custom state?

[14:24:56.0147] <Luke Warlow>
So that would make sense to work.

[14:26:27.0758] <Luke Warlow>
Same way you can do "input:: file-selector-button:hover"

it'd need a corresponding ARIA role too; find-in-page and assistive technologies would need to treat it differently, and it's not necessarily a disclosure widget bc of the optional-ness of the summary button.

About the `Referer` with `location.replace` or `location.assign`: As detailed in my comment at https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/19093#discussion_r1378090398, testing (from a new test I wrote) indicates that Gecko and Blink set the referrer from the _parent_ frame.

I still don‚Äôt clearly know what the particular relevant spec requirement is, so update the commit message to remove any claim that the change makes the implementation spec-conformant ‚Äî and instead just kept the part of the commit message which states it‚Äôs for interop/compat with Gecko and Blink.

I need to ping Alex to re-review it again, but I otherwise have no remaining changes of my own to make. If the goal is to have interop on this behavior across all engines, then I think the state of the implementation in the PR branch is what‚Äôs necessary for doing that.

`type=number` is so attractive for identifiers, I also saw that mistake with `device-eid`

[03:49:35.0700] <annevk>
Perhaps `inputmode=numeric` needs a more attractive shorthand, but pretty hard to beat `type`

inputmode=numeric also doesn't do anything on desktop, hmm

[19:40:34.0908] <zoya>
https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#signature-for-webm Hello, I've been trying to rewrite the webm sniffing algorithm to js and encountering some weirdness. My first question was if anyone here has already implemented this for something so I can see how other people are interpreting it, and second, does anyone else agree that the wording is unclear? Especially within the "matching a padded sequence" algo, the phrase "...eventually preceded by bytes..." doesn't quite make sense. Do they mean "...evenly preceded by bytes", or perhaps "eventually followed by bytes"?. Also, the variable "end"  in italics is mentioned nowhere else on the page. I'm assuming it's referring to the end of the sequence. Finally, I've been testing it and found that removing step 5 in the nested while loop ("if iter < length - 4...") will yield a correct result, but if that step is enabled, it will not detect some sample webm videos I've been testing it with

[19:42:48.0050] <zoya>
Also, I've been working on doing the same thing with rewriting the tagless mp3 detection algorithm in JS and it seems broken too... yeah

[22:26:10.0461] <annevk>
I think padenot worked on that, but I don't see him here. Maybe file issues zoya as a first step?

[12:47:01.0719] <Jake Archibald>
Is the behaviour of `input.value` considered good, or if we could do it all again, would simpler attribute reflection be preferred?

[12:56:00.0369] <Jake Archibald>
I'm referring to how `input.value` initially gets the attribute, but then switches to getting some internal value when the user interacts or `input.value` is set.

Or would it be better to do something like `<details>`, where interaction is reflected to the attribute value?

[12:58:59.0888] <bkardell>
I think it would have been better to have an initialValue and no reflecting like that

[13:53:34.0524] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, the magic reflection is weird.


2023-11-15
[19:04:14.0606] <Domenic>
We definitely would do simple reflection, whether it's value <-> value="" or initialValue <-> initialvalue="". Whether we would then have a getter/setter for the current value... probably?

[19:06:35.0874] <Domenic>
Some previous discussion in https://github.com/tkent-google/std-switch/issues/4

[23:45:57.0332] <annevk>
I think all that's weird is that the IDL and content attribute have a different name, otherwise the design still seems reasonable to me.

[03:07:50.0409] <Jake Archibald>
To summarise, it's agreed that `input.value`'s behaviour is bad, but it isn't clear which of the following should have been 'the way'

- `initialValue` property & `initialvalue` attribute pair that reflect. And a `value` property (no attribute) which gets/sets the current value.
- `value` property & attribute pair that reflect.

[03:11:16.0203] <Jake Archibald>
The latter seems simpler, but that means interaction with the element results in attribute changes, which has surprised some (eg triggering DOM mutation listeners/observers).

[03:16:28.0705] <Jake Archibald>
 * To summarise, it's agreed that `input.value`'s behaviour is bad, but it isn't clear which of the following should have been 'the way'

- `defaultValue` property & `defaultvalue` attribute pair that reflect. And a `value` property (no attribute) which gets/sets the current value.
- `value` property & attribute pair that reflect.

[03:19:35.0473] <Jake Archibald>
The former has better DX for frameworks that have 'controlled' vs 'uncontrolled' patterns, where they either want to declare the current value or the initial value respectively.

[03:34:28.0039] <Jake Archibald>
If we went for the `defaultValue` + `value` model, I assume that the `value` getter would get from `defaultValue` if its own internal value wasn't set.

[03:34:34.0711] <Jake Archibald>
 * If we went for the `defaultValue` + `value` model, I assume that the `value` getter would get from `defaultValue` if its own internal value wasn't set?

[05:24:17.0494] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: that's essentially how it works today. At the risk of being utterly redundant, content `value` is IDL `defaultValue` and IDL `value` is the internal value which defaults to content `value`.

[05:26:47.0431] <annevk>
I guess I'm not sure if I'd rename content `value` to `defaultvalue` or rename IDL `value` to IDL `currentValue` and IDL `defaultValue` to IDL `value`. I kinda like the optics of the latter.

[05:27:01.0030] <annevk>
 * I guess I'm not sure if I'd rename content `value` to content `defaultvalue` or rename IDL `value` to IDL `currentValue` and IDL `defaultValue` to IDL `value`. I kinda like the optics of the latter.

[05:40:28.0968] <Jake Archibald>
Makes sense. Although I think, without a "default" or "current" suffix, I think people would assume the value was current

[07:00:27.0648] <Jake Archibald>
 * Makes sense. Although I think, without a "default" or "current" suffix, people would likely assume the value was 'current'

(Happy about the progress btw! Really excited for this coming together)

[01:58:27.0448] <Domenic>
annevk: keithamus: starting from https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9851#issuecomment-1765614088 ... I can live with parenthesis, but the following options all seem a bit nicer to me:

- My split table
- My split table with the keywords as th (and update all other tables to have the keywords as th)
- Use CSS tricks to right-align "(non-conforming)" everywhere
- Separate "Conforming" column, maybe?

[02:05:28.0363] <keithamus>
The css-right-align option seems useful for improving aesthetics without compromising on AT readability. I also am happy with the separate conforming column assuming that we're only aiming to add this column to tables which have some non-conforming attributes (i.e. we don't have an empty column on half the tables).

[02:05:54.0661] <Domenic>
Yep, that was my idea

[02:07:04.0640] <keithamus>
Should there be an additional note on those tables explaining what conforming means? Or perhaps there is a concept the heading can link to?

[02:08:09.0282] <Domenic>
Throughout the spec we seem to use "conforming" without any links, but we could link to https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#conformance-requirements-for-authors I guess

[02:08:20.0772] <annevk>
The only option I don't like is "My split table", the other 4 (including parenthesis in this number) seem good.

[02:09:31.0835] <annevk>
And thanks for raising it in the meeting keithamus.

[02:11:47.0193] <Domenic>
CSS right-align looked weird

[02:12:07.0655] <keithamus>
Extra column it is!

[02:12:20.0291] <Domenic>
Also... I think the rows are broken? The description rows don't line up with the keywords

[02:12:34.0936] <Domenic>

What was the context for that discussion ?

[03:06:53.0947] <smaug>
(fix is to remove one line)

[03:08:09.0246] <Noam Rosenthal>
smaug: oh interesting. can you share the bug URL when you're not kind of on vacation? :)
I raised it because it came to me from a web developer and I wasn't sure if it's a spec bug or a Gecko bug.

[03:10:25.0250] <smaug>
I think it is basically a leftover from pre-webidl times. Microtasks were implemented just before new bindings in Gecko, IIRC.

[03:12:14.0142] <smaug>
Noam Rosenthal: but do you have a testcase, so that I can be sure it is about the same issue

There's a Google Doc with the minutes, not sure who's admin to share it etc. Panos Astithas ?

[05:59:59.0015] <zcorpan>
Shouldn't it be public? Looks like it's not, but not sure if it's intentional

[06:01:12.0972] <Noam Rosenthal>
I think so too, not sure either and didn't want to assume

[06:02:39.0917] <annevk>
The minutes are copied into the issues, which are still managed by `whatwg/html`. The document is mainly for those attending the meeting.

What a fun algorithm. It must have been invented before the <ol> element. https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#serialisation-of-a-color

[22:58:08.0776] <annevk>
Domenic: hah, Hixie enjoyed that kind of style a bit too much

[00:05:30.0398] <Yoav Weiss>
I'm reading through https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#prepare-the-script-element and wondering. Do I understand correctly and step 31.11 (for fetching of the scripts) is done synchronously?

[00:09:12.0839] <Domenic>
I mean, the fetching *starts* synchronously. The onComplete runs after the network gets back to us.

[00:17:22.0344] <Yoav Weiss>
ok. When does step 33 run? immediately after fetch starts?

[00:17:57.0488] <annevk>
Yoav Weiss: after fetch goes in parallel

[00:20:09.0913] <annevk>
Yoav Weiss: everything is essentially blocking until you go in parallel (HTML has created some confusion here by sometimes saying steps have to run synchronously, but the truth is they all run synchronously; we're slowly cleaning that up)

[00:21:04.0978] <Yoav Weiss>
The "in parallel" part is defined outside the processing steps, in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-script-element:attr-script-async-8 ?? Or somewhere else?

[00:22:34.0419] <annevk>
Yoav Weiss: presumably it's in Fetch, as I said, but there are sometimes things where HTML goes in parallel before it calls fetch, but that's also generally an anti-pattern

[00:22:48.0773] <Yoav Weiss>
ok

[00:24:54.0368] <Yoav Weiss>
It just seems like step 33 assumes that the script is ready to be executed, and it's not immediately obvious to me how it can assume that. But at the same time, that lack of clarity (or lack of understanding on my part) doesn't block me atm. Thanks!!

[00:27:25.0647] <annevk>
Yoav Weiss: I suspect it only does that for scripts without a src attribute

[00:27:56.0148] <annevk>
Yoav Weiss: at least the way I read that it queues for the src attribute cases

[00:29:34.0919] <Yoav Weiss>
ooh, I missed "steps to run when result is ready"

[00:30:05.0508] <Yoav Weiss>
that explains things! thanks!!

[01:20:01.0100] <Yoav Weiss>
unrelated to the above, I'm looking at https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#construct-a-callback-function and https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#call-a-user-objects-operation and trying to figure out if they are called from anywhere. Xref doesn't give me a whole lot

Hello


2023-11-19
[20:20:26.0318] <sirisian>
Very niche question about Web Components. (Not sure if there's a better channel). Has there ever been a discussion about a kind of :is() in CSS for targeting a custom element and all its derived custom elements? Say you define ui-a and derive ui-b and ui-c from that and need a global CSS rule that targets all of them, but you don't want to just :is() them as others might add more later without searching/modifying every rule.

[23:21:46.0259] <annevk>
sirisian: the custom element could define some kind of :state() thing you could match on (in the future)

[23:33:46.0029] <sirisian>
Was thinking more of an :is-a() check, but using a state would work.

[23:58:06.0968] <annevk>
sirisian: we don't really have instance of checks in CSS, just name-based (this is one of the problems with subclassing of built-in elements)

[23:59:09.0143] <annevk>
sirisian: so the best you can do with built-ins is to create your own branding system, I think (of course that could be faked by other built-ins, but most of the time it probably doesn't need to be robust)

jarhar: The code in the PR branch of https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/18785 has a working implementation of auto-expanding `details`. If you have time to build from that and try it, let me know if you find any problems. I put it together about a month ago but so far it‚Äôs otherwise been unreviewed (maybe due to waiting to get the content-visibility implementation further along).

[04:06:15.0949] <Noam Rosenthal>
Is there an existing term in the HTML spec for ‚Äútopmost same-agent ancestor‚Äù? Something equivalent to ‚Äúlocal root‚Äù in chromium? (Perhaps Domenic knows?) or do I need to get that manually?

[04:06:40.0203] <Domenic>
I'm not familiar with that Chromium term. Ancestor of what?

[04:07:26.0036] <Noam Rosenthal>
A document‚Äôs ancestor. The most top level ancestor that shares an event loop with this doc 

[04:08:37.0373] <Domenic>
You'd have to crawl for that manually. Sounds kinda sketchy though to expose agent allocation in that way...

[04:09:35.0970] <Noam Rosenthal>
It‚Äôs exposed anyway since this is about timing/who‚Äôs blocking the main thread

[04:09:38.0193] <annevk>
It seems okay, except that it can be cross-origin today which is probably not a property we want to build on

[04:12:27.0237] <Noam Rosenthal>
The idea is that each of these docs keeps the tab of how long an animation frame takes. It‚Äôs observable today because you can see you‚Äôve been blocked‚Ä¶ very careful about not exposing more than that. It went through chrome security and will be happy for spec scrutiny once the draft is up

[04:18:13.0551] <annevk>
Hmm, but in theory that could block across top-level browsing contexts as well, no? If they end up in the same process. There are quite a few things that can be observable which are nevertheless not properties we want to enshrine forever.

Absolutely. Let's talk about the specifics when the draft is up 

[05:05:29.0947] <Noam Rosenthal>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> You'd have to crawl for that manually. Sounds kinda sketchy though to expose agent allocation in that way...

Is that so also for getting the nearest ancestor thats top level in terms of same origin? (Nearest ancestor frame who has no parent  or a cross origin parent)

[05:11:42.0775] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: yeah, we don't have any agent traversal of that kind

[13:22:49.0464] <jarhar>
do you also need to enable a flag after building?

[13:34:42.0639] <sideshowbarker>
Yeah, the _‚ÄúHTML <details> autoexpand‚Äù_ feature flag (preference), in the Develop > Feature Flags‚Ä¶ menu (what used to be called the Preferences menu)

For example, something similar to https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZRIQbUKw9Tf077odCh66OrrwRIVNLvI_nhLm2Gi__F0/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g30f0fc55_0_152

Some attempts in https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3863 , outdated by now

[17:54:14.0264] <sideshowbarker>
One thing that‚Äôs challenging about implementing spec features is that the abstractions/classes used in browser-engine source ‚Äî other than Document and maybe Window ‚Äî don‚Äôt clearly map to spec constructs.

I mean the fact that, for example, there‚Äôs no, say, BrowsingContext class in WebKit/Blink ‚Äî instead the closest thing to that (and to a navigable) is called Frame, and it‚Äôs not completely clear that really does correspond very directly to the spec constructs.

And then WebKit and Blink have a Page class ‚Äî¬†which in Gecko corresponds maybe to a _docshell_? But neither Page nor docshell seem to map clearly to anything in the spec.

And because of all that, sometimes when I look at some particular conditional check in the engine sources, I can‚Äôt see what particular observable (JavaScript-testable) condition in frontend JavaScript code that condition corresponds to ‚Äî or even _if_ it corresponds to an observable/JavaScript-testable condition.

Example: `if (!frame->page()`)

Since I don‚Äôt know what (if anything) a Page maps to in the spec, I also don‚Äôt know what it means for a Frame to not have an associated Page, and whether a change to the code block for that condition is something that will be observable from potentially affect existing tests ‚Äî or that should require new tests.
