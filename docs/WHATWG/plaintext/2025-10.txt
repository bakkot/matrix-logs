https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11733 one of the repo admins should probably block this user.

Looking at the results of the meeting time poll, it seems there's general consensus that 1) we should keep *an* APAC-friendly time, but should decrease the frequency.  I'm thinking we should probably change to cycle three AMER+EMEA with one APAC-friendly time.  I'm kind of ambivalent if we use the APAC-AMER or APAC-EMEA, but seems like it would be slightly better to go with the former.  (Seems like there is slightly more attendance for the APAC-AMER than the APAC-EMEA on average.). WDYAT?

APAC-EMEA has usually folks from 3 browser engines, APAC-AMER often only from 2, I think.

@cwilso Both the APAC-friendly times are equally inconvenient for me. The APAC-AMER one is exactly the time of day when I’m busy getting my kids on their way to school and preschool. And the APAC-EMEA one is pretty much the time of day when I’m busy cooking dinner for my kids. So for me personally the AMER+EMEA one (even though it’s at midnight my time) is actually more convenient than either of the APAC-friendly ones.
