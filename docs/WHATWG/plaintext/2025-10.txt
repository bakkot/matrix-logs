https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11733 one of the repo admins should probably block this user.

(I deleted the issue as well, in case anyone wonders what's going on.)

Looking at the results of the meeting time poll, it seems there's general consensus that 1) we should keep *an* APAC-friendly time, but should decrease the frequency.  I'm thinking we should probably change to cycle three AMER+EMEA with one APAC-friendly time.  I'm kind of ambivalent if we use the APAC-AMER or APAC-EMEA, but seems like it would be slightly better to go with the former.  (Seems like there is slightly more attendance for the APAC-AMER than the APAC-EMEA on average.). WDYAT?

APAC-EMEA has usually folks from 3 browser engines, APAC-AMER often only from 2, I think.
