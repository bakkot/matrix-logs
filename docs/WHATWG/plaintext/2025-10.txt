https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11733 one of the repo admins should probably block this user.

[04:11:21.0624] <zcorpan>
keithamus: Looks like they're blocked. Thanks

(I deleted the issue as well, in case anyone wonders what's going on.)

Looking at the results of the meeting time poll, it seems there's general consensus that 1) we should keep *an* APAC-friendly time, but should decrease the frequency.  I'm thinking we should probably change to cycle three AMER+EMEA with one APAC-friendly time.  I'm kind of ambivalent if we use the APAC-AMER or APAC-EMEA, but seems like it would be slightly better to go with the former.  (Seems like there is slightly more attendance for the APAC-AMER than the APAC-EMEA on average.). WDYAT?

[15:35:47.0324] <smaug>
APAC-EMEA has usually folks from 3 browser engines, APAC-AMER often only from 2, I think.

@cwilso Both the APAC-friendly times are equally inconvenient for me. The APAC-AMER one is exactly the time of day when I’m busy getting my kids on their way to school and preschool. And the APAC-EMEA one is pretty much the time of day when I’m busy cooking dinner for my kids. So for me personally the AMER+EMEA one (even though it’s at midnight my time) is actually more convenient than either of the APAC-friendly ones.

[00:34:47.0244] <Noam Rosenthal>
I find the APAC+EMEA one to be the most convenient...
but I wonder if there are APAC people who semi-regularly attend either, now that Domenic has retired? And in general which of these is better for them?

[02:12:14.0685] <Noam Rosenthal>
Luke Warlow: regarding multiple methods - I found that web developers often look to do something specific rather then look at a "family of methods". The same way people prefer the multiple `Array` methods that do specifc things rather than using `reduce`. `element.insertHTML(html, "before")`    doesn't add much readability as opposed to `element.beforeHTML(html)`

[02:13:46.0518] <Luke Warlow>
Yeah tbf I guess my main unsureness is about adding so many new ones, with no real prospect of removing the old ones.

One other question is how does this work with iframes? Am I able to stream into an iframe element somehow?

[02:14:22.0976] <Noam Rosenthal>
You mean the inline content of an `<iframe>` ?

[02:14:51.0264] <Noam Rosenthal>
Can you `iframe.insertAdjacentHTML()` today? It would work similarly

[02:15:05.0946] <smaug>
I wish we hadn't added the explicit microtask checkpoint before script execution (when there isn't JS on stack). Now with streaming that wouldn't work quite the same way if a stream adds multiple scripts and first one triggers promise callbacks. Those might get handled after the other scripts. Unless each script execution is its own microtask

[03:08:49.0807] <foolip>
keithamus: if you want to reproduce https://github.com/whatwg/html-build/issues/297#issuecomment-3275025761, there's a bikeshed-experiment branch in both html and html-build to check out. Then run `./build.sh --bikeshed --no-update` to see if it works at all.

[03:09:17.0150] <foolip>
keithamus: to then get it into a profiler, I've edited the script to print the bikeshed command and exit instead of running bikeshed

[03:09:55.0960] <foolip>
keithamus: it honestly wasn't easy for me to get everything working, so happy to VC and walk you through the setup that worked for me to make changes to bikeshed and try them in a profiler.

What's HMTL?

[03:38:11.0637] <Noam Rosenthal>
Luke Warlow: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10122 has some good pros/cons about arguments vs. multiple methods from Lea Verou. I think Domenic swayed me towards the multiple-method camp but I'm not zealous about it. Will solicit more feedback from web developers about this. In any case, I added this as an alternative to the OP.

[03:44:47.0694] <annevk>
At this point I think multiple methods is more DOM-like than some kind of awkward positional argument. And although my preference would typically be to reuse the existing methods, we have made a decision of sorts here to break new ground so we can solve a set of issues. (For instance, built-in support for declarative shadow roots.)

[03:47:54.0772] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: re your `beforeHTML` comment- doesn't it make it sound like we're putting something "before some HTML"?

[03:48:23.0739] <Luke Warlow>
Was there a reason that innerHTML didn't just support DSD? Afaik it's a Boolean flag set based on the method used. Was it compat?

(XSS protection from injecting shadow DOM by surprise without an opt in, to cut an extremely long story short)

[03:57:59.0095] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I suppose, but I think it's still preferable as it's consistent with appendHTML and setHTML and such.

[04:13:06.0654] <freddy>
`beforeHTML` and `appendHTML` would sanitize such that we would need an ´...Unsafe` friend for all of these, that's still correct right?

[04:13:12.0240] <freddy>
* `beforeHTML` and `appendHTML` would sanitize such that we would need an `...Unsafe` friend for all of these, that's still correct right?

[04:15:31.0503] <Noam Rosenthal>
We would need an unsafe friend for all of them.
- sanitizer is not a thing yet
- you don't always want to sanitize. you might trust the source and want to run scripts etc. "Unsafe" doesn't mean "bad", it means "only run this from a trusted source"

[04:15:56.0129] <freddy>
Nvm. I should just read on GitHub.

[04:16:36.0173] <freddy>
Yeah, I agree. Unsafe doesn't mean bad. It's the sharp knife.

[04:20:33.0705] <Noam Rosenthal>
I have a feeling webdevs would push back on consistency winning in this one... also `setHTML` is corresponding to `replaceChildren` so we're not 100% consistent to begin with. Either way, bikeshedding is a sign that we've made some progress :)

[04:22:40.0522] <freddy>
looking forward to the first time I see a website using `setHTML()` irl

[04:35:25.0243] <Noam Rosenthal>

Does anyone have any idea why the `keydown` event in the [uievents specification](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/) has [the default action field set to "activation behavior"](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#event-type-keydown)? I tried calling new KeyboardEvent("keydown") on the checkbox element via dispatchEvent. But it has no effect, even with `code="Space"`. Unlike new KeyboardEvent("keydown"), new PointerEvent("pointerclick") calls the activation behavior (it changes state of the checkbox element). What's going on?

click is special, when even untrusted events trigger default action 

[13:42:08.0001] <Maxim Vaarwel>
Of course I understand that; the specification clearly states it. As for `keydown`, that seems like a mistake.

[02:25:45.0317] <evilpie>
Can someone help me understand how https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-sort-in-ascending-order works. Does it return the sorted list or not?

[02:26:28.0587] <evilpie>
It creates a new list `sorted`, but it doesn't seem like it's being returned?

[02:30:37.0642] <Noam Rosenthal>
It constructs a new list... usually constructors don't "return" the created object. A lot of infra algos are like that (e.g. https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-clone)

[02:33:50.0478] <evilpie>
So it's kinda like in place sort? https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#collect-tags-from-speculative-load-candidates uses in that fashion.

[02:34:17.0671] <Noam Rosenthal>
no, to be clear the result of the algo a new list. But the algo does not use "return"

[02:34:19.0575] <evilpie>
* So it's kinda like in place sort? https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#collect-tags-from-speculative-load-candidates uses it in that fashion.

[02:35:14.0304] <Noam Rosenthal>
it's like `new List(old_list.ascending_sorted_items)`

[02:35:27.0692] <Noam Rosenthal>
There is no "return" here, but the result is equivalent to returning something

[02:39:45.0959] <evilpie>
So would a correct use look like "Set tags to sort in acending order tags" or does "Sort in acending order tags" also implicitly mean that?

[02:40:07.0421] <Noam Rosenthal>
If it points to that algorithm, it specifically creates a new list

[02:40:08.0809] <evilpie>
(It's pretty obvious what the result should be of course, just nitpicking here)

[02:41:52.0511] <Noam Rosenthal>
yea it's a bit awkward... I read https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#collect-tags-from-speculative-load-candidates as 

`tags = tags.toSorted(predicate)`

[02:43:13.0781] <Noam Rosenthal>
e.g. in other uses like https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#convert-header-names-to-a-sorted-lowercase-set it's more explicit

[02:46:20.0839] <Noam Rosenthal>
The use in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/nav-history-apis.html#windowproxy-getownproperty also makes it look like a sort-in-place. But in both those usages (this and speculative-load) there should not be an observable difference between sorting in place and creating a new list

[02:54:37.0201] <evilpie>
Yeah. But it confused me, because I couldn't understand which way it actually works.

[03:04:38.0882] <zcorpan>
Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]: ping https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/226

[04:59:26.0065] <annevk>
evilpie: I think you should file an issue. It should return the newly created list I think. I don't think it's a constructor (IDL has specific logic for "constructor steps", but those don't apply to everyday algorithms, just "constructor steps").

hello folks, I hope you're all good.
I'm a Web developer, and I'm working with custom elements these days.
I've been using them with forms, and have been successful using formAssociated and ElementInternals to make the inputs in a shadowroot properly expose their values to the wrapping form.
But I couldn't find an easy way to make a custom element behave as a submit button for the form.
The goal is to get all the default form behaviors, especially related to the implicit submission when pressing "enter" when the focus is in an input, but also possibly other behaviors that I don't know (I'm thinking of accessibility-related things, or the new dialog and popover-related features).

I tried setting the `form` property on the button itself, but it's read only.
I tried setting setFormValue on the element's internals, but that didn't work.

Is there something I've missed in the spec? Or should I file an issue to explain this more (with an example maybe)?

[07:20:26.0276] <Kaiido>
I suppose that'd be https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/814

Yoav Weiss nicolo-ribaudo generally with JS module imports the URL is an observable, right? It's a thing you de-duplicate with. That seems a bit annoying with the `data:` URL approach for CSS module scripts. Although maybe the de-duplication is not strictly observable? Hmm.

[12:14:10.0532] <zaggy1024>
Hi, I'm working on (re)implementing HTMLMediaElement for the Ladybird browser, and I've noticed a few issues I'd like to sanity check before writing issues/PRs for the spec. I hope I'm in the right place!

The main thing I wanted to bring up is that the `ended` attribute and the condition under which the internal play steps seek back to the earliest position don't seem to agree with existing implementations. Specifically, when the `looped` attribute is unset, playback reaches the end, then the `looped` attribute is subsequently set, the spec seems to dictate that the `ended` attribute is then `false`, and the play steps do not seek to the earliest position. Chrome and Firefox both keep the `ended` attribute set to `true`, and seek to the start. 

I wonder if the `ended` attribute should be a variable set to `true` when reaching the end of playback, and then set to `false` when beginning a seek, and then the play steps should rely on the value of that attribute to dictate whether to seek to the earliest position.

Alternatively perhaps, the `has ended playback` definition could specify that the `looped` attribute must only be unset when the playback first reaches the end of the resource, which I want to say would have the same effect.

Let me know if there's another spec interpretation for any of this, not sure if I'm missing anything.

^ @jarhar ?

nicolo-ribaudo: thank you, that makes a lot of sense! There's a proposal for declarative CSS modules and the proposal is currently to represent `style type=module` element as `data:` URLs in the module map. But that requiring that representation (due to it being observable) seems highly inefficient for implementations.

[23:42:06.0477] <annevk>

[23:46:37.0422] <annevk>

But that requiring that representation (due to it being observable) seems highly inefficient for implementations.

Maybe it could use a UUID like for blob URLs

[00:00:28.0172] <annevk>
Yeah, it would have to be something like that. Or we allow for the module map to contain element references or some such. Either way it will be more involved to define, but should be doable.

[03:53:53.0809] <annevk>
I wonder if people will use HTML patching to workaround limitations imposed by insertion modes. E.g., it would allow giving a `tr` element a custom element child. It'd be very cumbersome to write, possibly more cumbersome than writing the equivalent script, but it would be possible.

[04:01:12.0475] <Noam Rosenthal>
We could probably disable that option if it's important. When we open the template we know where the content is going to, and there is a finite number of insertion modes

[04:04:15.0139] <annevk>
I think making the `template` element even more complex parsing-wise would be something we will regret. (Although maybe we have to do it at some point for SVG.)

[04:06:47.0311] <Noam Rosenthal>
Maybe... though it's only for `template` with `contentfor`. At least in the blink prototype so far this is pretty well contained within "patching"

[04:07:28.0437] <Noam Rosenthal>
Specifically, we could make it so that https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#clear-the-stack-back-to-a-table-context fails the parser if it reaches a `<template contentfor>`. We could apply this kind of behavior in all of those special cases

[04:08:47.0400] <Noam Rosenthal>
* Specifically, we could make it so that https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#clear-the-stack-back-to-a-table-context fails the patch if it reaches a `<template contentfor>` when popping. We could apply this kind of behavior in all of those special cases and in general stop patching in certain scenarios

[04:10:40.0053] <Noam Rosenthal>
One of the main advantages for using `<template>` is that the default behavior in browsers that don't support patching is a noop and that it's already set up to be a container for any other content (pretty much). Also it's in the spirit of the element, something that holds HTML content that's supposed to be used elsewhere.

[04:13:54.0948] <annevk>
It does raise a question as to what the API ends up doing for these cases.

[04:15:55.0811] <Noam Rosenthal>
I think that if you see this:

<table>
<tr contentname="some-tr">
</table>

<template contentfor="some-tr">
  <td>new-content</td>
  <tr><td>Another row</td></tr>
</template>

you should end up with:

<tr contentname="some-tr"><td>new-content</td></tr>
<template contentfor="some-tr">  
  <tr><td>Another row</td></tr>
</template>



[04:16:41.0286] <Noam Rosenthal>

That would be very different from how `template` works today. Today the `tr` start tag would be ignored.

[04:19:20.0486] <Noam Rosenthal>
That's also an option, perhaps better

[04:21:20.0511] <Luke Warlow (ooo till 20th)>
Sorry slightly tangential but should the attribute be contentid instead of contentname, other for attributes work with IDs so it might feel wrong that is for a name?

[04:21:26.0613] <Noam Rosenthal>
but yea, `<template contentfor>` parses differently than template because it uses the target as a context node of sorts. 

[04:22:39.0151] <Noam Rosenthal>
It's more similar to form elements etc where it's not necessarily unique. But we can bikeshed it

[04:22:41.0761] <Luke Warlow (ooo till 20th)>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> I think making the `template` element even more complex parsing-wise would be something we will regret. (Although maybe we have to do it at some point for SVG.)

Mathml would also need solving, the cross namespace stuff might get particularly awkward?

[04:26:22.0015] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: a solution we thought about at some point is to force having a tag name identical to the target element at the beginning of the template to set the context. This way there is even less of an exotic parsing mode. But it's also a bit less ergonomic

[04:27:44.0958] <Noam Rosenthal>
... this would also fix the "patching into script" issue

[04:29:17.0183] <Noam Rosenthal>
e.g.:

<script contentname=myscript></script>

<template contentfor=myscript>
  <script>
     console.log("This is the new content of myscript");
  </script>
</template>



[04:56:13.0716] <Noam Rosenthal>
Or even have it so that the template only has "contentmethod" and everything else is in the direct children:

<table><tr contentname="my-tr"></table>
<template contentmethod="replace-children">
  <tr contentname=my-tr>
     <td>
     <!-- the following would not go into "my-tr" as it would be parsed as being a direct child of the patch without contentname -->
     <tr>
  </script>
</template>

[04:56:37.0783] <Noam Rosenthal>
* Or even have it so that the template only has "contentmethod" and everything else is in the direct children:

<table><tr contentname="my-tr"></table>
<template contentmethod="replace-children">
  <tr contentname=my-tr>
     <td>
     <!-- the following would not go into "my-tr" as it would be parsed as being a direct child of the patch without contentname -->
     <tr>
</template>

[05:03:34.0021] <Noam Rosenthal>
(Come to think of it, this is perhaps a better design... much less exotic changes to `template`, only the "contentmethod" attribute that diverts the insertion point)

[05:44:33.0400] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: yeah, that might be a better shape. Need to think about it a bit.

[05:45:01.0596] <Noam Rosenthal>
will do the same, thanks!

[05:47:05.0181] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: what do you mean with `contentname` not being unique btw? What happens if there's a duplicate?

[05:49:21.0122] <Noam Rosenthal>
It's not necessarily unique in the document. Since patching is scoped to the parent of the template, the first element in tree order within that scope would be selected

[05:50:09.0057] <annevk>
Gotcha. Though is it tightly scoped or only for the initial search?

[05:50:43.0947] <Noam Rosenthal>
It is searched once when the patch is discovered 

[05:51:06.0994] <Noam Rosenthal>
(which also makes it different from all the existing IDREFs)

[05:51:46.0875] <annevk>
`<html><head contentname=blah><body><template><head contentname=blah>` would fail then?

[05:56:28.0835] <Noam Rosenthal>
patches inside the body are special-cased to be document-scoped

[05:56:42.0448] <Noam Rosenthal>
* patches that are direct children of the body are special-cased to be document-scoped

[06:07:41.0863] <Noam Rosenthal>
We can also avoid both `contentname` and `contentid` and call it `contentoutlet`. 

[06:52:04.0513] <annevk>
`contentwendys` (sir this is the HTML standard)

[07:24:15.0779] <jarhar>
thanks! https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11772

[07:54:19.0425] <Luke Warlow (ooo till 20th)>
Is this something we can have tooling to check for? Feels doable now we have the algorithm scopes.

[03:52:42.0488] <zcorpan>
Noam Rosenthal: why does https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#prepare-an-image-for-presentation return early in several steps, without getting to one of step 14 or 15? Also step 16 is only run if no other step returns.

[03:53:47.0149] <Noam Rosenthal>
will take a look. Haven't touched that since 2020.

[03:57:21.0140] <Noam Rosenthal>
Regarding step 16 - it's perhaps ambiguous from reading but this step is optional... it's not like the image is not going to be presented without it. Step 16 is like saying "adjust the image presentation, now that the preferred density-correction dimensions are set"

[03:59:24.0033] <Noam Rosenthal>
Steps 8, 9, 10: it was a mitigation to having the density set accidentally due to e.g. EXIF information being copied around.
Requiring the dimensions to have positive numbers and only use inches narrows the spectrum for accidental density setting.
We can reason about making it more lax, it was a bit of a judgement call at the time

[04:01:06.0950] <zcorpan>
Noam Rosenthal: so then PixelXDimension and PixelYDimension are also ignored for the early return cases

[04:01:20.0621] <Noam Rosenthal>
yea they are

[04:01:34.0369] <Noam Rosenthal>
it's like "this is accidental EXIF information"

[04:03:17.0354] <zcorpan>
I see, thanks. It's still not clear to me that step 16 is not important, as it was the text in place of this algorithm before. It can be read as "don't render cross-origin images" or "don't render images with bogus EXIF"

[04:04:27.0589] <zcorpan>
I'll file an issue

[04:05:39.0502] <Noam Rosenthal>
Agreed, it can&should be made clearer. If you file an issue I'm happy to file a PR

[04:08:23.0812] <zcorpan>
Noam Rosenthal: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11777

[05:26:41.0187] <jjaschke>
Noam Rosenthal: Reviewing [#11762](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11762) right now, thanks for working on this! I like the idea of passing the upcoming tracker into the event firing mechanism, but now I wonder if we need to keep the upcoming trackers in the global state at all, or if we can get away with just passing them around. That way we're less prone to accidentally breaking global state. 
The only reason I see currently (I may be wrong though) why we need the `upcoming non-traverse API method tracker` would be to signal that navigation has aborted ([this step in `navigate()`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-navigation-navigate:~:text=If%20this%27s%20upcoming%20non%2Dtraverse%20API%20method%20tracker%20is%20apiMethodTracker%2C%20then)), but I bet we can transport this information in another fashion (which may even be easier to understand). 
WDYT?

[05:32:51.0111] <Noam Rosenthal>
Yea it would be great not to have those tidbits of global state... let me scan it a few times :)

[05:33:58.0758] <jjaschke>
Oh, also just noticed, the promote upcoming to ongoing algorithm that you inlined is also used in [reload()](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-api-initiating-navigations:reload-2:~:text=Let%20apiMethodTracker%20be%20the%20result%20of%20maybe%20setting%20the%20upcoming%20non%2Dtraverse%20API%20method%20tracker%20for%20this%20given%20info%20and%20serializedState%2E,-Reload).

[05:39:29.0910] <Noam Rosenthal>
THat's not that algo, it's "maybe setting", not "promote". There was only one use of "promote"

[05:40:06.0788] <Noam Rosenthal>
I think `navigate` can have a return value of whether the navigation was aborted prior to the promotion step

[05:45:05.0580] <jjaschke>
Ugh, of course. 
But, shouldn't we do the same we do for navigate (extract the upcoming tracker, then run the abort loop, then pass it back in) for reload? 

[05:47:15.0524] <Noam Rosenthal>
No need. Because we do that at the beginning of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#fire-a-push/replace/reload-navigate-event before we abort the previous one. It's only needed in the regular `navigate()` because it's also aborted earlier

[05:47:50.0309] <Noam Rosenthal>
Oh sorry we don't. sec

[05:50:58.0185] <Noam Rosenthal>
* Oh sorry we don't. will update

[05:53:16.0753] <jjaschke>
Noam Rosenthal : I see two ways we could follow. One would be to remove `upcoming non-traverse API method tracker` altogether and just pass it around (if that works, I'd prefer that). Or we keep it, but then I think it should be enough to move it out of the global state [here](https://whatpr.org/html/11762/305f5a1...3f2f0bc/nav-history-apis.html#:~:text=If%20upcomingMethodTracker%20is%20null%2C%20then%20set%20upcomingMethodTracker%20to%20the%20upcoming%20non%2Dtraverse%20API%20method%20tracker%20%2E), then I don't think we need the change in the navigate algorithm (and pass the upcoming non-traverse tracker into the event firing algorithm)

[05:55:28.0887] <Noam Rosenthal>
That's not enough because `navigateerror` can also be called from https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#beginning-navigation:set-the-ongoing-navigation

[05:56:52.0686] <jjaschke>
Thanks. Then I'd hope we can go for variant one and remove it from the global state whatsoever.

[06:02:31.0192] <Noam Rosenthal>
https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11779

[06:44:06.0352] <Noam Rosenthal>
OK I think I got it (in the new PR). I moved that state to be a boolean "has been promoted" on the method tracker. then we don't have to mess so much with `navigate`

[06:46:37.0990] <Noam Rosenthal>
this "upcoming method tracker" bit is only for `navigate()` and `reload()` calls to ensure that those calls return value is in sync with `navigation.transition` etc. so I think this new design is cleaner... it's either created early in those calls and passed as an argument, or later on for use of `navigation.transition` and the rest.

[06:57:48.0160] <jjaschke>
(threading this for less noise)
Noam Rosenthal : Why do we still need the upcoming non-traverse API method tracker as an object on the navigation object?

[06:58:38.0321] <Noam Rosenthal>
sorry, PR is not finished I realized

[07:45:09.0925] <Noam Rosenthal>
OK I think it's ready

[07:45:28.0338] <jjaschke>
looking

[07:49:00.0287] <Noam Rosenthal>
I think there is a missing thing there (and probably in existing implementation) - throwing an error when `reload()` fails. e.g. if your reload in an iframe aborts an existing navigation and the `navigateerror` event made the parent remove the iframe. this would currently return a defunct method tracker

[07:58:18.0069] <Noam Rosenthal>
in general I think this PR doesn't handle well the case that the document becomes inactive in the `navigateerror` even during a reload/navigate, because of the early "upcoming" check. 

[08:03:43.0976] <Noam Rosenthal>
(taking a look, I think it was OK before *because* we were making those checks a bit late)

[08:04:28.0992] <jjaschke>
Shouldn't we just hit the document-is-active check in [commit](https://whatpr.org/html/11762/305f5a1...83c1c84/nav-history-apis.html#inner-navigate-event-firing-algorithm:~:text=If%20event%20%27s%20relevant%20global%20object%20%27s%20associated%20Document%20is%20not%20fully%20active%20%2C%20then%20return%2E), which would then fail, and then we bail?

[08:06:03.0702] <Noam Rosenthal>
yea, but `navigate()` and `reload()` think everything is OK, and return a {committed, finished} promise dictionary that's never resolved

[08:11:49.0362] <Noam Rosenthal>
(nobody rejects those promises because they're only "upcoming")

[08:25:30.0057] <jjaschke>
Where would they have been rejected before? Wouldn't the old implementation also go into the commit step and return early?

[08:27:37.0584] <Noam Rosenthal>
yea but they were created after the abort phase (which is the original issue)

[08:28:16.0859] <Noam Rosenthal>
so the "upcoming" and the "ongoing" trackers would be the same, and the "early error" result (rejected promises) would be returned

[08:29:39.0778] <jjaschke>
What if we did another document-is-active check at after the abort loop? 

[08:29:55.0703] <Noam Rosenthal>
Uploaded a new revision

[08:30:21.0875] <Noam Rosenthal>
there is another active check at "fire the inner navigate event", but it asserts if "upcoming method tracker" was passed in

[08:31:11.0123] <Noam Rosenthal>
I removed this assert. Instead, when we are about to return from reload/navigate, we check that the tracker was indeed promoted. Otherwise we return the rejected thingy

[08:35:44.0165] <jjaschke>
But wouldn't we set the promoted flag even if the document is not active anymore?

[08:35:57.0066] <Noam Rosenthal>
nope

[08:36:45.0082] <Noam Rosenthal>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/nav-history-apis.html#navigate-event-firing%3Ahas-entries-and-events-disabled

[08:37:14.0920] <Noam Rosenthal>
inactive documents will get "has entries and events disabled". So "inner navigate" would assert (or return early if I remove the assert)

[08:37:24.0448] <jjaschke>
Ohh, forgot about has entries and events disabled

[08:38:23.0891] <jjaschke>
We really need a spec DSL so that we can run step by step and see state changes and such

[08:39:57.0274] <Noam Rosenthal>
hehe yea, my brain gets into labyrinth mode when I have to do this stuff. 

[08:40:25.0834] <jjaschke>
Should firing the event still continue true in that case? 

[08:42:01.0386] <Noam Rosenthal>
no

[08:42:02.0152] <jjaschke>
* Should firing the event still return true in that case? 

[08:42:34.0740] <Noam Rosenthal>
it should return rejected promises

[08:43:10.0547] <jjaschke>
I mean [this](https://whatpr.org/html/11762/305f5a1...3b1e3e2/nav-history-apis.html#:~:text=empty%20%2E-,Return%20true)

[08:44:01.0110] <jjaschke>
Which would mean we don't early return [here](https://whatpr.org/html/11762/305f5a1...3b1e3e2/browsing-the-web.html#navigate:~:text=continue,-be)

[08:45:04.0166] <jjaschke>
(I don't know off the top of my head what happens after that)

[08:46:22.0427] <Noam Rosenthal>
yea it should be true. otherwise about:blank and opaque origins couldn't navigate at all

[08:47:50.0004] <Noam Rosenthal>
but perhaps it should return false specifically when aborting made the document inactive, or there should be a check for that at the call site

[08:48:40.0295] <Noam Rosenthal>
I guess we can return `false` if `apiMethodTracker` is not null

[08:49:47.0285] <jjaschke>
I think that makes sense

[08:50:44.0975] <jjaschke>
Let me try to implement these changes real quick to see if it breaks anything :)

[09:29:41.0998] <mfreed>
Hi all, just a friendly reminder to post any discussion topics for this Thursday's joint CSSWG/WHATWG/OpenUI task force meeting to the meeting agenda issue: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11740

[10:08:25.0622] <jjaschke>
Noam Rosenthal: Looking quite good, I only get a few fails, and I'm not sure if that's just a bug in my changes. [This test](https://searchfox.org/firefox-main/source/testing/web-platform/tests/navigation-api/navigation-methods/return-value/navigate-initial-about-blank.html#17) fails because the promise gets rejected instead of just never settling. 

I think that is because we don't fire the [push/replace event](https://whatpr.org/html/11762/305f5a1...4c4aef6/browsing-the-web.html#navigate:~:text=navigable%20%27s%20active%20document%20%27s%20is%20initial%20about%3Ablank%20is%20false%3B%20and). Does that make sense?

[10:09:59.0583] <jjaschke>
(EOD for me)

[10:41:30.0858] <Noam Rosenthal>
the assert is wrong. This is actually a bug that this PR fixes

[10:41:58.0589] <Noam Rosenthal>
"has entries and events disabled" is false for the initial about:blank, so `navigate` and `reload` should return rejected promises

[10:42:30.0922] <Noam Rosenthal>
I think I'm going to make one change which is to move the "return false" thing to right after the abort loop

[11:48:55.0540] <Noam Rosenthal>
sorry it's a lie. The test is right; When entries/events are disabled the promises should be muted (never-settled)

[12:21:22.0188] <Noam Rosenthal>
Revised.
- setting the method to tracker to null before firing event if entries are disabled (but still returning it from reload/navigate, as it now returns unsettled promises)
- returning false from firing the event *right after* aborting; it's a bit cleaner

[12:21:31.0486] <Noam Rosenthal>
This should fix the broken test


2025-10-14
[00:02:46.0257] <Noam Rosenthal>
... actually, I think we can get rid of "ongoing API method tracker" as well since it's all now in parameters

[00:40:00.0319] <Noam Rosenthal>
(but will look at that as a followup)

[04:21:43.0028] <jjaschke>
Noam Rosenthal: I think (unless I missed something) that we broke traversal navigations: The traverse navigate event (which would set the promoted flag) runs [async](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#updating-the-traversable:fire-a-traverse-navigate-event), therefore _after_ we [created the result](https://whatpr.org/html/11762/305f5a1...d89ce86/nav-history-apis.html#:~:text=Return%20a%20navigation%20API%20method%20tracker%2Dderived%20result%20for%20apiMethodTracker%20%2E,-An), which checks aborts if the promoted flag is not set.

[07:26:38.0629] <Noam Rosenthal>
oh ok those checks should only occur for reload/navigate

[08:32:29.0656] <jjaschke>
Noam Rosenthal: I think with that change it should be fine from my end.

[00:13:45.0759] <sideshowbarker>
OK yeah thanks. I’ve just been trying to get a sense of how likely it is we’ll see any other implementations of it any time soon. (Context is https://github.com/w3c/charter-drafts/issues/690 and whether it’s actually useful and appropriate to specifically include the FedCM WG in a Coordination section in a W3C charter. [Though I think the right solution to the problem would be to just completely stop including a Coordination in any charters to begin with…]

[03:53:54.0843] <Ms2ger>
As long as you don't ban numbers in names :)

[04:13:58.0197] <Noam Rosenthal>
Done I think. Inverted "promoted" to "pending". It's only "pending" for navigate/reload, before promotion, and when entries/events are enabled

[22:34:45.0790] <Ondřej Žára>
I am having some difficulties applying CSS `mask-size` with SVG `<mask>` elements: https://codepen.io/ondrejzara/pen/pvgdZLB (size not being applied, both Firefox and Chrome). Any ideas what I am doing wrong? Or perhaps some better CSS-related channels where I can ask for help?

[23:13:53.0586] <Kaiido>
I suppose stackoverflow would be a proper venue for that kind of question.
https://drafts.fxtf.org/css-masking/#masking states that `mask-position` and `mask-size` do apply for the case where `mask-image` doesn't point at a `<mask>`,  though that doesn't seem very obvious...
But to make a `<mask>` fit its masked element, you'd generally set its `width` and `height` in percentages, and its `maskContentUnits` to `objectBoundingBox` (also beware `x` and `y` have a default `-10%` value).

[23:38:23.0745] <Ondřej Žára>
Kaiido: thanks for the reply! I am not sure I 100% follow your suggestion. Does this mean that the `<path>` inside of a mask must only use percentage units?

[23:40:14.0972] <Ondřej Žára>
Yeah, apparently -- that is literally what `objectBoundingBox` requires. But that would not work when I have a lot of existing `<path>` elements that were designed for a particular `viewBox` setup (such as 24x24 icons).

[23:40:36.0159] <Ondřej Žára>
Does this mean that my already-defined 24x24 path cannot be used as a scalable `<mask>`?

[00:04:27.0088] <Kaiido>
You could use a `<use>` to reference a `<symbol viewBox>` that would contain your existing content: https://jsfiddle.net/n30e7xro/ but at this rate, it's probably just easier to not use a `<mask>` at all and reference a full svg image.

[00:32:12.0701] <Ondřej Žára>
I see, thanks. My initial goal was to store many masks in one file (to reduce the amount of http requests). But working with individual svg mask files seems to be a lot more flexible.

[00:32:28.0440] <Ondřej Žára>
Apparently, adding css-styleable icons exclusively via css is tricky :)

[01:10:19.0293] <Kaiido>
For this use case there is a hack that I first saw from Lea Verrou I think, which is to use the `:target` selector to show/hide different elements based on the current hash set for the SVG url: https://jsfiddle.net/dn14ghyf/

[01:46:31.0234] <Ondřej Žára>
I see, nice! Is this `:target`-based styling inside `<svg>` universally supported?

[12:50:59.0106] <smaug>

It's flagged in webkit and chromium and not implemented in Firefox yet

[13:26:55.0551] <smaug>
right. I'm reviewing the implementation on Gecko side

[13:27:11.0894] <smaug>
and obviously the existing tests are lacking lots of cases

so I wonder how much it has gotten fuzz testing and such

[13:27:46.0385] <smaug>
in other implementations

I think that there was an origin trial, but little or no participation in it so it didn't ship.

Noam Rosenthal: I think we broke the spec with PR [#11762](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11762). We're now not setting the ongoing API method tracker anymore (I think you had ideas to remove it anyway). I'm filing an issue about it, so that we either reinstate it, or remove it.

Filed https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11816

[11:51:04.0367] <Noam Rosenthal>
Oh got it. We should still be setting it in the same place we were before

[11:51:19.0186] <Noam Rosenthal>
There's a few gotchas that won't allow us to remove it yet

jjaschke: Noam Rosenthal What is https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#fire-a-push/replace/reload-navigate-event:~:text=and-,apiMethodTracker,-%2E about?  Should it be apiMethodTrackerForNavigateOrReload ?

[13:37:48.0921] <Noam Rosenthal>
Yes

[13:38:03.0170] <Noam Rosenthal>
I think the link is correct but the text in it doesn't match

Fixed this as part of https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11817

Hey gang - in last week's WHATNOT meeting (https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11801#top) I suggested cutting the AMER+APAC (4pm Pacific) meeting out of our rotation, and doing 3 AMER+EMEA and one EMEA+APAC in the rotation.  If anyone doesn't think this is a good idea, now would be a good time to discuss.  I'll raise it again at tomorrow's WHATNOT to confirm.

annevk: was there some discussion happening elsewhere related to https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10673 ? I'm a bit confused about the comments about data: and blob:

smaug: I think in this channel Nicolò confirmed what I stated in my initial comment about `data:` URLs. I don't think there was any other discussion about it. (Other than me asking a question during the meeting preceding that comment.)
