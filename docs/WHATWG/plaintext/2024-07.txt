Kaiido: that's the result of partitioning: https://privacycg.github.io/storage-partitioning/

[00:53:03.0589] <annevk>
Kaiido: coupled with popups being an odd exception of sorts that we'll hopefully be able to address in some way

[01:51:08.0564] <Kaiido>
annevk: Thanks. Would you have time to compose an answer there? While I could link to https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5803 I don't feel confident enough to explain in which case this partitioning happens.

Noam Rosenthal: I'm not really sure what you're trying to say in https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/issues/234#issuecomment-2200440415

[08:27:09.0243] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: I'm saying that if a site adds text fragment to a URL, it's not up to the web platform to hide it from scripts

[08:27:35.0822] <Noam Rosenthal>
... mainly because it's not feasible to do it in a non-leaky manner

[08:28:16.0269] <Noam Rosenthal>
(the navigation timing bug is not the important bit here)

[08:28:26.0418] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: how does it leak today?

[08:28:43.0376] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk:  copy the link to another browser?

[08:28:59.0461] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: how does that leak it to script?

[08:29:09.0845] <Noam Rosenthal>
the other browsers don't hide it

[08:29:38.0200] <Noam Rosenthal>
you have to assume all browsers implement the text fragment feature for this hiding property to work

[08:31:30.0168] <annevk>
I don't think Gecko not implementing (which I don't think will remain true for long) is sufficient to just remove all privacy properties

[08:32:15.0765] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: it's also that some scripts use this for good reasons like enhancing the UI
