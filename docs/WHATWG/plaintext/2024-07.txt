Kaiido: that's the result of partitioning: https://privacycg.github.io/storage-partitioning/

[00:53:03.0589] <annevk>
Kaiido: coupled with popups being an odd exception of sorts that we'll hopefully be able to address in some way

[01:51:08.0564] <Kaiido>
annevk: Thanks. Would you have time to compose an answer there? While I could link to https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5803 I don't feel confident enough to explain in which case this partitioning happens.

[08:25:43.0855] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I'm not really sure what you're trying to say in https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/issues/234#issuecomment-2200440415

[08:27:09.0243] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: I'm saying that if a site adds text fragment to a URL, it's not up to the web platform to hide it from scripts

[08:27:35.0822] <Noam Rosenthal>
... mainly because it's not feasible to do it in a non-leaky manner

[08:28:16.0269] <Noam Rosenthal>
(the navigation timing bug is not the important bit here)

[08:28:26.0418] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: how does it leak today?

[08:28:43.0376] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk:  copy the link to another browser?

[08:28:59.0461] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: how does that leak it to script?

[08:29:09.0845] <Noam Rosenthal>
the other browsers don't hide it

[08:29:38.0200] <Noam Rosenthal>
you have to assume all browsers implement the text fragment feature for this hiding property to work

[08:31:30.0168] <annevk>
I don't think Gecko not implementing (which I don't think will remain true for long) is sufficient to just remove all privacy properties

[08:32:15.0765] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: it's also that some scripts use this for good reasons like enhancing the UI

[08:35:45.0333] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: since scroll position is anyway exposed, this is kind of a weird feature where the web page knows something about where it was scrolled to and can infer things about it but has to go about it in non-straightforward ways

[08:38:39.0931] <annevk>
All of that was known when the feature was designed. Doesn't seem like there's enough here to revisit that.

[08:40:07.0665] <annevk>
Did you discuss this with Google Search? Cause I'm pretty certain they care about these properties as well.

[08:41:30.0434] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: agreed, I should get back to the internal conversation about this before proceeding the external one.

[09:12:41.0270] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: context for this for me is that fixing the navigation timing bug was assigned to me a while back and we got a lot of push back about it breaking existing stuff that relies on that behavior... so I want to make sure we're doing the right thing by hiding the fragment in the first place. If it reaches consensus I think taking that backwards-compat hit would be fine.

Thanks for checking, let me discuss it internally

Ouch, I should have double checked that.

[01:35:48.0959] <annevk>
I guess this is not yet covered by WPT?

[01:35:58.0032] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: all good, let's find a way where fixing the privacy issue doesn't create both a backwards compat issue *and* an interop issue

[01:36:40.0527] <Noam Rosenthal>

[03:58:21.0848] <keithamus>
smaug: regarding https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9881 and your query on why we'd want to limit to custom elements, do you think having an API like `Element.prototype.connectedSignal()` would be a better fit?

[05:16:17.0368] <smaug>
keithamus: that is what I first thought, but then realized that this might be just one part of some larger API.  And I'm not sure what the scheduling should be here. Microtask? CEReaction? something else?

[05:17:34.0304] <smaug>
There is also https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/533

[05:18:50.0915] <keithamus>
I had prototyped out the elementinternals one as a CEReaction but microtask seems reasonable

[05:21:30.0223] <keithamus>
I'm quite strongly attached to the API being a signal as it's an ergonomic way to handle a lot of things like cancelling fetch/event listeners. The ideas in that issue seem to want to use the Observer pattern which to me feels "heavy handed" from an API ergonomics perspective. 

[05:25:34.0316] <keithamus>
smaug: curious on how you see this as a larger API, what more do you think is needed? 

[05:27:33.0904] <smaug>
I could imagine at least also attribute removal triggering a signal

[05:28:22.0597] <keithamus>
It seems like there may be some appetite around a large API for learning when elements enter/leave a page, similar to MO but with more fine-grained filtering akin to something like SelectorObserver (e.g. https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1225) 

But I think the two use cases seem orthogonal enough to explore options for both.

[05:29:02.0547] <smaug>
but in general, this feels like a one of mutation event listener / mutation observer thingie

[05:29:41.0738] <keithamus>
So a suite of APIs for managing connectedness of already connected nodes? If it was on `Node` prototype then that could account for Attr nodes right? Is Attr still considered a useful API or should we steer away from it?

[05:29:55.0904] <smaug>
no idea how it would work, but could it be something like node.signal("some filter") ?

[05:30:21.0340] <keithamus>
Where "some filter" is an enum of possible "reactions"?

[05:30:30.0144] <smaug>
right

[05:30:44.0377] <keithamus>
I'd be happy with that. Fits my use case. 

[05:31:18.0246] <keithamus>
However would something like `node.signal('connected')` returning an AbortSignal make sense? Perhaps no? Does it need another signal type?

[05:36:22.0546] <smaug>
("Abort" naming in the *Signal is unfortunate)

[05:37:25.0711] <smaug>
I was thinking your case would be node.signal("disconnect")

[05:38:02.0462] <keithamus>
For sure, and that API definitely makes sense to me. It's the other reactions where returning an AbortSignal makes less sense. 

[05:39:19.0665] <smaug>
Not sure why disconnect would be special

[05:39:32.0929] <keithamus>
I agree it shouldn't be.

[05:41:10.0292] <keithamus>
It might make more sense for an API of this shape to return a Promise, but that's not tenable for my use case... unless we can have some way to turn a Promise into an AbortSignal

[05:41:23.0374] <keithamus>
It also binds us to a microtask over a CEReaction

[05:41:25.0184] <smaug>
If mutation observer somehow supported disconnect/connect, could signal() take similar dictionary as observe(), but possibly without subtree? Hmm, no, that wouldn't be quite right.

[05:44:13.0986] <smaug>
AbortPromise (extends Promise) from which you can get .signal()  🙂  That would be a bit weird

[05:45:05.0635] <keithamus>
I'd almost go so far as to suggest an event on the element itself but I know that enters into scary territory...

[05:48:15.0884] <keithamus>
Maybe it makes sense to keep each reaction a separate method in that case? You could have a `disconnectedSignal()` return `AbortSignal` then a `connectedSignal()` could return some future `HappySignal`.

[15:43:10.0370] <akaster>
Bit of a long shot, but does anyone here have a direct line to Andreas Kling? He forgot to give us enough mod powers on the new ladybird discord and ... Well it's 1 am in Sweden.

Seems JSON has quite a few interop issues: https://www.mlsec.org/docs/2024b-asiaccs.pdf

[04:57:51.0503] <sideshowbarker>
> our analysis shows that the effects of an imprecise specification can hardly be resolved at the implementation level

[05:45:08.0935] <annevk>
Not entirely convinced by that part of the paper, but the interop issues seem real

[05:46:25.0805] <annevk>
For instance, one of the references to back that up is https://seriot.ch/projects/parsing_json.html which doesn't consider the Ecma document and the main complaint is about it not defining things around limits, though I can see how for numbers that does present a bit of an ordeal

[06:27:07.0265] <evilpie>

[14:13:19.0952] <smaug>
That should, in theory, trigger more mutation events, since it is just calling setAttribute in another (mutation) event listener

krosylight: how are push subscriptions scoped currently? An origin can in theory create infinite service workers. Would each of them be able to get a push subscription? Or is there some implementation-defined limit?

> <@annevk:matrix.org> krosylight: how are push subscriptions scoped currently? An origin can in theory create infinite service workers. Would each of them be able to get a push subscription? Or is there some implementation-defined limit?

I don't have an answer right now, I'll ask our push backend engineer. (I don't immediately see anything from the gecko side)

[05:37:19.0219] <annevk>
krosylight: ta, will do the same

[05:37:57.0731] <annevk>

[07:23:05.0937] <annevk>
Speaking of which, anyone here familiar with whether there's anything remotely like file signatures for JSON? Using a rather unique key is the best I've come up with thus far.

[07:28:48.0474] <freddy>
for people using json-schema, they use `$schema` key to point to a URL of the accepted json-schema format

[07:29:34.0135] <freddy>
maybe that's what you mean with a "rather unique key"? Even if a file has that special key, you'd still have to check that all keys and values are: present, not duplicate, of the right type etc.

[07:32:06.0303] <jrconlin>
Hi, Push Engineer here.
So, technically, a UserAgent could have as many subscriptions as there is numberspace in a UUID4. (Subscriptions are identified as "Channel IDs" or CHIDs). Push subscriptions are fairly cheap on the server side since at most they require adding a mostly empty row to a Bigtable database. The server then encrypts the UAID and CHID into the subscription URL and that's what you're getting back. Of course, having that many subscription updates will do frankly horrible things to the UA, which has to manage, decrypt, and process those subscriptions, so there's the very high likelihood that even if only a percentage of those subscriptions were active, you'd swamp the network and CPU for the UA. 

[07:33:05.0856] <jrconlin>
If you're interested, the code we use is [here](https://github.com/mozilla-services/autopush-rs/). It's in rust, with Python integration tests.

[07:33:19.0384] <annevk>
It seems that only self-identifies schemas, but yeah, I guess something like that is what I mean. And yeah, it's clear all the validation still has to happen.

[07:34:40.0752] <annevk>
But what about a website? A website can have many service workers (infinite, in fact) which means it could single-handedly DOS? That'd be bad, no?

[07:36:53.0018] <jrconlin>
By DOS, what are you intending to DOS? Our push server? The UA? 

[07:38:55.0909] <annevk>
Not sure, maybe it doesn't really matter as it's all behind a permission anyway. But might be tricky for the end user to clean up if it goes bad and it's not anticipated.

[07:39:24.0564] <jrconlin>
Push currently handles a ludicrous number of messages a minute. We are very free with 503 messages if we see a source generating a lot of messages, and even more generous with the backoff messages if we see some service ignoring the 503s.

[07:39:41.0204] <jrconlin>
Ah, so you're thinking more on the UA side. 

[07:41:10.0618] <annevk>
Yeah, I guess so. Services already have to scale and deal with abuse so the additional angle of many registrations for a single origin prolly doesn't hurt them much.

[07:47:30.0560] <jrconlin>
Ok, so here are a few odd scenarios that could happen:
1) Rogue site generates stupid number of ChannelIDs (push subscription endpoints). 
Each UA has to record the subscription info locally, so at some point there may be resource restrictions that it hits. Added bonus, if they're a mobile device, there's also a "daily check-in" that can occur which would make their device potentially useless while that happens. Eventually, they'd just reinstall the browser, I guess? 
2) Rogue site generates small number of subscriptions that it then barrages the UA with (ala https://mozilla-services.github.io/WebPushDataTestPage/ ) Mind you, the user has to agree to at least setting things up, and each push message popup identifies the source. User then has to disable the notification permission using native controls. 

[07:49:46.0906] <jrconlin>
I mean, in a perfectly frictionless network filled with spherical cows, then I can see this as being a problem, but in reality, I think there will be a number of other factors at play. At most, the user uninstalls or resets their browser. Subscriptions are generally not synced by any of the browser publishers for A LOT of reasons, so the recovery will not cause the problem to happen, unless they do the same thing again.

[07:50:38.0771] <annevk>
Yeah makes sense. I'm gonna ask around if we do anything, but I agree that things are prolly ok for the majority of cases.

Thanks for the help!

[07:50:54.0057] <jrconlin>
I also don't mean to dismiss your concern. It's very valid. FWIW, there are a few things I've seen in my monitoring that are sketchy as hell and I'd love to know more of what the heck those connections are doing.

[07:51:43.0810] <jrconlin>
That said, PLEASE ask more questions like this. Poking at the protocol is really, really important and I absolutely welcome folk doing that.

[07:53:15.0890] <jrconlin>
(Honestly? I'd be fine if the UA were to limit the number of push subscriptions to something, even if it were some arbitrary number like 256.) Like I said, the bulk of the work is more on the UA than the backend server. 

[09:13:54.0543] <caitp>
is this a reasonable place to talk about possible incongruency with web reality in webidl and/or dom? I asked a long-ish question to ms2ger, but he's out sick. It's entirely possible that my mental math is just wrong here

[09:18:50.0122] <caitp>
Copying most of my question here, just in case it is an accurate read of the spec algorithms not reflecting the behaviour of most browsers

Can you explain the logic in https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/dom/collections/HTMLCollection-supported-property-names.html#L114-L115 which results in this test being the expected behaviour?

My read of this is:

it's a Legacy platform object / https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#js-legacy-platform-objects with no unforgeables, so that simplifies things a lot.

114: define a property via https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#legacy-platform-object-defineownproperty

P is a string and O supports named properties, we aren't a [Global] interface, P ("new-id2") is not unforgeable, thus we're in 2.1.
creating is true (2.1)
O does not implement [LegacyOverrideBuiltIns], so skip to 3.
O does not implement [Global], so Desc.[[Configurable]] changes from false to true -- so we define an own configurable property with a value of 5
121: "new-id2" becomes a supported property name of O

124: LegacyPlatformObjectGetOwnProperty(O, P, false) ---

2.1. the result of the named property visibility algorithm is false (it's a supported property name, but we also have an own property)
return OrdinaryGetOwnProperty(O, P) -- We get a descriptor with a [[Value]] of 5 and a [[Configurable]] of true, because of the stuff on 114
126: [[Delete]] of a legacy platform object (https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#legacy-platform-object-delete)

The named property visibility algorithm is false again for the reasons lsited above
O has an own property P
3.1 The property is configurable, becasue of the steps on line 114
3.2 deletion is successful, and the property is removed from O
return true --- This is NOT what the test is expecting to happen (see line 133)
129: delete again, this time named property visibility returns true, and we have no named property deleter and thus return false -- Being in strict mode this time, we throw an exception (so this assertion would be successful)

133: We try to repeat the steps on line 124 --- However, because deletion was successful in line 126, this assertion fails (at least in my read through this)

However, I think all the major browsers are passing the test. So does this mean the spec is wrong, or am I just misreading this in a dumb way?

For text added with CSS `::after`/`::before`/`content` is there agreed-upon expected behavior for find-in-page? It’s not actually specified anywhere, right?

Safari and Chrome find-in-page don’t match on it, but Firefox does.

[01:07:41.0432] <Domenic>
It's not specified. https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#find-in-page is all we have.

[01:08:08.0310] <sideshowbarker>
Thanks for confirming

[02:03:24.0133] <krosylight>
So the opinion from backend: we don't have limit, and that's fine because adding a subscription is pretty cheap actually for backend and there has been no impactful abuse so far (there are other sketchy server behaviors that have more impact)

The journey isn’t over yet 😜. Still gotta integrate and hope it works well enough to not revert

When the parser spec has text like this, should insert link to something?

[04:19:58.0534] <Luke Warlow>
Context is I'm trying to track down where the html parser calls the children changed steps of an element (I think it does but the more I look the more I'm not sure)

[05:45:26.0974] <annevk>
> 121: "new-id2" becomes a supported property name of O

This doesn't follow. Supported property names are predefined in some fashion.

[05:47:45.0680] <annevk>
Luke Warlow: I don't think it currently does. And ideally we would link "insert" as well as "create" and "append" (and possibly more in that bit of text)

[05:49:19.0447] <annevk>
(And this is definitely the right place to chat about this.)

[05:51:01.0702] <annevk>
Yeah, makes sense for the server. See also the long thread with jrconlin above this one.

Still need to figure out if we want to tie the Window entry point to origin though. But maybe that's good enough as a first step.

[06:36:24.0388] <caitp>
my understanding is, in the case of HTMLCollection, the list of supported names maps to the list of nodes with a matching ID or name in the DOM, or subset of the DOM -- so adding the element to the DOM would alter that set, right?

[07:03:00.0004] <annevk>
Oh, maybe I didn't look far enough ahead. That does sound correct, yes.

[07:11:24.0699] <annevk>
Do you want to fix it? You already did all the work justifying how it's tested in WPT today, but I'm also happy to take over I suppose as removing that step is fairly straightforward. 😅

The Mozilla Website is the authority for **everything** having to do with JavaScript.  If you want something more tutorial I recommend downloading the O'Reilly "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" by David Flanagan but that is not free.  You can probably find a hard-copy of an earlier edition in your public library if you want to check it out.  The 5th Edition does not cover the massive changes to the language since 2015.

As far as the WHATWG evolution and core principles and history, I think the best thing is https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1623051423, which Hixie wrote (retrospectively) just a few years back. That at least seems to be closest to what you’ve described you’re wanting to know about.

[20:04:58.0599] <Domenic>
That seems good for history, which is I think what you're asking. It has lots of "I'm not sure how things work these days", which if you're interested in you can fill in by browsing things like https://whatwg.org/working-mode and https://blog.whatwg.org/working-mode-changes

In theory sounds reasonable, but in practice I'm not sure userInvolvement does anything when you're navigating from about:blank?

I'm trying to untangle some XHTML/HTML5 heritage. I'm aware there's unresolved differences here, but wondering if there's an interop approach here that's recommended in the interim.

In a nut shell, when using `document` to create elements for the current document, this creates Element instead of HTMLElement when executed in an XHTML document, despite the elements parsed from the server on the same document, being HTMLElement.

The impact is that generic JavaScript code like `var dropDown = document.createElement('div'); dropDown.style.display` fails in XHTML context because Element.style is undefined. This works in Firefox but fails in Chrome/Safari. Even after attaching to the body, it remains an Element.



[09:53:53.0814] <Timo Tijhof>
I found a couple related issues like https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/643 , and https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/217, and open ones about un-merging HTMLDocument, but this seems to be something else.

[09:55:19.0242] <Timo Tijhof>
It seems like step 5 here appears to require this, but I imagine this would have been fixed already if there isn't some other interop issue here that I'm missing. https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-document-createelement

[10:03:18.0154] <Meghan Denny>
are you able to verify in the network tab that the file is being served with `application/xhtml+xml` ?

[12:54:30.0956] <Timo Tijhof>
Hm.. well it was, but it isn't now. That might be it. So does this mean there is some kind of in-between mode where if the doctype/xml tag does XHTML, that informs JavaScript, but then the parser/DOM ignores that and just does HTML5 based on content type?

[12:55:37.0391] <Timo Tijhof>
Interesting, yeah, I have two different static file servers. One basic nodejs, and one python3 and the latter supports correct mime types for .xhtml out of the box. It all works correctly there.

[12:56:27.0000] <Timo Tijhof>

Is there any appetite to revisit what origins are supposed to be exposed via `document.ancestorOrigins` ? We've got an open PR to implement it in Ladybird, but I'm not sure whether there was any consensus as to what it should be doing from https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1918. Chrome and Safar seem to implement it, while Firefox does not

Hi, I was contemplating HTML entities and I realized that there are two entities, &nLt; and &nGt;, whose UTF-8 expansions are longer than their ASCII representations (six bytes versus five bytes). Only these entities have this property.

I realized this while writing an HTML parser in C, using constant string views to parse a document with no allocations and no copies. It seems to me that, in UTF-8, these entities and the mandate to replace U+0000 with U+FFFD are the only things preventing me from decoding inline HTML text in-place by mutating the buffer. I punt the replacement of nul bytes to the user, but because of &nLt; and &nGt;, inline text is 20% longer in the worst case after expansion.

Am I crazy, or is this a serious limitation? HTML is so close to being parseable in-place. I don't want to jump to the conclusion that these entities should be deprecated, but there would be a benefit.

I'm tempted to ignore &nLt; and &nGt; just for this reason!

[01:34:03.0702] <annevk>
Domenic: if you have a couple minutes could you look at https://github.com/whatwg/mimesniff/pull/192? I'd like to land it

[01:36:06.0734] <annevk>
lynko: don't you have the same problem with decoding bytes to text? E.g., 0xFF has to become U+FFFD too.

[01:39:36.0992] <lynko>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> lynko: don't you have the same problem with decoding bytes to text? E.g., 0xFF has to become U+FFFD too.

Sure, but that's malformed input, and I pass it on just like a nul byte (it's up to the user to decide if conversion is necessary). &nLt; and &nGt; make it a problem for correct input too.

[01:42:22.0434] <annevk>
How do you avoid allocations for creating nodes and such?

[01:45:01.0020] <lynko>
There's one flat inout array for nodes, if the parser runs out of room it stops writing but still returns the number of nodes that were parsed. If your buffer was already big enough then it happens in one pass and doesn't trigger a reallocation, and even if it does, you know exactly how much room you need. The parser also always produces a valid hierarchy even if it gets cut off partway through

[01:49:45.0505] <annevk>
I see, but that also means you have to keep the entire input file in memory as well, right? For a markup-heavy document I wonder if that's still going to be beneficial. But it's interesting for sure.

[01:50:49.0829] <annevk>
If anyone hsivonen might have some thoughts about this, but not sure if he's around.

[01:52:11.0054] <lynko>
It's kind of a specific use case, but I personally don't anticipate the need to parse files larger than I can store in memory. I do have some ideas about extending the API for streaming purposes with similar in-place properties... but it's beside the point

[01:52:36.0201] <hsivonen>
I haven't previously noticed this property of the entity names, but I have noticed that replacing U+0000 with U+FFFD is rather unfortunate from the UTF-8 perspective.

[01:52:58.0781] <lynko>
The answer is wilful violation :)

[01:54:37.0050] <hsivonen>
lynko: Does modifying the buffer in place really help? That is, don't you need an API that can report the content of a text nodes as multiple API chunks anyway? Once you have that, referring to static memory that contains the entity expansion is workable.

[01:55:47.0855] <hsivonen>
lynko: Can your tree builder side usefully hold onto text nodes that point to source data? Won't that mean retaining the buffer space for all the tags at presumably high cost?

[01:57:35.0563] <hsivonen>
lynko: also, when entities resolve to shorter output, won't you have quadratic memmoves that defeat the benefit of avoiding copies?

If all I really want is decoded inline text, then I just want to compute that text. It's always a bonus not to have to find a new place to put it.

> <@hsivonen:mozilla.org> lynko: Can your tree builder side usefully hold onto text nodes that point to source data? Won't that mean retaining the buffer space for all the tags at presumably high cost?

Tags are 75% of a document in the worst case. I'll always have to store a tag's type (and attributes) somehow, so I just use a single string view and don't decode attributes, except for parsing validation. I'm not sure exactly how the tradeoff works out, but tag content is usually a much smaller portion... I'm guessing 10%. Another benefit besides memory locality is that this approach preserves tags' case, although I don't store views of the closing tag

[02:03:41.0483] <lynko>
> <@hsivonen:mozilla.org> lynko: also, when entities resolve to shorter output, won't you have quadratic memmoves that defeat the benefit of avoiding copies?

This can be done in O(n) where n is the length of the text, and it was already O(n). Also it only matters for documents with extreme amounts of entity references

[02:05:13.0697] <hsivonen>
I see. I'm looking forward to seeing the results with the willful violation. I don't expect us to un-spec the two entities that have been there for a long time, despite them being niche, though. At least not without a use counter.

No no, I'm not suggesting U+FFFD should be changed. Too much momentum. And I wouldn't transmit HTML with nul bytes in it. This is for internal use, where I can optimize for correct input and retain control codes.

[02:08:09.0958] <annevk>
Also note that parsers in browser engines store local names (of most elements and attributes) as atomized strings. It'd be interesting to see the memory and performance differences though.

I doubt I could make a fair comparison. Browser engines have a lot more concerns than me, so they must have to make compromises of some sort. But you've given me a lot to think about. Short-string optimization and generating a new text storage buffer alongside the node array seems worth exploring.

[02:15:57.0607] <annevk>
Domenic: thanks, follow-up request: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/47002

[02:29:18.0973] <lynko>
One thing to notice is that if the input isn't held in memory, all significant text has to be copied no matter what. Hopefully a document is at least 90% significant. Standard tags only have to be scanned once to get their type. In place parsing is zero-copy, entity expansion is low-copy (guaranteed to be fewer copies than just copying all the significant text all the time), and entity expansion could be in-place except for the aforementioned entities.

I think this is a legitimate use case for HTML that could broaden its applicability.
