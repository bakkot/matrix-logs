Is that real?? They keep creating fun keyboard April Fools like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LI1PysAlkU but the day is not April 1...

[22:46:01.0346] <Domenic>
Last October 1 there was a cup keyboard so maybe October 1 is a special day?? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20pC05yisRM

[22:46:11.0812] <Domenic>
(Maybe this is what threads are for...)

[23:55:47.0331] <sideshowbarker>
I guess https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8344 marks the start of Hacktoberfestâ€¦

[00:09:51.0698] <Domenic>
It's opt-in this year so I'm a bit more optimistic... but we'll see how many people read the directions.

[05:13:49.0005] <annevk>
Domenic: you and sideshowbarker should figure it out! That cup keyboard looks amazing too.

[05:20:13.0950] <sideshowbarker>
I already ordered mine â€” along with a ordering an extra-long desk, since my current desk is deficiently too short to support proper use of the keyboard. Now I just need to move to desk to a bigger room, since I donâ€™t have enough free space in my current office to fit the improved desk in. But once I do that, Iâ€™ll be all set

https://japan.googleblog.com/2022/10/gboard-2022.html says they choose October 1 because many people use keyboards with 101 keys

[01:05:59.0206] <myakura>
I've seen a couple of those funny keyboards at Google Japan office (when their office was in Roppongi Hills)

[01:06:18.0134] <Domenic>
We have a kanji keyboard with ~2000 keys at the Shibuya office

[01:10:48.0703] <myakura>
Ah, the drum sets one :)

[06:10:51.0944] <Andreas Kling>
hey folks! I have some questions about implementing flexbox, is this an appropriate channel for that, or should I go somewhere more specific? :)

imagining a Taiko keyboard

#css on irc.w3.org might also be good. Also, most of the Gecko layout hackers hang in #layout:mozilla.org, depending on your question it might be worth posting there for more eyes :)

[07:48:52.0601] <networkException>
the irc channel should also be bridged to #w3c_css:matrix.org

[08:11:21.0808] <Andreas Kling>
awesome, thanks both of you :^)

Anyone with CSSWG write privileges want to close https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4683 ?

[23:14:48.0057] <Domenic>
https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5508 also seems fixed

[23:15:45.0718] <Domenic>
and https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3946

[23:15:56.0436] <Domenic>
OK, there's probably lots, I'll stop triaging another repo's issues now...

[00:29:59.0357] <annevk>
Domenic: I've closed those three issues.

[09:00:53.0203] <annevk>
mfreed: why `popUp`? Per https://whatwg.org/style-guide it's popup.

[11:48:19.0384] <khafra>

duplex: 'half' is the default.

[00:22:24.0142] <annevk>
Well, we do require specifying `duplex` if you supply a stream.

[00:23:42.0450] <annevk>
So I think that test probably needs to be modified. At least, I'd assume it throws a `TypeError` in Chrome.

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/36268 is the PR for that test. Thanks @khafra:matrix.org

hsivonen: r? https://github.com/validator/htmlparser/pull/75

[07:51:30.0462] <Dominic Farolino>
I know there's been discussion about the errors we sometimes see with the style sheets not being fully loaded from the SW

[07:51:55.0763] <Dominic Farolino>
I loaded a spec today with DevTools open and came across this, not sure if it gives any _new_ insight into what's going on /cc annevk 

[08:01:56.0402] <Dominic Farolino>
Btw I am reproducing this on every navigation to a spec as long as I have DevTools open

[08:20:37.0000] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: how old could this storage data be?

[15:33:07.0863] <Andreu Botella>
TabAtkins: Hey, could you take a look at https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/pull/7801 and possibly merge it?

[15:33:15.0743] <Andreu Botella>
MDN depends on it

[15:34:13.0842] <TabAtkins>
thanks for ping, I'd entirely missed that. merged

[15:34:45.0010] <Andreu Botella>
thanks

Interesting, I wonder if DevTools is messing with things? The requests should be "cors" since they use the crossorigin="" attribute.

[18:55:23.0038] <Domenic>
Oh I see that is consistent with the error

[18:55:29.0905] <Domenic>
How did they get an opaque response, indeed...

[00:32:14.0452] <annevk>
Domenic: I strongly suspect https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5339#issuecomment-1269482374 is correct, but a quick peek from you might not be a bad idea before people start doing a bunch of work you wouldn't be happy with

[00:32:40.0091] <Domenic>
Yep, just read it, thanks for checking. Will give it a thumbs up

[00:43:45.0428] <Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰>
I rebased it on Monday :(

[00:44:53.0520] <Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰>
annevk: so I'm guessing we're looking at either 50 or so web specs or 50 or so TC39 proposals

[00:53:17.0201] <Domenic>
Or they could just stop changing the meaning of current realm, and pick a new word for shadow-including current realm...

[00:54:05.0645] <annevk>
Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰: if we're including proposals there's gonna be more web specs

[00:54:35.0413] <annevk>
Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰: I suspect it's because there's also some other JS-related refactoring going on and maybe import maps had an impact?

[00:55:04.0177] <annevk>
Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰: the realm lowercasing wasn't the primary source of conflicts at least

[00:55:23.0852] <Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰>
Yeah, it's nicolo-ribaudo 

[00:56:18.0198] <Domenic>
 * ~~Or they could just stop changing the meaning of current realm, and pick a new word for shadow-including current realm...~~ Wait this is wrong, that's the change TC39 specs option

Those darn colleagues always making a mess.

> <@annevk:matrix.org> Those darn colleagues always making a mess.

We ensure job security for eachother 

[01:01:36.0442] <Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰>
Anyway - if I changed to "current realm" (incl SR) and "current principal realm / current principal global object / current principal settings object" (excl SR), that would work for you Domenic annevk ?

[01:01:55.0483] <Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰>
Then I just need to make sure nobody else complains

[01:01:57.0694] <Domenic>
Yep

[01:06:22.0500] <Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰>
I hope the light at the end of the tunnel isn't an oncoming train :)

[01:44:40.0088] <annevk>
Oh, some of my decl shadow DOM comments echo those I made in 2020.

[03:04:52.0635] <Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰>
Pushed some initial changes in that direction, more after lunch

[05:39:22.0184] <sideshowbarker>
About the `slot` element document-conformance requirements, did we ever consider making the spec require that a `slot` element must have a `template` ancestor?

Is there any reason not to make such a requirement? Is there any use case for a `slot` element thatâ€™s not a descendant of a `template` element?

(I vaguely recall that I may have asked this question before, but if so I donâ€™t remember what the answer wasâ€¦)

[07:08:27.0056] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: an actual descendant of a `template` element? Or being part of its "contents"? Did you look at the original `slot` element PR? I vaguely recall there being at least some discussion about it.

[07:41:36.0916] <dlrobertson>
At what point does a cluster of issues become a interop <year> effort?

[07:44:05.0451] <dlrobertson>
I've started working on upstream tests for https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1436, https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1464, and https://github.com/whatwg/xhr/issues/357

[07:45:00.0434] <dlrobertson>
but they're all very much related, so I wasn't sure if they'd be worth an interop issue

[07:45:53.0878] <dlrobertson>
also they're very much just a random nit picked up to learn more about the specs... not something I've seen extensively in the real world
