Is that real?? They keep creating fun keyboard April Fools like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LI1PysAlkU but the day is not April 1...

Last October 1 there was a cup keyboard so maybe October 1 is a special day?? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20pC05yisRM

(Maybe this is what threads are for...)

I guess https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8344 marks the start of Hacktoberfest…

[00:09:51.0698] <Domenic>
It's opt-in this year so I'm a bit more optimistic... but we'll see how many people read the directions.

[05:13:49.0005] <annevk>
Domenic: you and sideshowbarker should figure it out! That cup keyboard looks amazing too.

[05:20:13.0950] <sideshowbarker>
I already ordered mine — along with a ordering an extra-long desk, since my current desk is deficiently too short to support proper use of the keyboard. Now I just need to move to desk to a bigger room, since I don’t have enough free space in my current office to fit the improved desk in. But once I do that, I’ll be all set

https://japan.googleblog.com/2022/10/gboard-2022.html says they choose October 1 because many people use keyboards with 101 keys

I've seen a couple of those funny keyboards at Google Japan office (when their office was in Roppongi Hills)

[01:06:18.0134] <Domenic>
We have a kanji keyboard with ~2000 keys at the Shibuya office

[01:10:48.0703] <myakura>
Ah, the drum sets one :)

hey folks! I have some questions about implementing flexbox, is this an appropriate channel for that, or should I go somewhere more specific? :)

imagining a Taiko keyboard

#css on irc.w3.org might also be good. Also, most of the Gecko layout hackers hang in #layout:mozilla.org, depending on your question it might be worth posting there for more eyes :)

[07:48:52.0601] <networkException>
the irc channel should also be bridged to #w3c_css:matrix.org

[08:11:21.0808] <Andreas Kling>
awesome, thanks both of you :^)

Anyone with CSSWG write privileges want to close https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4683 ?

[23:14:48.0057] <Domenic>
https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5508 also seems fixed
