If anyone is curious about how to invoke fetch from another specification, I have good news for you. You get to both learn and critique my explanation of how to go about that at the same time: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1314

Do I understand correctly that `fetch()` can't return a `Document` like XHR can?

[01:25:23.0447] <annevk>
hsivonen: yes.

[02:20:01.0362] <annevk>
I know why and I also know I talked about quite a few times, but it's still surprising to me that `<a onclick="Promise.resolve().then(() => event.preventDefault())" href=...>` actually works.

Noam Rosenthal: hey, you addressed some comments in https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1311 but not all. Did you miss the other comments or are you still in progress?

does anyone have any views on where to file a bug about integration of HTML, MSE, and EME? specifically it appears that WebKit (at least the Apple port) treats media decoding as a blocking operation when waiting for a key, but other browsers do not, and it's exceptionally unclear spec-wise
