That's a pretty cool tool! Nice work asuth!

If anyone is curious about how to invoke fetch from another specification, I have good news for you. You get to both learn and critique my explanation of how to go about that at the same time: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1314

Do I understand correctly that `fetch()` can't return a `Document` like XHR can?

hsivonen: yes.

I know why and I also know I talked about quite a few times, but it's still surprising to me that `<a onclick="Promise.resolve().then(() => event.preventDefault())" href=...>` actually works.

Noam Rosenthal: hey, you addressed some comments in https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1311 but not all. Did you miss the other comments or are you still in progress?

Must have missed something, will double check !
