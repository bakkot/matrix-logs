That's a pretty cool tool! Nice work asuth!

If anyone is curious about how to invoke fetch from another specification, I have good news for you. You get to both learn and critique my explanation of how to go about that at the same time: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1314

[00:58:47.0089] <hsivonen>
Do I understand correctly that `fetch()` can't return a `Document` like XHR can?

[01:25:23.0447] <annevk>
hsivonen: yes.

[02:20:01.0362] <annevk>
I know why and I also know I talked about quite a few times, but it's still surprising to me that `<a onclick="Promise.resolve().then(() => event.preventDefault())" href=...>` actually works.

Noam Rosenthal: hey, you addressed some comments in https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1311 but not all. Did you miss the other comments or are you still in progress?

[03:59:20.0769] <Noam Rosenthal>
Must have missed something, will double check !

Yes I just looked again and indeed I missed your last comments. Will get back to this next week. Thanks!

does anyone have any views on where to file a bug about integration of HTML, MSE, and EME? specifically it appears that WebKit (at least the Apple port) treats media decoding as a blocking operation when waiting for a key, but other browsers do not, and it's exceptionally unclear spec-wise

[08:22:48.0554] <Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰>
https://github.com/webcompat/browser-compat-bugs ?

[08:26:26.0742] <annevk>
Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]: I'd start with EME; I think HTML might have an issue about better integration already

[08:27:32.0645] <annevk>
Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]: it's also fine to cross-file though ðŸ™‚

What's the best way to go from origin => URL in spec world? Best I can figure is going from origin => "Parse a URL given the serialization of `origin`"

Is this an appropriate place to ask a DOMMatrix question? (I stumbled into a W3C IRC a few weeks ago but I think that's not supposed to be so public?)

[16:56:48.0319] <sideshowbarker>
Sgeo: Yes, this is good place to ask

[16:56:56.0058] <Sgeo>
Is there a specific reason that the indices are backwards from typical math convention? AFAIK, m_12 is typically row 1 column 2, but with DOMMatrix m12 is row 2 column 1

[16:57:30.0451] <Sgeo>
Although now that I look, MDN disagrees with the spec (and with typical math convention) aaict

if so please consider editing https://github.com/mdn/content/edit/main/files/en-us/web/api/dommatrix/index.md to fix it â€” or alternatively, raising a new issue at https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new/choose

TabAtkins might have some insight into that 

[17:00:49.0119] <TabAtkins>
I presume that's just how graphics programmers usually write their matrixes.

[17:00:58.0957] <TabAtkins>
(I have no idea.)

Now I'm confusing myself

[17:08:05.0031] <Sgeo>
MDN matches the spec, n/m.

[23:34:53.0715] <devsnek>
how come srcset doesn't take the size of the image element into account?
