how to fix Insecure CORS Configuration?

[00:45:17.0288] <annevk>
Domenic: mind if I reach out to Mike and Artur for that module worker issue? Or perhaps you already have?

[00:45:29.0144] <Domenic>

Luca Casonato: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9668 does Deno need an issue for this?

[04:10:25.0657] <annevk>
smaug: I've tried to make the commit title clearer, will use that when landing

[04:11:19.0483] <smaug>
thanks. Initially when I just saw the bugmail I thought it was about some script bundling and workers ðŸ™‚

HTML tables have a defined schema, table -> tbody -> tr -> td
Is there a way for the row to behave like an <a> element, in a way that the row's link can be copied, or opened in a new tab with ctrl+click.

[05:00:44.0920] <vrafaeli>
Or is this just a bad UX, and a table row should have a column where the link is in?

Or would this just be a bad UX, and a table row should just have a column where the link is in?

[07:11:04.0720] <annevk>
vrafaeli: with scripting you can accomplish some if not all of that, but there's no way with just markup. Might be an interesting feature request for CSS to let a row act as the link of one of its columns

I have been designing web sites since 1993.  I started out with NCSA Mosaic and websites implemented on NCSA httpd.  I am tired of being forced to use JavaScript as the only way to implement dynamic functionality on web pages.  IMHO Brendan Eich only invented it as a temporary measure.  His exploitation of the Java trademark suggests to me that he expected the compiled Java language to eventually replace it, once the appropriate libraries were constructed.  Back in the 90s I wrote Java Applets and even taught a course on them.  But Java has been removed from all browsers "Because of the removal of older NPAPI plugins on which Java is built on."  But that was only one implementation of the Java VM.

You can write a script to go to another URL based upon information in the row: trow.addEventListener('click', eventhandler);  Remember to set role="link" and to use styles to notify users that it is a link.  See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/link_role for caveats.

uh, sorry it takes so long for me to respond. I have returned to working on navigables implementation for LibWeb and seems like I found another bug https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9686.

[04:55:05.0062] <Alexander Kalenik>
I will let you know once I've tried to actually implement your suggestion to solve destroy/abort bug.

[06:44:50.0215] <vhilla>
annevk: there hasn't been any progress on https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9469, can you please take a look?

[07:21:09.0511] <annevk>
vhilla: thanks for the ping, I'll relay it internally

[07:22:21.0193] <annevk>
vhilla: I guess it's not just up to WebKit though, if Chromium and Gecko want to have this specific divide there's nothing really stopping you from working on specifying it, unless Yusuke comes up with a strong reason not to, but I kinda doubt it

[09:05:31.0497] <annevk>
So since Ian Hickson worked on HTML, is it correct we added only these new elements:

1. Custom elements
2. slot
3. search

?

Thereâ€™s https://platform.html5.org/history/ â€” but it seems I stopped adding to that at roughly around the same time Hixie moved on

Domenic: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1475907#c4 - is this right? The navigation event deliberately doesn't fire when traversing to a bfcache'd page?

No, seems like a bug. There's nothing in the spec that looks at the destination's bfcache status.

[04:02:36.0193] <Jake Archibald>
That was my reading/hunch too.

[04:02:49.0795] <Domenic>
It should work, same-origin

Hi folks. [WebDriver BiDi would like to hook in to "run the animation frame callbacks."](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/#issue-b2b83ca0) I'm thinking HTML could define a general-purpose extension point for that situation (maybe with a queue of tasks into which a spec like BiDi could push), it it could explicitly invoke an algorithm provided by BiDi. Is there a preference between these two? Or a more appropriate approach that I haven't considered?

[15:52:41.0380] <jugglinmike>
[Looks like "Update the rendering" has already been extended with steps to inform other specs of this event](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#update-the-rendering)


2023-09-07
[19:10:19.0942] <Domenic>
jugglinmike: we prefer explicit callbacks these days, like we've done for all other WebDriver BiDi hooks.

[19:10:26.0457] <Domenic>
In particular, this helps get the ordering clear.

[19:10:55.0245] <Domenic>
Not sure what hooks you're referring to that already exist, although it's a long section so maybe I just missed them

[19:11:34.0583] <Domenic>
Oh you mean the many specific ones, not a generic one.

Hello All,

[02:09:02.0795] <sbastiandev>
I am almost done implementing the latest URL Spec in Java and was wondering if the various URL's setters should throw Exceptions when something goes wrong ? I read the specification and didn't find anything on this ? Can anyone shed some light ? Thx a lot

[03:24:58.0636] <Noam Rosenthal>
sbastiandev: judging by this note: https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#validation-error whether validation errors throw is left to the user agent

[03:28:47.0946] <Noam Rosenthal>
as in, the web platform doesn't throw on validation errors (based on the note, for backwards compatibility), but conformance checkers probably should. Makes sense to me that this is a library/platform decision rather than spec decision. probably some people here with more context though

[05:36:54.0153] <sbastiandev>
> <@noamr:matrix.org> sbastiandev: judging by this note: https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#validation-error whether validation errors throw is left to the user agent

Thanks for your reply. The main concern though is that you've got cases where the behavior of setting parts versus parsing a url is not consistent in term of reporting failures. For instance parsing a url with a wrong port would fail. However calling url.port = "bad-port-number" would not. But as you said it's probably a library/platform decision. Thank you

[05:46:41.0435] <Noam Rosenthal>
sbastiandev:  if you see the setter algorithm, those do something and then call the parsing algorithm and some parsing leads to validation errors, which leads back to this note

[05:46:54.0317] <Noam Rosenthal>
(setter algorithms)

[05:48:00.0107] <Noam Rosenthal>
e.g. "The protocol setter steps are to *basic URL parse* the given value, followed by U+003A (:), with thisâ€™s URL as url and scheme start state as state override."

[07:57:38.0707] <jugglinmike>
Thanks Domenic !

[08:03:36.0835] <Dominic Farolino>
Can you define a custom conversion from arbitrary ES types to your specific IDL type? Like, if I have an interface, and I want methods that accept objects of that interface type to also accept a handful of other types that my native interface type can be constructed from, how can I do this? Do those methods have to accept `any`, and then I just write their dfn as delegating to an internal conversion algorithm that I provide? Or can I just accept `MyInterface` types, and specify some some conversion algorithm that gets invoked whenever anything is passed in as a `MyInterface`?

[08:04:22.0617] <Dominic Farolino>
I think I'm interested in simulating something like the WebIDL Promise type, which accepts all thenables but also native Promises, IIUC

[08:05:18.0292] <Dominic Farolino>
(Context is for https://github.com/domfarolino/observable, where it'd be nice for methods that accept an Observable to also accept Async Iterables, that Observables can be constructed around to wrap)

[08:07:30.0329] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: define ObservableInit as a union of Observable and whatever syntax we have for async iterables (maybe needs to be added?) and make people use that?

[08:07:56.0931] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: Promise is an ES type and therefore gets its own to-and-from ES conversion, but you don't have that if you define an interface

[08:11:16.0577] <Dominic Farolino>
Yeah it's the latter part of "and whatever syntax we have for async iterables" that I'm stuck on. We of course have syntax to make an interface async iterable, but I'm not sure that's usable from within a union... perhaps it does need to be added though idk

[08:11:43.0499] <Dominic Farolino>
(Same goes for normal iterable I think)

[08:16:03.0313] <Dominic Farolino>
(Or no, I guess maybe sequence<T> can be used for iterable)

[08:41:35.0033] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: yeah, you want `async sequence<T>` or some such

[16:08:06.0080] <Domenic>
Dominic Farolino: I think you need `object` or `any` with manual steps. In particular, overloading on promises is basically impossible in Web IDL by design. And this would be the second method on the platform to consume async iterators, so you'd need to add something to Web IDL to support that, which I'm not sure is worth it.

[16:08:29.0176] <Domenic>
Oh, but, if this is just for `Observable` + async iterable overloads, then maybe that's worth doing

[16:08:36.0563] <Domenic>
I thought this was just for `Observable.from` which is very special.
