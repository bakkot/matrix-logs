Luca Casonato: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9668 does Deno need an issue for this?

[04:10:25.0657] <annevk>
smaug: I've tried to make the commit title clearer, will use that when landing

[04:11:19.0483] <smaug>
thanks. Initially when I just saw the bugmail I thought it was about some script bundling and workers 🙂

HTML tables have a defined schema, table -> tbody -> tr -> td
Is there a way for the row to behave like an <a> element, in a way that the row's link can be copied, or opened in a new tab with ctrl+click.

[05:00:44.0920] <vrafaeli>
Or is this just a bad UX, and a table row should have a column where the link is in?

[07:11:04.0720] <annevk>
vrafaeli: with scripting you can accomplish some if not all of that, but there's no way with just markup. Might be an interesting feature request for CSS to let a row act as the link of one of its columns

I have been designing web sites since 1993.  I started out with NCSA Mosaic and websites implemented on NCSA httpd.  I am tired of being forced to use JavaScript as the only way to implement dynamic functionality on web pages.  IMHO Brendan Eich only invented it as a temporary measure.  His exploitation of the Java trademark suggests to me that he expected the compiled Java language to eventually replace it, once the appropriate libraries were constructed.  Back in the 90s I wrote Java Applets and even taught a course on them.  But Java has been removed from all browsers "Because of the removal of older NPAPI plugins on which Java is built on."  But that was only one implementation of the Java VM.

You can write a script to go to another URL based upon information in the row: trow.addEventListener('click', eventhandler);  Remember to set role="link" and to use styles to notify users that it is a link.  See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/link_role for caveats.

uh, sorry it takes so long for me to respond. I have returned to working on navigables implementation for LibWeb and seems like I found another bug https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9686.

No, seems like a bug. There's nothing in the spec that looks at the destination's bfcache status.

Hi folks. [WebDriver BiDi would like to hook in to "run the animation frame callbacks."](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/#issue-b2b83ca0) I'm thinking HTML could define a general-purpose extension point for that situation (maybe with a queue of tasks into which a spec like BiDi could push), it it could explicitly invoke an algorithm provided by BiDi. Is there a preference between these two? Or a more appropriate approach that I haven't considered?

[15:52:41.0380] <jugglinmike>
[Looks like "Update the rendering" has already been extended with steps to inform other specs of this event](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#update-the-rendering)


2023-09-07
[19:10:19.0942] <Domenic>
jugglinmike: we prefer explicit callbacks these days, like we've done for all other WebDriver BiDi hooks.

[19:10:26.0457] <Domenic>
In particular, this helps get the ordering clear.

[19:10:55.0245] <Domenic>
Not sure what hooks you're referring to that already exist, although it's a long section so maybe I just missed them

[19:11:34.0583] <Domenic>
Oh you mean the many specific ones, not a generic one.

[02:06:10.0160] <sbastiandev>
Hello All,

[02:09:02.0795] <sbastiandev>
I am almost done implementing the latest URL Spec in Java and was wondering if the various URL's setters should throw Exceptions when something goes wrong ? I read the specification and didn't find anything on this ? Can anyone shed some light ? Thx a lot

[03:24:58.0636] <Noam Rosenthal>
sbastiandev: judging by this note: https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#validation-error whether validation errors throw is left to the user agent

[03:28:47.0946] <Noam Rosenthal>
as in, the web platform doesn't throw on validation errors (based on the note, for backwards compatibility), but conformance checkers probably should. Makes sense to me that this is a library/platform decision rather than spec decision. probably some people here with more context though

[05:36:54.0153] <sbastiandev>
> <@noamr:matrix.org> sbastiandev: judging by this note: https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#validation-error whether validation errors throw is left to the user agent

Thanks for your reply. The main concern though is that you've got cases where the behavior of setting parts versus parsing a url is not consistent in term of reporting failures. For instance parsing a url with a wrong port would fail. However calling url.port = "bad-port-number" would not. But as you said it's probably a library/platform decision. Thank you

[05:46:41.0435] <Noam Rosenthal>
sbastiandev:  if you see the setter algorithm, those do something and then call the parsing algorithm and some parsing leads to validation errors, which leads back to this note

[05:46:54.0317] <Noam Rosenthal>
(setter algorithms)

[05:48:00.0107] <Noam Rosenthal>
e.g. "The protocol setter steps are to *basic URL parse* the given value, followed by U+003A (:), with this’s URL as url and scheme start state as state override."

[07:57:38.0707] <jugglinmike>
Thanks Domenic !

[08:03:36.0835] <Dominic Farolino>
Can you define a custom conversion from arbitrary ES types to your specific IDL type? Like, if I have an interface, and I want methods that accept objects of that interface type to also accept a handful of other types that my native interface type can be constructed from, how can I do this? Do those methods have to accept `any`, and then I just write their dfn as delegating to an internal conversion algorithm that I provide? Or can I just accept `MyInterface` types, and specify some some conversion algorithm that gets invoked whenever anything is passed in as a `MyInterface`?

[08:04:22.0617] <Dominic Farolino>
I think I'm interested in simulating something like the WebIDL Promise type, which accepts all thenables but also native Promises, IIUC

[08:05:18.0292] <Dominic Farolino>
(Context is for https://github.com/domfarolino/observable, where it'd be nice for methods that accept an Observable to also accept Async Iterables, that Observables can be constructed around to wrap)

[08:07:30.0329] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: define ObservableInit as a union of Observable and whatever syntax we have for async iterables (maybe needs to be added?) and make people use that?

[08:07:56.0931] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: Promise is an ES type and therefore gets its own to-and-from ES conversion, but you don't have that if you define an interface

[08:11:16.0577] <Dominic Farolino>
Yeah it's the latter part of "and whatever syntax we have for async iterables" that I'm stuck on. We of course have syntax to make an interface async iterable, but I'm not sure that's usable from within a union... perhaps it does need to be added though idk

[08:11:43.0499] <Dominic Farolino>
(Same goes for normal iterable I think)

[08:16:03.0313] <Dominic Farolino>
(Or no, I guess maybe sequence<T> can be used for iterable)

[08:41:35.0033] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: yeah, you want `async sequence<T>` or some such

[16:08:06.0080] <Domenic>
Dominic Farolino: I think you need `object` or `any` with manual steps. In particular, overloading on promises is basically impossible in Web IDL by design. And this would be the second method on the platform to consume async iterators, so you'd need to add something to Web IDL to support that, which I'm not sure is worth it.

[16:08:29.0176] <Domenic>
Oh, but, if this is just for `Observable` + async iterable overloads, then maybe that's worth doing

[16:08:36.0563] <Domenic>
I thought this was just for `Observable.from` which is very special.


2023-09-08
[22:32:38.0489] <annevk>
Or maybe it would be cleaner if we made `Observable` a special type in Web IDL, so you wouldn't be able to return async iterables, but had to instead return an Observable or Stream, which I think is what we would (always?) want.

[01:59:57.0862] <Domenic>
Yeah I came around to that conclusion actually

[02:00:05.0861] <Domenic>
Well or something like it

I am working on implementing navigation, and I'm struggling to determine if the specification explicitly defines that the population of history entries initiated for nested navigables should be aborted after parent navigable navigates to another page.

For example, the following scenario currently fails with an assertion:

1. Both the nested navigable and the parent navigable navigate to a new URL.
2. The population of SHE for the parent navigable finishes first.
3. "finalize a cross-document navigation" for the parent navigable replaces the SHE (assuming historyHandling is set to "replace").
4. The population of SHE for the nested navigable navigation concludes.
5. "finalize a cross-document navigation" for nested navigable fails to locate the SHE to be replaced (assuming historyHandling is "replace") because it was located in the nested history of the parent navigable SHE that was replaced earlier.

Does that sound like a specification bug or I am missing something?



2023-09-09
[17:35:21.0749] <EveryOS>
Coincidentally, I also plan to implement the navigation soon
Though it's really dense (the intro paragraph literally calls it "the dragon's maw") so I'm 🌈 procrastinating 🌈

[06:16:26.0635] <Domenic>
Off the top of my head on a weekend, I thought there was a step early in navigation/traversal that would abort any current loads in the top-level traversable and its descendants?

[09:12:06.0165] <annevk>
Domenic: I think so, there was a concept of maturing and a new navigation would abort immature navigations or some such

[09:27:43.0932] <Alexander Kalenik>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Off the top of my head on a weekend, I thought there was a step early in navigation/traversal that would abort any current loads in the top-level traversable and its descendants?

As I understand it, if the navigation that is currently loading needs to be canceled, we need to set its "ongoing navigation" to something other than the navigation ID. I would expect this to happen during the "apply the history step" process, but from what I've seen, it only takes care of "changing navigables".

[09:31:38.0868] <Alexander Kalenik>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> Domenic: I think so, there was a concept of maturing and a new navigation would abort immature navigations or some such

yes, I would expect something like that to happen but haven't yet found this in the spec

[09:32:12.0196] <annevk>
Hmm, did that get removed in the navigation refactor?

[09:33:26.0687] <annevk>
Step 11 of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/review-drafts/2022-07/#navigate has it. So if it's not there now it's a regression. Pretty bad one.

[09:36:18.0707] <Domenic>
It's still there. Step 17. https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#navigate

[09:39:02.0479] <Alexander Kalenik>
right, changing "ongoing navigation" means canceling any navigation that hasn't been finished. but should we also do that for all child navigables of a navigable that navigates?

[09:41:18.0334] <Alexander Kalenik>
 * right, changing "ongoing navigation" means canceling any navigation that hasn't been finished. but shouldn't we also do that for all child navigables of a navigable that navigates?

[09:42:31.0965] <annevk>
I guess descendants might never have been covered. I guess that can happen with bfcache?

[09:43:07.0662] <annevk>
Oh wait. I think I see now. Yeah hmm, not sure.

[09:44:29.0378] <annevk>
Recalling stuff from long ago now... I think that ought to be covered by canceling all the fetches for the fetch group, but we never got around to specifying that well.

[09:56:28.0463] <Domenic>
Step 20.3 should take care of descendants

[09:59:27.0016] <Noam Rosenthal>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#abort-a-document #2 is a bit lacking in terms of what it means to "cancel any instances of fetch", I'd be happy to fix this as part of `fetchLater`, didn't it use to call "terminate a fetch group" before?

[10:02:12.0838] <annevk>
I think there was also disagreement about the point in time that got invoked where Fx might have been more aggressive? Would benefit from tests

[10:02:39.0527] <Noam Rosenthal>
Fx?

[10:02:52.0222] <Noam Rosenthal>
Ah Firefox

[10:07:20.0029] <Alexander Kalenik>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Step 20.3 should take care of descendants

Oh, right. Now I see, thank you! 

[10:08:10.0246] <Domenic>
Not sure we have the right thing for traversals though, to be honest. (E.g. if your entrypoint is "traverse the history by a delta".)

[10:08:36.0817] <Domenic>
Hmm maybe step 8.3? https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#apply-the-history-step

[10:09:21.0781] <annevk>
Anyone already in Sevilla? I'm flying in from Madrid shortly.

[11:05:46.0085] <Alexander Kalenik>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Step 20.3 should take care of descendants

hmm, I am looking at step 3 in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#abort-a-document: "Set document's navigation id to null.". shouldn't it be "ongoing navigation" of a navigable instead?

[11:07:10.0705] <Domenic>

Can someone review it for me?

[05:46:50.0094] <annevk>
Domenic: just came across https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102153. Seems like URL security research is still going strong.

[05:48:36.0703] <Domenic>
Eh, ecosystems which aren't using the URL Standard seem hopeless anyway

[05:50:17.0991] <annevk>
That's pretty close to one of the comments there from a long term maintainer. That they probably should have added a WHATWG-compliant package to std.

[05:50:42.0770] <annevk>
I hope they do it now, not sure they have. No time like the present.

[05:52:02.0841] <Domenic>
Yeah seems like there's some fun drama in the hidden comments

[05:54:49.0029] <Domenic>
Ah but the RFC partisans come out later in the thread, sigh

[05:57:36.0369] <evilpie>
The curl author unfortunately seemed very dismissive of the URL standard as well in a related blog post

[05:58:38.0956] <Domenic>
I still find that so hilarious... his whole thing is that he thinks `http://` is pure, `http:///` is necessary for compat, but how dare the WHATWG accept **more than three** slashes, that's just craziness.

[05:59:19.0106] <annevk>
Yeah, whenever curl encounters some kind of compatibility problem it turns out that following the URL standard would have helped, but following the URL standard doesn't compute for him so the URL standard is at fault.

[05:59:38.0286] <annevk>
I tried to understand it for a while, but gave up.

[06:09:21.0649] <annevk>
He's part of a larger group of people on social media that have the ability and experience to influence and improve web standards for everyone, but they rather complain about the status quo. Even when they know and could reach out to the people involved.

[06:10:09.0780] <annevk>
(And yeah, they bother me a little bit. 😅)

[07:13:36.0609] <annevk>
Domenic: "HTML-parse a URL", "encoding-parse a URL", something else?

[07:14:18.0482] <Domenic>
If it's only for use with `Document` objects, or maybe even `Node`s, I like "HTML-parse".

[07:14:19.0847] <annevk>
Domenic: the idea would be that the current algorithm becomes a sibling to a "parse a URL" that doesn't take encoding into account that we'd promote people to use that need some kind of document/environment base URL

[07:14:47.0313] <annevk>
Domenic: XMLHttpRequest and xml-stylesheet will use the legacy algorithm

[07:14:59.0264] <Domenic>
Maybe encoding-parse is best then

[11:43:47.0968] <akaster>
I'm looking into StructuredSerializeInternal for Ladybird, and steps 22 and 23 are tripping me up. From looking into blink, it seems like they defer to v8 for the serialization steps, in v8::ValueSerializer. And v8 seems to encode all the data about whether an object (a "receiver") is a well known ES object or ES prototype in a tag field. But LibJS doesn't do that, we just have a bunch of classical c++ inheritance. Like there's no "IsExotic()" function I can call. 

Do all the other engines do this type of tagging of JS objects so that those two catch-all steps are trivial and/or fall out of handling the known object types?

[11:45:42.0432] <akaster>
There's certainly no ECMAScript abstract operation I can call to say "is this a plain old object" (I think?)

[12:05:39.0319] <ljharb>
the prose "is an ordinary object" is how 262 does it.

[12:06:14.0792] <ljharb>
 * the prose "is an ordinary object" is how 262 does it (in a condition, or assertion, or parameter/return type)

[12:10:40.0901] <akaster>
Aha, there's like 40 or so objects in the spec that say "such and such object: - is an ordinary object"

[12:13:46.0857] <akaster>
But I can't clone all of those. Like, no promise, no weakmap, no Finalization registry, no Arguments, ...

Oh lovely. If I create a new RegExp(".", "") and try to structuredClone its __proto__ property, Firefox says "can't clone RegExp.prototype", and Chromium says "here's your object"

[12:24:11.0578] <akaster>
Safari refuses to clone it too 

[12:34:24.0984] <Domenic>
Step 22 excludes the ones you're worried about

[12:35:29.0891] <akaster>
Right.. the best idea I've got for that step at the moment is checking whether my JS::Value is an object and it's class name is "Object" 😅

[12:35:32.0042] <Domenic>
I do suspect the other two engines also do object type tagging, as it seems helpful for various optimizations

[12:36:52.0696] <akaster>
Yeah, Andreas was brainstorming a radical idea where we create custom vtables to check whether properties/methods are overridden and optimize based on that. But it seems overkill if I just want to get message serialization up and running to implement Workers properly

[12:38:15.0453] <akaster>
Eh. I'm sure some WPT tests for this and I can clean it up later

Sevilla lunch time perhaps?

[00:36:07.0375] <annevk>
hsivonen: https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/284 has the agenda, breaks are between the items

[00:36:16.0398] <hsivonen>
Thanks

[00:36:28.0503] <annevk>
So the first break would be at 11. We haven't started yet though.

[00:36:41.0542] <annevk>

we've had this in css for a long time, but irrc there were concerns around it https://drafts.csswg.org/css-images-4/#funcdef-element 

[03:19:13.0926] <jarhar>
current issue: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9373

[03:30:29.0961] <annevk>
mfreed: one minor suggestion, maybe `lightclose` so we don't introduce a second term for closing

[03:36:24.0416] <Hidde de Vries>
fwiw I've been calling the opposite of 'light dismiss' 'explicit dismiss' , might be another word we could opt for as the opposite of light close / dismiss

[03:53:08.0302] <hober>
"Everything is a lot." — annevk 

[03:58:40.0573] <annevk>
Hidde de Vries: I would not mind `implicitclose`, I don't think we want "dismiss" as a novel term as it won't be immediately recognizable as "close" to all people

[03:59:05.0807] <annevk>
Hidde de Vries: although `lightclose` and `softclose` seem easier to spell, which is another consideration

[05:28:28.0151] <hsivonen>
Is there a joint meeting currently ongoing with CSS? In the CSS Zoom, I don't see the meeting room on the call and I can't hear any sound.

The camera is still off, correct?

[05:37:42.0090] <mfreed>
Guess the answer was no, and that I needed to restart Zoom.

[05:38:24.0419] <krosylight>

[05:52:43.0305] <TabAtkins>
Hmmmm, if we want to have an attribute that always outputs a particular interface type from the getter, but wants to *accept* a dictionary type for the setter, is that at all possible?

[05:53:31.0179] <TabAtkins>
It looks like the answer is no, dictionary types aren't allowed in an attribute type, since the implication is that the attribute type is both the getter output and the setter input (and you can't use dictionaries in output types)

[05:54:05.0056] <TabAtkins>
(I suspect the answer is that, right now, it's required to type the attribute as `any` and handle the conversions by hand.)

[05:56:04.0368] <annevk>
TabAtkins: IDL has an open issue to split getters and setters (plus maybe have convenient syntax for when they're the same); we should still do that

[05:56:21.0634] <TabAtkins>
ah, cool. so "no, but later yes"

[08:29:03.0934] <Domenic>
TIL `document.open(); document.close()` is a "turn off mutation events" flag in Chrome/Safari.

[08:42:53.0044] <smaug>
That is interesting. I wonder what is the historical reason for that.

[08:55:41.0291] <annevk>
The specification requires flipping it on and then off. And maybe they just forgot to turn it on again?

[09:05:00.0452] <Domenic>
I think the specification is more recent though

[09:06:31.0438] <Domenic>
Ah, no, that part was untouched in the rewrite https://html.spec.whatwg.org/commit-snapshots/c9e804f04d03a0658bfa689cb0f368a4d2e37936/?C=M&O=A#dom-document-open

[09:07:21.0238] <Domenic>
Firefox doesn't quite follow the spec either, it turns them off until `document.close()` turns them back on, instead of the spec which requires turning them off just for the removal step.

[09:07:59.0147] <Domenic>
(or in the new spec, the "replace all" step)

[13:55:09.0500] <smaug>
how did you test that? Note, all the events listeners are supposed to be removed

[15:21:46.0549] <smaug>
ah, it is  a bit different. Listeners added after document.open() are called, if one modifies the DOM using normal methods, but .write() itself doesn't seem to notify DOM side, so no events are fired with .write().


2023-09-15
[20:54:21.0178] <annevk>
Ah that is correct, because the parser doesn't call mutation events.

[23:20:29.0110] <freddy>
thank you to all the note takers of yesterday's WHATWG sessions. was very easy to catch up on the stuff I missed 🙏

[02:36:57.0902] <annevk>
Joint session with a11y is starting. Minutes are still at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V6_s_VsaWcI9J-ZATbIKKijn59JbVmRMsHXYyH29sho/edit

[02:39:27.0558] <Panos Astithas>
Slides are here: https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/284#issuecomment-1720877381

[02:52:45.0764] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
do we have a generic term for the combination of a storage partition, network cache partition, etc.? as seen in ephemeral sessions in most implementations, for example.

[02:54:19.0401] <annevk>
Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]: we have a URL: https://privacycg.github.io/storage-partitioning/

[02:54:35.0328] <annevk>
I personally prefer "state partitioning", but I didn't actually rename all the things

[03:01:11.0739] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
a quick skim makes it sound like a "storage partition" is more than just that, it's more like (isPrivate, profile, site, origin) etc.?

[03:05:11.0889] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
like I guess I want something that covers (isPrivate, browserProfile), and then within that storage area you have further partitions (per site, etc.)?

[03:11:56.0876] <annevk>
Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]: I see, https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#user-agent made an attempt at that particular distinction

[03:12:19.0394] <annevk>
Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]: not sure it has everything you need, Jeffrey Yasskin might be able to help

[03:12:45.0293] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]: Yeah, I was trying to say that different profiles are entirely different user agents.

[03:12:57.0354] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
And then the user agent has various storage partitions.

[03:13:17.0265] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
Even if they co-exist in a single browser UI process?

[03:13:32.0410] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
Because that gives you multiple UAs in a single browser process, which seems… wild, terminology wise.

[03:14:27.0418] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
Yes, because the policies that control them could be very different, and no web-side information should flow between them. 

[03:15:13.0398] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
It's a spec construct, kinda like we abstract process boundaries into "agent clusters". So look at the observable implications, rather than assuming things about process boundaries.

[03:16:26.0402] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
It's also totally possible that I overlooked a bigger problem with that arrangement, so feel free to point that out. :)

[03:17:11.0788] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
(The context here is wanting to be able to have some control of, uh, user agents within an implementation under WebDriver BiDi. Which probably means refactoring a lot of the terminology in that spec.)

[03:17:58.0641] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
I think for WebDriver BiDi we're going to have to clarify when we're talking about the local end implementation, the remote end implementation, any intermediary node implementations, and the implementation [infra].

[03:18:14.0329] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
Cool, yeah, I wasn't thinking about the WebDriver implications when I wrote that. 

[03:19:45.0856] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
Does WebDriver want to make a single connection that covers multiple profiles? I would have expected that you'd make a WebDriver connection to a single profile, and so its spec could talk about connecting to an Infra user agent.

[03:20:04.0888] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
That is what the current WG discussion is about. 🙃

[03:20:21.0618] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
Do you want me to come over?

[03:20:41.0349] <Ms2ger>
[vaguely threatening]

[03:20:46.0041] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
lol

[03:20:50.0138] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
You're a bit too late. And probably mostly this is just a spec text question, rather than worthwhile having in the WG?

[03:21:39.0905] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
SG. Yeah, I hope the Infra term helps the WebDriver spec make all the relevant distinctions, and that any necessary spec changes actually make useful clarifications.

[03:21:44.0418] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
(CDP has this ability, and Puppeteer would like this to be possible with WebDriver BiDi, because it provides a decent performance win to avoid having to create a many new browsers while being able to run tests in parallel largely isolated.)

Hey guys! I've question... Do you know if Html 6 exists?


2023-09-18
[23:18:11.0707] <freddy>
Nope. HTML has moved towards a so-called "living standard" model. Implementors are supposed to continuously watch and keep up the HTML standard as is it evolves. The barrier is that pull requests to the HTML standard are gated by a rule that at least 2 of 3 major web engines (gecko, blink, webkit) need to agree and implement.

[23:18:41.0640] <freddy>
apropos, now that I visit html.spec.whatwg.org again, I also have a question -- what's special about the "Version for Web Devs" linked at the topo f the spec?

jarhar: making progress on https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8467#issuecomment-1693607442 would be great, it'd unblock WebKit working on it

[04:55:09.0120] <jarhar>
sure thing, ill try to work on this hopefully today or this week

[05:12:41.0842] <annevk>
littledan: not sure if you're still interested in doing more with text and canvas, but perhaps helping with ensuring existing issues such as https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5826 get resolved would help pave the way there; if we can't even get what little text support we have today to work well I'd be rather worried about anything more complex than that

[07:41:27.0607] <littledan>
Thanks, sounds like a good starting project. I will see if we can get started on this in January

jarhar: The http://wpt.live/html/semantics/forms/the-button-element/button-submit-remove-children.html times out in WebKit because (as far as I can see) the `load` event never fires at the iframe that’s the target of the form action in that test. Any clue as to why the event never fires?

[19:24:31.0328] <jarhar>
hmm, the fact that im not seeing a 404 page in the iframe makes me wonder if webkit legitimately fails this test

[19:25:21.0106] <jarhar>
i wrote this test in response to one of many regression bugs that were filed when i did a refactor to form submission

[19:26:17.0700] <jarhar>
i wrote it here: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1983547

[19:26:31.0581] <sideshowbarker>
I see

[19:27:52.0067] <jarhar>
lol this was really complicated, but i suppose you could try implementing this patch in webkit to see if it makes the test pass

[19:29:10.0587] <sideshowbarker>
Yeah I'll try it I guess

[19:32:09.0980] <sideshowbarker>
This is the only complete fail in WebKit in https://wpt.fyi/results/html/semantics/forms/the-button-element — so, would be nice to make it all go green

[19:33:06.0712] <sideshowbarker>
that said, there is also https://wpt.fyi/results/html/semantics/forms/the-button-element/button-click-submits.html, which has a test that fails both in Blink and WebKit (but not in Gecko)

[20:29:39.0868] <sideshowbarker>
OK, ported that patch but in WebKit, still timing out anyway.

[20:30:11.0881] <sideshowbarker>
so I guess for now I’ll put this test on the back burner and look at it more again some time later

[23:53:10.0455] <annevk>
Domenic: can you review the encoding-parse a URL refactor?

[23:53:26.0420] <annevk>
Would be nice to unblock some of the follow-up work

[00:35:24.0687] <Noam Rosenthal>
zcorpan: regarding the media/supports thing, I felt it was a bit inconsistent that in CSS those are separate @ rules and in the link element they are both folded into the `media` attribute. perhaps there's a more elegant solution?

[00:36:56.0169] <zcorpan>
Noam Rosenthal: perhaps. We want it to fail closed, so that the stylesheet isn't applied in legacy browsers. (But maybe the importance of this property is debatable, since it's temporary and we have faster update cycles now compared to, say, a decade ago)

[00:37:34.0820] <Noam Rosenthal>
... I would expect it to be in a separate cssSupports attribute, and deal with legacy in a way that's a bit more consistent with the meaning of the attributes

[00:39:25.0425] <zcorpan>
Ways to fail closed other than stuffing it in `media` (and still work in `head`): change `rel` to something else (seems not so elegant long term), use `type` attribute (should ideally be possible to not have to write `text/css` since we made that optional)

[00:41:37.0425] <zcorpan>
Maybe we can use a new attribute and in the transition period people can use `media="not all"` and change that with script (or use other rel/type to avoid the download)

[00:41:42.0851] <Noam Rosenthal>
For now there is a convenient way to do this:
```
<style>
   @import url("...") supports(...);
</style>
```

I wonder if making the media attribute inconsistent is worth it

[00:42:01.0915] <zcorpan>
good point

[00:42:06.0442] <Noam Rosenthal>
I didn't quite get if adding this as a link provides anything material

[00:42:47.0456] <zcorpan>
It might be loaded earlier by the speculative parser. Not sure if all browsers speculatively load `@import`s

[00:43:03.0905] <Noam Rosenthal>
they don't in chrome AFAIK

[00:45:12.0923] <Noam Rosenthal>
I think adding a `rel=css` or `rel=style` which can take `layer` and `cssSupports` attributes is not that bad, and when everyone supports layers we can make them aliases of each other

[00:46:56.0364] <Noam Rosenthal>
I mean it's not that pretty but it's at least straightforward in a way

[00:47:40.0905] <zcorpan>
I don't like adding alias `rel`s, but I'm warming up to just adding `supports` attribute and let it fail open in legacy. Use `style` element or script hack if you need to fail closed

[00:48:29.0212] <zcorpan>
The linked stylesheet can repeat the `@supports` too if you can control what it contains

[00:49:18.0371] <Noam Rosenthal>
yea that's probably safer, you use the supports attribute as an optimization to avoid loading the link at all rather than as a way to not apply the CSS

[00:55:29.0145] <sideshowbarker>
At https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#standard-metadata-names:meta-color-scheme, the spec normatively states this:
> _There must not be more than one `meta` element with its `name` attribute value set to an ASCII case-insensitive match for `color-scheme` per document._
But then later has this non-normative note that says this:
> _Because these rules check successive elements until they find a match, an author can provide multiple such values to handle fallback for legacy user agents. Opposite to how CSS fallback works for properties, the multiple meta elements needs to be arranged with the legacy values after the newer values._
So, that note seems to conflict with the normative requirements — by implying that using multiple elements is OK (or even sort of a best practice).

 * At https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#standard-metadata-names:meta-color-scheme, the spec normatively states this:

> _There must not be more than one `meta` element with its `name` attribute value set to an ASCII case-insensitive match for `color-scheme` per document._

But then later has this non-normative note that says this:

> _Because these rules check successive elements until they find a match, an author can provide multiple such values to handle fallback for legacy user agents. Opposite to how CSS fallback works for properties, the multiple meta elements needs to be arranged with the legacy values after the newer values._

So, that note seems to conflict with the normative requirements — by implying that using multiple elements is OK (or even sort of a best practice).

(There’s also a grammar error in the note.)

[01:01:23.0166] <sideshowbarker>
The HTML spec text doesn’t explicitly state that the `color-scheme` value can be an ordered list of keywords — instead it just says, “The value must be a string that matches the syntax for the CSS '[`color-scheme`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-adjust/#color-scheme-prop)' property value” — where `color-scheme` is a link/reference to the normative CSS definition for the property value (which says the value is _“the keyword `normal`, or an ordered list of specified color scheme keywords”_

[01:02:23.0706] <sideshowbarker>
So, maybe that note about using using multiple elements was written without an understanding that the value could be a _list_ of keywords rather than a single keyword?

Regardless, the note seems wrong.

Not sure. I think it depends on what the CSS parser does and what the CSS spec requires UAs to do

[01:12:24.0560] <zcorpan>
oh no, the grammar allows custom-ident

[01:17:15.0777] <zcorpan>
so parsing would only fail if you use e.g. a function. which seems unlikely to be added, so I think we can just remove the note

[01:18:47.0656] <sideshowbarker>
> <@zcorpan:mozilla.org> so parsing would only fail if you use e.g. a function. which seems unlikely to be added, so I think we can just remove the note

OK, I reckon I’ll open a PR

[01:19:23.0849] <zcorpan>
maybe even the processing could stop after the first meta element even if it fails, but also, if the current processing is implemented already, not worth it to shake

[01:23:49.0225] <sideshowbarker>
yeah

[01:43:07.0824] <Noam Rosenthal>
zcorpan: another option for backwards compat if we really want the link element, is to have a new attribute like `cssConditions` or so that can accept a `@media ... @supports` style syntax and overrides `media`. So you use `media="not all"` like you suggested before, and in browsers that supports this attribute you'd get the media+supports check (plus whatever check we allow in the future)

[01:46:09.0885] <zcorpan>
Noam Rosenthal: interesting idea. personally I prefer the html attribute syntax

[01:47:35.0032] <zcorpan>
also would be surprising that `media` is ignored here:
```html
<link rel=stylesheet cssconditions="supports(at-rule(@scope))" media="print">
```

[01:47:57.0636] <Noam Rosenthal>
we can ignore it only if `cssconditions` contains media

[01:48:05.0184] <Noam Rosenthal>
 * we can choose ignore it only if `cssconditions` contains media

[01:48:59.0240] <zcorpan>
seems more convoluted to explain than `supports=""`

[01:49:27.0680] <zcorpan>
+ more typing

[01:49:50.0041] <zcorpan>
 * plus more typing

[01:50:07.0002] <zcorpan>
(didn't know starting a line with + made a bullet list)

[01:50:20.0320] <Noam Rosenthal>
sure, but also has some pros as it lets us use the link element earlier

[01:50:39.0558] <Noam Rosenthal>
not sure if it's worth it but thought I'd try to bring an alternative

[01:52:58.0813] <zcorpan>
Maybe we can solve that socially. have a comment in the spec for import conditions to also change the link element

[01:56:13.0824] <Noam Rosenthal>
I don't follow :)

[02:10:28.0888] <zcorpan>
Noam Rosenthal: you said " it lets us use the link element earlier", but that's only true if `@import` gains a new feature first, instead of the `link` element gaining that feature first, or they gain it at the same time

[04:21:26.0711] <sideshowbarker>
I mean in terms of the spec requirements at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-sequences.html#fully-active:
> A [Document](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#document) d is said to be fully active when d is the [active document](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-sequences.html#nav-document) of a [navigable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-sequences.html#navigable) navigable, and either navigable is a [top-level traversable](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-sequences.html#top-level-traversable) or navigable's [container document](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-sequences.html#nav-container-document) is [fully active](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-sequences.html#fully-active).

[04:23:36.0273] <sideshowbarker>
…so `childDoc` must either (a) not be the active document of a navigable, or (b) the navigable is not a top-level traversable, or (c) the navigable’s container document is not fully active.

[04:45:39.0366] <annevk>

Are SVG elements with an id attribute supposed to be exposed as named properties on the window? The section on named properties for the window object says that that should be "HTML Elements" with an id content attribute, which points to a definition that says "elements in the xhtml namespace"

See https://platform.html5.org/history/webapps/r4636.html#context-menus — not as far as current work, but just as far as what the spec once had before it was eventually removed (due to lack of implementor interest).

Reaching outside the content area and contributing items to the browser's context menu is a new capability. yuzus, tkent and I are not on the capabilities part of the team; they are busy bringing web developers other new capabilities. They should be heavily involved in the decision to implement this but they can't right now.

Euh, XML doesn't define what to do with `data:text/xml,<?xml%20version="1.0"%20encoding="a"?><b/>`? Five editions!

(Tracked in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18110 for now.)

[03:01:29.0298] <sideshowbarker>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> sideshowbarker: I'm not sure that's accurate, relevant Document is childFrame.contentDocument, which is non-null, right?

Yeah, seems so — and that’s also what I had thought, but WebKit is the only UA to have implemented that spec change, and WebKit returns `about:blank` there. So it appears to be a bug in WebKit, caused by the Location code not having the Frame object that it should have.

Take a look at https://searchfox.org/wubkat/source/Source/WebCore/page/Location.cpp#53-54. That entire code assumes there’s a single `frame()` Frame object that it gets the location from. But for that test case, it’s null. So I guess changing  the `src` value of that iframe either causes the `childDoc` to be prematurely completely disassociated from `childFrame`, or else that `childFrame` gets prematurely destroyed.

[03:13:01.0952] <annevk>
Does anyone know how you find out if indexing a spec got stuck? XHR still doesn't pick up terms we introduced in HTML two days ago.

[03:13:09.0307] <annevk>
TabAtkins maybe?

[03:14:29.0456] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: are you saying `Frame` is 1:1 with `Document`? I'm not familiar with how this stuff is implemented in browsers unfortunately.

> <@annevk:matrix.org> sideshowbarker: are you saying `Frame` is 1:1 with `Document`? I'm not familiar with how this stuff is implemented in browsers unfortunately.

I don’t know — I need to trace through the rest of the code more. But code-wise, I see that Location code has access to a LocalDOMWindow window, along with access to that frame() Frame, and naïvely I wonder if it should be getting the document from that LocalDOMWindow object rather the Frame.

Anyway, if I can’t get it figured out, I’ll raise a bugs.webkit.org bug.

The failing test case is at https://wpt.fyi/results/html/webappapis/dynamic-markup-insertion/opening-the-input-stream/url.window.html

[05:42:59.0038] <sideshowbarker>
annevk: If I make a change to the Location-handling code in WebKit (specifically, to the `Location::url()` code), what WPT tests should I check for regressions?

I just locally ran all 926 tests in the `html/webappapis` and `html/browsers` subtrees. Are there WPT subtrees in addition to those that I should also run and look at results for?

[05:50:44.0923] <emilio>
annevk: sorry for the [massive comment](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9546#issuecomment-1729500041) in the switch issue :/

[05:51:06.0049] <emilio>
annevk: but I think it's important we get these details right to avoid the kind of mess we're in with some of the other form controls

[06:51:41.0410] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: that seems about right

[06:54:38.0747] <annevk>
emilio: that's very useful, thanks!

[06:59:01.0570] <annevk>
emilio: I'll do some more investigation. Might take a while. If zcorpan has some notes somewhere from when he investigated all this for `<input type=checkbox>` that might be useful too.

Ideally I'd like to tackle this in stages, but there should be sufficient information for each stage and earlier design decisions shouldn't cause us to run into issues later on.

[07:01:48.0482] <zcorpan>
IIRC I didn't investigate checkboxes so much

[07:03:57.0590] <annevk>
zcorpan: it's not too late 😅

[07:05:17.0946] <zcorpan>
annevk: it never is :)

[09:54:20.0537] <zcorpan>
annevk: implementer interest or opposition for webkit? https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9538

[10:06:56.0054] <annevk>
zcorpan: support, made me remember to actually label https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/86 properly

[10:34:44.0686] <sideshowbarker>
annevk: will see what Chris says about https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/18026. I don’t yet understand exactly that the `Frame` abstraction maps to in the spec — but whatever its purpose, it seems like the code can and should just be using the available Window instead. And the test results also seem to indicate that’s what should be happening.

[12:42:38.0169] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> Jeffrey Yasskin: Noam Rosenthal: I gave it another pass; things that could help in the future: ensure Build is passing, commit message is clear, checklist in OP is filled out, there's a PR somewhere for renaming tentative tests to non-tentative tests; if either of you wants to review it as well that'd be appreciated

Thanks annevk and Noam Rosenthal! I've sent https://github.com/whatwg/spec-factory/pull/48 to try to reduce the chance that we miss those things again in the future.

[08:53:52.0976] <Alexander Kalenik>
hi, I am trying to find out where Window's associated document needs to be set/updated. So far I found that specification defines "11. Set window's associated Document to document." in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-lifecycle.html#initialise-the-document-object

is that actually the only place where associated document should be set? shouldn't it also be set for document created alongside the browsing context here https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/document-sequences.html#creating-a-new-browsing-context ?


2023-09-24
[20:16:10.0295] <Domenic>
Hmm, maybe a bug. I think https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#make-active used to set the associated Document, but doesn't anymore?

[00:06:11.0419] <vrafaeli>
I don't know what is going on when you have nested forms https://codesandbox.io/s/nested-forms-9zgg4x?file=/src/App.js:717-722

[00:08:01.0597] <vrafaeli>
Try submitting the inner form and observe what happens. I know that having nested forms is not really according to specs (I don't know why) but something strange happens. I also tried e.stopPropagation() and the same happens.

[01:15:00.0276] <Noam Rosenthal>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Hmm, maybe a bug. I think https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsing-the-web.html#make-active used to set the associated Document, but doesn't anymore?

Yea also seems like a bug to me, trying to follow the links...

[01:37:11.0111] <Noam Rosenthal>
vrafaeli: nested forms are not spec-compilant and have all kind of incompatible behavior across browsers. Unexpected behavior sounds like something you should be expecting.

[02:27:23.0702] <vrafaeli>
Ok. What is the reason for nested forms not being allowed by the spec?

[05:29:38.0527] <Noam Rosenthal>
vrafaeli: I wasn't there but AFAIK it's a very old thing (HTML3?)... like many things in the web platform, trying to change the behavior at this point would make an even bigger mess. The `form` attribute on input elements provides an alternative that should be sufficient.

[06:58:15.0618] <sideshowbarker>
> <@vrafaeli:matrix.org> Ok. What is the reason for nested forms not being allowed by the spec?

FWIW the HTML checker does catch that and attempt to provide a helpful message:
> _Saw a form start tag, but there was already an active form element. Nested forms are not allowed. Ignoring the tag._

I also don’t know why nested forms aren’t allowed. But if we can find an explanation and write it up somewhere, I could make the _“Nested forms are not allowed”_ text in that message into a hyperlink to the explanation.

And I guess the best place for the explanation would be as a non-normative Note in the HTML spec itself.

[11:57:46.0483] <vrafaeli>
sideshowbarker: FWIW the HTML checker does catch that and attempt to provide a helpful message:

Yea I noticed that

If folks have thoughts on what our READMEs for standards should look like, I'd welcome them here: https://github.com/whatwg/spec-factory/pull/49


2023-09-26
[20:40:13.0898] <martin>
The HTML spec currently [contains the following sentence](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#insert-an-html-element):

> When the steps below require the user agent to **insert an HTML element** for a token, the user agent must **insert a foreign element** for the token, in the HTML namespace.

(emphasis mine)

I think it's rather confusing for the "insert a foreign element" procedure to be called that when it is also used for non-foreign elements. I think it would make more sense for it to just be called "insert an element". What do you think about this?

[22:28:17.0242] <annevk>
martin: I think that's a reasonable rename. mfreed is touching that step in the declarative shadow tree PR so maybe we don't want to rename it until after that lands.

[23:27:51.0491] <Noam Rosenthal>
zcorpan, annevk I want to proceed on the reveal/readytorender event we discussed at TPAC for view-transitions (https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9315). seems like there was rough consensus about the direction, I want to see we're ok with the details

[00:37:23.0907] <sideshowbarker>
annevk: About `<link disabled>`, can you point me to the specific step in https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/ that requires setting the owner node to null?

I’m not questioning it — I just want to add a spec link to the commit message for https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/17001

And I’m specifically looking at the part of the test case at https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/cssom/HTMLLinkElement-disabled-002.html#L26

[01:02:49.0884] <annevk>
Domenic: I was hoping you could have a look at https://github.com/whatwg/spec-factory/pull/34 too; it's old but still relevant

[01:03:45.0815] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: I don't see it in https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#the-stylesheet-interface and I think emilio wrote those tests, so maybe he can elaborate

[01:10:22.0069] <emilio>
sideshowbarker: annevk: Seems like a bug in the CSSOM spec. The ownerNode is mutable, and goes away when the node -> sheet link goes away. E.g., this interoperably logs `<style>` then `null`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<style>div {}</style>
<script>
  let sheet = document.querySelector("style").sheet;
  console.log(sheet);
  console.log(sheet.ownerNode);
  sheet.ownerNode.remove();
  console.log(sheet.ownerNode);
</script>
```

[01:17:10.0402] <annevk>
emilio: I think that specific scenario is covered by https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#remove-a-css-style-sheet

[01:18:40.0384] <annevk>
I think the problem is that there's no equivalent logic around disabling

Yeah maybe I should put some more links there now I know how that looks

[02:30:26.0054] <sideshowbarker>
The inline chat link in the new issue template is great too

[02:30:53.0847] <sideshowbarker>
And the required _“What problem are you trying to solve?”_ field (in the new-feature template)

[02:34:33.0432] <annevk>
"What would you say you do here?"

[03:44:37.0168] <sideshowbarker>
So 20 years ago this month is when Hixie published the first version of what would eventually lead to “HTML5” and the modern HTML spec http://www.hixie.ch/specs/html/forms/hfp.html (titled _“XHTML Module: Extensions to Form Controls”_)

[03:47:18.0431] <annevk>
I vaguely recall a declarative version of http://www.hixie.ch/specs/html/forms/hfp.html#TOC51

[03:48:20.0739] <sideshowbarker>
Maybe that came later? somewhere in https://platform.html5.org/history/

[03:59:32.0479] <sideshowbarker>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> I think the problem is that there's no equivalent logic around disabling

emilio: You able to make time to update the CSSOM spec to add a _“disable a CSS stylesheet”_ algorithm? (Assuming you’re still the current editor.) Also I guess the HTML spec would need to be updated too, to add a call site to that new algorithm — at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-link-element:attr-link-disabled-2 I suppose?

Or else I can try to write up a patch for it myself. Lemme know

[04:00:52.0558] <annevk>
I don't see it in the history, but https://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#repeatingFormControls has it. I think Opera supported something like it at one point.

[04:19:55.0936] <zcorpan>

[04:20:22.0932] <zcorpan>

hi i have a problem with a site that i've made. it works great on chrome but it doesnt work on firefox. i have a html form and the data is stored in a json file. when the user has paid the file goes to a php file and the data is taken from the json file. but when i try this in firefox it doesnt work i get this TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource

[05:00:05.0977] <annevk>
zcorpan: that's defined, yes, remove a style sheet is called; but there's nothing like that for enabling/disabling

[05:00:32.0745] <zcorpan>
annevk: what's the difference?

[05:00:43.0976] <annevk>
anouk s: that's prolly better suited for Stack Overflow (and you'll need to provide more details there)

[05:01:29.0182] <zcorpan>
Maybe enabling again doesn't create a new stylesheet

[05:04:47.0556] <zcorpan>
Ian Hickson: saving in live dom viewer seems to give an internal error

[05:05:30.0176] <zcorpan>

onload = () => {
var sheet = x.sheet;
w(document.styleSheets.length)
x.disabled = true;
w(sheet.ownerNode)
w(document.styleSheets.length)
x.disabled = false;
w(sheet === x.sheet);
}

thank you i'm going over there. hopefully they can help me

keithamus: if there's some secret syntax by which you can omit the label from the output let me know, https://github.com/annevk/temp-whatwg-new-issue/issues/2 is a little ugly given there's only one input field in the end but workable 

[06:43:47.0761] <annevk>
As in, I'd prefer "What is the issue?" not to be there

[06:50:30.0445] <keithamus>

[11:27:39.0089] <annevk>
One thing I realized with the `new/choose` URL is that we probably want to link there directly rather than link to `new`. It would also break zcorpan's script, though we might be able to make that work still.

[17:50:17.0246] <sideshowbarker>
Dominic Farolino: Isn't https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1706 likely to break some percentage of sites that are currently relying on browsers not doing a preflight?

[17:56:50.0223] <sideshowbarker>
> <@akaster:serenityos.org> Is a null "origin or null" same origin with another null "origin or null"?

I think a null origin is by definition a unique origin that doesn't match any other origin — including any other null origin. HTML uses “opaque origin” to help make that more clear (no pun intended)

[18:00:24.0113] <ljharb>
sounds more like a NaN origin (half-serious)

I made some edits, PTAL. I'm OK omitting the StackOverflow link I added, not sure it's worth it.

[21:36:33.0549] <sideshowbarker>
Domenic: For some reason, the order is different on mobile: 

[21:37:01.0431] <Domenic>
Oh dear...

[21:37:08.0724] <sideshowbarker>
Maybe having Chat and StackOverflow first that way is actually better, I dunno

[21:37:09.0347] <Domenic>
Is that a result of my renames?

[21:37:15.0325] <Domenic>
Or is it an existing bug?

[21:37:45.0031] <sideshowbarker>
I don’t think it was the result of your renames — but I also don’t remember what the order was previously

[21:39:42.0785] <sideshowbarker>
anyway, I think we should keep the Stack Overflow link — because it’s helpful but also because we’d still be using up only ~2/3rds of the vertical space on a mobile screen, so users wouldn’t need to scroll to see anything. And it’d leave us plenty of room to add more links later, if/when we think of other stuff

[21:41:01.0891] <sideshowbarker>
nit: I think Stack Overflow is two words rather than one camelcased

[21:45:08.0629] <Domenic>
Fixed, thanks

[21:51:12.0853] <sideshowbarker>
and for the Stack Overflow text maybe something more like:
> _If you're having a problem with your frontend code, this is probably not the right place to get help. Consider asking on Stack Overflow instead. This issue tracker is for bugs and questions about the Foo standard itself, and feature requests._

[22:10:54.0999] <sideshowbarker>
Domenic: for the _New issue_ template, maybe we should also have:
- Add a new required **Spec section URL** as the first input field, with the guidance text being something like:
  > _Which specific section of the Foo spec are you reporting this issue against?_
- In place of the “What is the issue?” label, instead something like:
  > _What information in the spec was incorrect, incomplete, or otherwise in need of being updated?_


[22:12:02.0235] <sideshowbarker>
…with part of the purpose being to preempt people filing issues that aren’t directly related to the content of the spec itself, but instead should be asked in Stack Overflow or somewhere.

[22:13:48.0137] <sideshowbarker>
…because if someone is unable to provide a URL for a spec section, and unable to identify a particular section of the spec that has a problem, and to describe what the specific problem is in the spec, then it’s likely not a spec issue

[22:17:29.0412] <sideshowbarker>
and a bonus would be that the spec URL could be used to automatically label the issue based on what spec section it’s about — for example, in the case of the HTML spec, the appropriate `topic:` label from https://github.com/whatwg/html/labels?q=topic%3A

[22:18:43.0166] <Domenic>
Oh, I like that idea. annevk , thoughts?

I worry a bit about making filing an issue overly laborious. Rephrasing the question seems reasonable, but I'm not sure about requiring a URL. Although having an optional URL field might be okay and could be used when we refactor zcorpan's script. (Of course, at that point my feature request to GitHub becomes moot too.)

[22:27:33.0872] <annevk>
Domenic: I guess you should do the newline thing on the New issue template too

[22:28:50.0580] <annevk>
(Opaque origin can sometimes be reused and it is same origin with itself so it's not quite like NaN I think.)

[22:30:32.0491] <Domenic>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> Domenic: I guess you should do the newline thing on the New issue template too

There's only one paragraph there so it's not needed.

[23:27:26.0349] <annevk>
Domenic: it has the same newline separating the Chat line

[23:30:25.0196] <Domenic>
Ah I see, it just linebreaked at exactly the right place.

[23:31:45.0491] <Domenic>
Done

[00:18:03.0299] <zcorpan>
Is it a problem that people are filing issues that aren't spec issues?

[00:22:23.0863] <annevk>
zcorpan: kinda

[00:23:45.0773] <annevk>
zcorpan: I think especially for HTML there's quite a bit of noise and at the same time not enough information for people who want to help fix things

[00:30:29.0210] <zcorpan>
annevk: ok yeah then maybe the template can ask for more details

[01:29:34.0305] <annevk>
Domenic: https://github.com/whatwg/url/pull/794 \o/

[01:29:53.0168] <Domenic>
Nice!

[01:32:14.0592] <annevk>
I guess I'll create the remainder of PRs automatically and then if any need additional work I'll find out through self-review

[01:32:38.0662] <Noam Rosenthal>
Domenic: what happens to NavigationHistoryEntry on location.replace()? I am afraid that if we use history entries directly for the activation info we might lose some info 

[01:33:18.0365] <annevk>
I'll land this URL one first and give it until after lunch at least before doing the remainder, just in case

[01:33:39.0249] <Domenic>
They get replaced with a new NavigationHistoryEntry

[01:34:03.0240] <Domenic>
This API would actually be the first time you could see a replaced entry

[01:34:24.0572] <Domenic>
Which we have for some time noted as a vaguely good idea to solve

[01:34:52.0430] <Domenic>
https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api/issues/41

[01:38:35.0610] <annevk>
Okay, so currently "file issue about the selected text" bypasses the template. But it still works. We can look into fixing that, but given how seldom it's used I'm motivated enough to do it myself.

Folks here might enjoy hober's https://tess.oconnor.cx/2023/09/polyglots-and-interoperability (if you make the time, maybe also budget some time for the cross-references, I especially enjoyed Ian Hickson's email referenced in the footnote about namespace prefixes)

[02:35:46.0962] <Ms2ger>
"something too terrible to actually use can be fixed by adding a level of indirection", I like that

[02:40:29.0904] <Noam Rosenthal>
Domenic: re https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9760, coming to think that the whole thing about activation info is a almost an entirely different use case from "initial load". I wonder if "initial load" has use-cases other than manipulating the spinner?

[02:43:11.0404] <annevk>
Hah, the most popular "whatwg" repo is node-fetch: https://github.com/topics/whatwg. That is kinda funny.

[02:44:25.0912] <annevk>
And Observable is more popular than Web IDL. Good times.

[03:50:38.0871] <sideshowbarker>
I guess we need to buy some more github stars

[08:18:30.0508] <Jeremy Roman>
time to make deprecate WebIDL and describe all APIs in terms of Observable

[08:18:53.0748] <Jeremy Roman>
If you want to know what the width of your canvas is, just subscribe to it once :)

[08:24:31.0801] <annevk>
dbaron: I think you should now have sufficient access for labels and reviewers and such; if it's still not working I can give you write access on some repositories if you want (still won't give you direct access to main, but would allow you to meddle with other people's PRs; up to you whether you want such power)

[08:27:08.0204] <annevk>
If everyone observed it, but nobody subscribed, did it really happen?

[08:54:24.0794] <annevk>
miketaylr: you get the honor of deploying the last set of issue templates (and fixing a Build error): https://github.com/whatwg/compat/pull/247 🎉

[09:01:34.0892] <freddy>
annevk:  I'm looking at potential interop isues where I know that Chrome is using an internal redirect but Firefox is replacing the request's URL scheme (s/HTTP/HTTPS), but I'm still not fully sure what an internal redirect is and how that is web-exposed. As the person who field https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1426, - Can you help me come up with a test case or a specific scenario where that would be web-observable?

[09:02:46.0186] <freddy>
I a test that redirects 14 times + internal redirect would get you to 15 redirects (is that still the max?) and return a NetworkError, where a scheme-replacement wouldnt. But surely that isn't in the categories of interesting scenarios? :)

[09:03:11.0779] <annevk>
freddy: that's actually a scenario we have an issue on

[09:03:56.0735] <annevk>
freddy: limit is 20 per https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-http-redirect-fetch

[09:05:08.0196] <annevk>
freddy: actually replacing it would also update a Request object I think, which doesn't make any sense

[09:06:24.0875] <annevk>
freddy: an internal redirect is essentially where you go to the network layer and the network layer gives you a new location and then you do policy checks against that (hopefully correctly, but often we've had bugs) and tell the network layer to go fetch it

[09:07:34.0285] <annevk>
freddy: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/576

[09:09:14.0841] <freddy>
Ah, so the "fetch" abstraction should treats it as a redirect that needs to be subject to additional security checks?

[09:09:42.0814] <freddy>
I suppose in a "switch the target to HTTPS" you wouldn't want to check the CSP (and cause violations for a request that was browser-modified and not issued by the page)?

[09:10:11.0329] <freddy>
I'll need to think about that some more. Unfortunately, I have to end my work for today.

[09:11:03.0164] <annevk>
freddy: or bypass certain checks such as CSP and CORS

[09:12:18.0951] <annevk>
freddy: I guess the main reason why it's done is because you can't always make these decisions synchronously and the network layer has access to the relevant information; Fetch doesn't really have the same limitation/interface, but we do kinda want the initial request URL not to be mutated, but we could solve that in other ways too

[09:13:18.0019] <annevk>
(Clearly, I should also take a break.)

Ian Hickson: please fix live DOM viewer :). Or open source it somewhere so we can host our own.

[20:23:59.0873] <Domenic>
(Save button is broken.)

[00:07:08.0474] <freddy>
In the meantime, I like https://livedom.bentkowski.info/ a lot. It's got a "share URL" feature but that just throws the whole input into a URL parameter which might be a bit long and unwieldy

[00:16:52.0892] <annevk>
keithamus: I'm not sure I understand https://github.com/whatwg/fullscreen/issues/124#issuecomment-1738125683, but it also seems like something that is better raised with the CSS WG?

[00:18:17.0650] <keithamus>
Sure, I can raise it there. I was mostly +1ing and adding what I thought would be useful context. 

[00:42:54.0715] <annevk>
johannhof: Noam Rosenthal: should Set-Cookie be honored on 101 (current answer is yes), 103 (current answer is no), and other 1xx responses (current answer is no)? I'll open an issue against Fetch for this because I don't think we have fully considered it.

[00:46:38.0717] <annevk>
https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1710

[01:00:43.0656] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: I wonder how this is used in 101 for Websockets or whatnot... my immediate intuition would be that 1xx responses setting cookies would be a violation of them being "informational"

[01:01:27.0573] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I see you are not familiar with our topic :p

[01:02:21.0410] <annevk>
More seriously, I'm not sure. I know there's at least a WebKit test for this.

[01:02:51.0082] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: you mean "leave your sense of logic out the door"? yes, familiar with it... hence "I wonder". I don't have a concrete input into this, let me do some research.

[01:04:29.0362] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I also wonder what happens in practice for 103 today. Perhaps browsers match Fetch, but maybe only half of them do or some such.

[01:07:47.0198] <annevk>
Domenic: I thought we had resolved on https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9797 at some point. But maybe I'm missing something. smaug could you confirm/deny my assertions in that issue?

[01:24:56.0976] <sideshowbarker>
annevk: given that for 3xx response with no Location header but with a response body, the Fetch spec doesn’t explicitly prohibit UAs from processing the response body, and given that there’s also nothing in HTML that prohibits it either, I guess that means UAs can choose to do whichever they want with it (process it or not)?

…and lacking any spec requirements around it, it’s not something that can be expected to necessarily behave interoperably?

[01:26:24.0556] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: no, then something would have to be explicitly indicated as implementation-defined

[01:26:58.0578] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: in this case the response would be returned to the caller as-is, so if you emit a 309 on the server, that's what the caller would see

[01:27:28.0852] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: that even holds when there is a Location header, as that's only defined to have meaning for a redirect response, which 309 is not

[01:27:40.0033] <sideshowbarker>
OK

[01:28:33.0063] <sideshowbarker>
well the specific context is https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=262030 and trying to decide how to resolve that

[01:30:03.0732] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#default-fetch-and-process-the-linked-resource suggests that most link elements require an ok status, which means those would end up being rejected

[01:30:58.0689] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: stylesheet uses those default steps it seems

[01:33:28.0252] <sideshowbarker>
ah OK

[01:33:58.0268] <sideshowbarker>
thanks much
