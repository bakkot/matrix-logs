Domenic: mind if I reach out to Mike and Artur for that module worker issue? Or perhaps you already have?

[00:45:29.0144] <Domenic>
annevk: go for it

Luca Casonato: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9668 does Deno need an issue for this?

smaug: I've tried to make the commit title clearer, will use that when landing

thanks. Initially when I just saw the bugmail I thought it was about some script bundling and workers 🙂

Hey annevkI’ll do this one:

 * Hey annevkI’ll do issue 7374. It’s in the HTML repo

[23:52:12.0529] <annevk>
Christine Belzie: sounds good, but https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7374 appears closed?

HTML tables have a defined schema, table -> tbody -> tr -> td
Is there a way for the row to behave like an <a> element, in a way that the row's link can be copied, or opened in a new tab with ctrl+click.

[05:00:44.0920] <vrafaeli>
Or is this just a bad UX, and a table row should have a column where the link is in?

vrafaeli: with scripting you can accomplish some if not all of that, but there's no way with just markup. Might be an interesting feature request for CSS to let a row act as the link of one of its columns
