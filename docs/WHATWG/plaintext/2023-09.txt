Domenic: mind if I reach out to Mike and Artur for that module worker issue? Or perhaps you already have?

[00:45:29.0144] <Domenic>
annevk: go for it

Luca Casonato: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9668 does Deno need an issue for this?

smaug: I've tried to make the commit title clearer, will use that when landing

thanks. Initially when I just saw the bugmail I thought it was about some script bundling and workers ðŸ™‚

Hey annevkIâ€™ll do this one:

 * Hey annevkIâ€™ll do issue 7374. Itâ€™s in the HTML repo

[23:52:12.0529] <annevk>
Christine Belzie: sounds good, but https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7374 appears closed?

HTML tables have a defined schema, table -> tbody -> tr -> td
Is there a way for the row to behave like an <a> element, in a way that the row's link can be copied, or opened in a new tab with ctrl+click.

[05:00:44.0920] <vrafaeli>
Or is this just a bad UX, and a table row should have a column where the link is in?

Or would this just be a bad UX, and a table row should just have a column where the link is in?

[07:11:04.0720] <annevk>
vrafaeli: with scripting you can accomplish some if not all of that, but there's no way with just markup. Might be an interesting feature request for CSS to let a row act as the link of one of its columns

I have been designing web sites since 1993.  I started out with NCSA Mosaic and websites implemented on NCSA httpd.  I am tired of being forced to use JavaScript as the only way to implement dynamic functionality on web pages.  IMHO Brendan Eich only invented it as a temporary measure.  His exploitation of the Java trademark suggests to me that he expected the compiled Java language to eventually replace it, once the appropriate libraries were constructed.  Back in the 90s I wrote Java Applets and even taught a course on them.  But Java has been removed from all browsers "Because of the removal of older NPAPI plugins on which Java is built on."  But that was only one implementation of the Java VM.
