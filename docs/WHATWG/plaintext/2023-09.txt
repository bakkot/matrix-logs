how to fix Insecure CORS Configuration?

[00:45:17.0288] <annevk>
Domenic: mind if I reach out to Mike and Artur for that module worker issue? Or perhaps you already have?

[00:45:29.0144] <Domenic>
annevk: go for it

Luca Casonato: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9668 does Deno need an issue for this?

[04:10:25.0657] <annevk>
smaug: I've tried to make the commit title clearer, will use that when landing

[04:11:19.0483] <smaug>
thanks. Initially when I just saw the bugmail I thought it was about some script bundling and workers ðŸ™‚

Hey annevkIâ€™ll do this one:

 * Hey annevkIâ€™ll do issue 7374. Itâ€™s in the HTML repo

[23:52:12.0529] <annevk>
Christine Belzie: sounds good, but https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7374 appears closed?

HTML tables have a defined schema, table -> tbody -> tr -> td
Is there a way for the row to behave like an <a> element, in a way that the row's link can be copied, or opened in a new tab with ctrl+click.

[05:00:44.0920] <vrafaeli>
Or is this just a bad UX, and a table row should have a column where the link is in?

Or would this just be a bad UX, and a table row should just have a column where the link is in?

[07:11:04.0720] <annevk>
vrafaeli: with scripting you can accomplish some if not all of that, but there's no way with just markup. Might be an interesting feature request for CSS to let a row act as the link of one of its columns

I have been designing web sites since 1993.  I started out with NCSA Mosaic and websites implemented on NCSA httpd.  I am tired of being forced to use JavaScript as the only way to implement dynamic functionality on web pages.  IMHO Brendan Eich only invented it as a temporary measure.  His exploitation of the Java trademark suggests to me that he expected the compiled Java language to eventually replace it, once the appropriate libraries were constructed.  Back in the 90s I wrote Java Applets and even taught a course on them.  But Java has been removed from all browsers "Because of the removal of older NPAPI plugins on which Java is built on."  But that was only one implementation of the Java VM.

You can write a script to go to another URL based upon information in the row: trow.addEventListener('click', eventhandler);  Remember to set role="link" and to use styles to notify users that it is a link.  See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/link_role for caveats.

Hey annevk! :) I want to do this one: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3296

Christine Belzie: sounds good, https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3296#issuecomment-353047461 still seems relevant there

> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Alexander Kalenik: Did you have a chance to look at https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9148#issuecomment-1610989949 ? I would love to get your implementer experience-informed opinion, before I go making changes.

uh, sorry it takes so long for me to respond. I have returned to working on navigables implementation for LibWeb and seems like I found another bug https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9686.

[04:55:05.0062] <Alexander Kalenik>
I will let you know once I've tried to actually implement your suggestion to solve destroy/abort bug.

[06:44:50.0215] <vhilla>
annevk: there hasn't been any progress on https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9469, can you please take a look?

[07:21:09.0511] <annevk>
vhilla: thanks for the ping, I'll relay it internally

[07:22:21.0193] <annevk>
vhilla: I guess it's not just up to WebKit though, if Chromium and Gecko want to have this specific divide there's nothing really stopping you from working on specifying it, unless Yusuke comes up with a strong reason not to, but I kinda doubt it

So since Ian Hickson worked on HTML, is it correct we added only these new elements:

1. Custom elements
2. slot
3. search

?

but element wise, yes.. tho I guess we completed dialog and had important additions to details and some other good stuff too

Great! Can you assign the issue to me? It'll let other contributors know that it's been solved.
