i'm looking at the wpt test data for URLs, and i'm a little confused by https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/url/resources/urltestdata.json#L4725

\uD800 \uD801 isn't a valid surrogate pair, so what exactly is meant by this particular input?

[18:49:28.0165] <zero-one>
my json parser chokes on it, understandably

[23:41:23.0977] <Domenic>
What is meant is to test what the URL parser does on invalid surrogate pairs

[23:41:48.0691] <Domenic>
The algorithm handles them just fine (since it operates on strings, which are sequences of 16-bit code units, including invalid surrogates)

I'm sure the URL parser handles it fine, but I think this is invalid JSON

[00:25:32.0474] <zero-one>
will need to dig up a parser that I can tell to ignore invalid surrogate pairs

JSON.parse() works fine on it

[07:34:08.0851] <Richard Gibson>
`"\uD800\uD801"` is valid JSON but not guaranteed to be interoperable (especially if the decoder is in a language that internally uses UTF-8 for strings), cf. https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259#section-8.2
> However, the ABNF in this specification allows member names and string values to contain bit sequences that cannot encode Unicode characters; for example, "\uDEAD" (a single unpaired UTF-16 surrogate)â€¦ The behavior of software that receives JSON texts containing such values is unpredictable; for example, implementations might return different values for the length of a string value or even suffer fatal runtime exceptions.

KBar, Ms2ger , Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders] , jgraham , emilio : I'm not aware of about:blank quirkiness constraints beyond: a) It's that way, because it has always been (and its logical given the lack of doctype) and b) the cases where the difference would be detectable are motivations both for and against changing it (folks who want the standards mode have a reason to change but existing content that puts stuff there could be adversely affected by a change).

Let's say Origin A contains an iframe to Origin B. Is it possible for Origin A to create another Origin B iframe without requiring another main fetch to Origin B? I was hoping I could use a blob url passed back from the Origin B iframe, but that doesn't seem to work https://static-misc-2.glitch.me/iframe-host/
