TIL github has a "close as duplicate" feature

annevk: do you think you'll be able to get to the select PRs soon?

Heads up WHATNOT attendees, as mentioned at https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11170, I will cancel today's meeting. I am wondering what to do about next week's meeting, as most if not all regular Chromium attendees won't be attending, including facilitators like myself. Can I get any signals of who is planning to attend next Thursday's meeting (9am PDT) or if people would rather skip next week as well?

[13:54:50.0848] <smaug>
I would attend, but I guess not a good time to discuss about XSLT there either ðŸ™‚ 

[16:22:09.0279] <Panos Astithas>
Yeah, we should probably do that in a future meeting.

Dominic Farolino: I suspect next week, yes

[22:57:51.0382] <annevk>
Panos Astithas: seems okay to cancel to me

[23:15:32.0165] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: also, maybe you could elaborate a bit on your plan as not all the PRs seem ready. How are we not going to end up with an inconsistent state?

[07:43:08.0201] <jarhar>
some of the PRs define the same concept about how to find the association between option and select elements i think, but i can easily resolve those merge conflicts

[07:43:32.0241] <jarhar>
i split up the PRs as best i could to make them independent to make them easier to review

[07:43:44.0017] <jarhar>
i am confident there wont be an inconsistent state

[07:44:05.0155] <jarhar>
would it help for me to merge them all together into a separate mega PR?

[08:32:48.0812] <annevk>
I think it's fine to keep them separate, though if they have conflicts that will present some issues.

[09:13:56.0766] <annevk>
bakkot: it's happening: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11143 (first real Float16Array dep I'm aware of and the OG use case)

[09:15:19.0565] <bakkot>
ðŸŽ‰ glad that work ended up being useful

[09:15:45.0635] <bakkot>
of course it was mostly other people who did the actual work but I'd have felt bad if I prompted them to do implementations and then it wasn't actually used

In the HTML spec, what determines whether a `<dl>` is `class="switch"`?
