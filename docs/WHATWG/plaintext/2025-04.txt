TIL github has a "close as duplicate" feature

annevk: do you think you'll be able to get to the select PRs soon?

Heads up WHATNOT attendees, as mentioned at https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11170, I will cancel today's meeting. I am wondering what to do about next week's meeting, as most if not all regular Chromium attendees won't be attending, including facilitators like myself. Can I get any signals of who is planning to attend next Thursday's meeting (9am PDT) or if people would rather skip next week as well?

[13:54:50.0848] <smaug>
I would attend, but I guess not a good time to discuss about XSLT there either üôÇ 

[16:22:09.0279] <Panos Astithas>
Yeah, we should probably do that in a future meeting.

[22:57:07.0099] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: I suspect next week, yes

[22:57:51.0382] <annevk>
Panos Astithas: seems okay to cancel to me

[23:15:32.0165] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: also, maybe you could elaborate a bit on your plan as not all the PRs seem ready. How are we not going to end up with an inconsistent state?

[07:43:08.0201] <jarhar>
some of the PRs define the same concept about how to find the association between option and select elements i think, but i can easily resolve those merge conflicts

[07:43:32.0241] <jarhar>
i split up the PRs as best i could to make them independent to make them easier to review

[07:43:44.0017] <jarhar>
i am confident there wont be an inconsistent state

[07:44:05.0155] <jarhar>
would it help for me to merge them all together into a separate mega PR?

[08:32:48.0812] <annevk>
I think it's fine to keep them separate, though if they have conflicts that will present some issues.

[09:13:56.0766] <annevk>
bakkot: it's happening: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11143 (first real Float16Array dep I'm aware of and the OG use case)

[09:15:19.0565] <bakkot>
üéâ glad that work ended up being useful

[09:15:45.0635] <bakkot>
of course it was mostly other people who did the actual work but I'd have felt bad if I prompted them to do implementations and then it wasn't actually used

In the HTML spec, what determines whether a `<dl>` is `class="switch"`?

[06:32:42.0291] <jmdyck>
E.g., if you search (case-insensitively) for "run the appropriate set", you get 5 hits, each followed by a `<dl>`, of which 3 are switches, and 2 aren't.

[13:15:34.0701] <Noam Rosenthal>
Expanding the search finds ~8 "run the appropriate steps|substeps|set of steps|etc.|" that are `switch` and ~2 that aren't


2025-04-06
[14:51:21.0091] <jmdyck>
There are certainly more examples, I just picked that search as an easy way to show some contrasting cases.

Hi! I want to know if there's any likelihood of footnotes becoming an element of HTML. They're mentioned in the HTML spec in section 4.14.4 as a feature without "a dedicated mechanism." The spec then suggests alternatives. Of the alternatives: using <title> is inaccessible, using <a> causes me to easily lose my place in the text with how I prefer to have it positioned on the screen, and the other suggestions don't apply to the type of footnotes I'm interested in. Altogether, I feel pretty dissatisfied with the state of footnotes on the web. :(

I genuinely love reading footnotes in fiction (for jokes and translation notes!) but the UX for footnotes on the web makes it so that the inconvenience of them outweighs the joy I'd get from reading those extra bits when they'd be most appropriate. I was happy enough to overlook the inconvenience but after so many encounters I feel like there has to be a better way.

I‚Äôm not part of WHATWG, but this is a topic I am interested in.
However, note that there are many ways to do footnotes:

1. As is most popular on the web, you can put footnote content at the very end of a page or section and link references to them in the main text.
2. Using CSS Grid, you can make footnote content appear in a sidebar, Edward Tufte style (https://www.edwardtufte.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VE-Spread-Detail-2.jpg). This is my personal preferred way to do footnotes.
3. Using HTML Popovers, you can put footnote content declaratively in a popover element, then add references to them in the main text using buttons. The buttons can declaratively make their respective popovers appear.

For all three methods, an `<aside>` element could contain the footnote content. But all of these are quite different semantically.

That‚Äôs the problem with trying to standardize ‚Äúfootnotes‚Äù. The semantics of what we call ‚Äúfootnotes‚Äù are diverse and may be quite specific to the document context that they appear in. Some people will want content at the very end; some people will want them in a sidebar near their references; some people will want popovers.

(With that said, I‚Äôm a bit surprised nobody else has asked this question in the whatwg/html GitHub repository. But I know that this has been discussed many times in the past.)

[21:53:48.0639] <Smudge>
Yeah! Language is funky and weird. I'm using "footnotes" to mean notes that appear in a page's footer, which is more relevant for print than web. I think print might have more specific words for these that haven't reached web people. ü§î Something in my brain is telling me that "endnotes" is for the ones that appear at the very end of a work. I haven't played with HTML Popovers yet. I'll look into that some more! Thanks for the tip, jschoi!

[22:05:00.0541] <jschoi>
Smudge: If you‚Äôre most interested in layout out footnotes in printed pages, you‚Äôre looking for the [CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/).

You might also be interested in the generated cross-references in the (confusingly similarly named) [CSS Generated Content Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-content-3/).

Those are good to know about! I'd like to make my footnotes work in both print and web if possible. Thank you, again!

[22:29:34.0744] <annevk>
There's a section on footnotes: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#footnotes

> <@annevk:matrix.org> There's a section on footnotes: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#footnotes

Yes, I mentioned as much before, but the suggested alternatives to implement the type of footnotes I'm looking for each have undesirable limitations‚Äîof them, only the first two are relevant and of those, the first is inaccessible and the second I find disorienting. üòî

[02:20:18.0696] <Andreu Botella>
There aren't any ways to detect whether a cross-origin iframe or parent is in the same agent, right?

[02:21:15.0998] <Andreu Botella>
I'm assuming we don't want a new API to make that information potentially exposable, right?

[02:44:46.0158] <annevk>
keithamus: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10802 has gotten a bit messy since the "good first issue" label was added. Are you willing to untangle it and give the people that showed up some more feedback?

[02:45:24.0831] <annevk>
And maybe we should consider this the final nail in the coffin for that label. Unfortunate, but it doesn't seem to work well.

[02:45:36.0216] <annevk>
* And maybe we should consider this the final nail in the coffin for that label. Unfortunate, but it doesn't seem to work well. Or maybe too well?

[02:46:05.0770] <annevk>
Andreu Botella: that's right.

[02:47:33.0816] <annevk>
Andreu Botella: although, what we really don't want to expose are the actual process boundaries. Maybe exposing agents can be okay, but we're in the midst of changing the agent boundary through the `document.domain` removal so hmm.

[02:48:23.0179] <Andreu Botella>
implementation-wise, would that map to e.g. having different V8 isolates, even if it's in the same process?

[02:51:59.0969] <annevk>
I'm not sure. Browsers don't really have a good handle on agents which is another reason to avoid exposing them I suppose.

[02:56:42.0277] <Andreu Botella>
For AsyncContext, I don't think cross-origin events would be too much of an issue, but Scott Haseley pointed out that at least in Chrome, the `focus` and `blur` events can be fired synchronously across agents (related to https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3506), so that might have to be special cased

[02:57:59.0350] <Andreu Botella>
since for events fired sycnhronously, AsyncContext would always propagate the context, which would be able to be used to detect whether the iframes are in the same agent, or even in the same process

[02:58:09.0125] <Andreu Botella>

[04:22:52.0317] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: just to confirm, appending Math.random() to an image URL's query is sufficient to cache bust it right?

[04:24:07.0139] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: yea unless someone is fiddling with the random seed

[04:38:30.0152] <Noam Rosenthal>
(I've used `performance.now()` for this a few times and that caused flakes on some platforms)

[04:38:59.0721] <Noam Rosenthal>
If I'm doing this in a test I usually prefer to have an incrementing index

[04:58:43.0294] <Luca Casonato>
Is there currently a way to have an element be persistently at the top of the top layer? Imagine a side-drawer that is implemented as a `<dialog>`, but then you also want a global toast that can show ontop of the dialog backdrop (and dialog). Because top layer ordering is controlled by opening order, this means that one would have to make the toast a `popover` and then close and re-open it everytime something else gets added to the top-layer, so that the toast is always at the top of the top layer. Is there a better way?

[04:59:34.0015] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: should be fine here, they're all reftests

[05:00:18.0946] <annevk>
Luca Casonato: I don't think so. Might be worth filing an issue on.

[05:00:46.0673] <Luca Casonato>
@anne

[05:01:03.0936] <Luca Casonato>
@annevk Will do. The more I get exposed to the top layer, the more I feel like it is not a good abstraction :(

[05:05:59.0491] <Luca Casonato>
> <@lucacasonato:matrix.org> @annevk Will do. The more I get exposed to the top layer, the more I feel like it is not a good abstraction :(

https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11193

[05:09:31.0546] <annevk>
Luca Casonato: yeah maybe. What's at least clear is that developers would like more control over it. Though how to give that and not run into other issues doesn't seem straightforward to solve.
