TIL github has a "close as duplicate" feature

annevk: do you think you'll be able to get to the select PRs soon?

Heads up WHATNOT attendees, as mentioned at https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11170, I will cancel today's meeting. I am wondering what to do about next week's meeting, as most if not all regular Chromium attendees won't be attending, including facilitators like myself. Can I get any signals of who is planning to attend next Thursday's meeting (9am PDT) or if people would rather skip next week as well?

I would attend, but I guess not a good time to discuss about XSLT there either ðŸ™‚ 

[16:22:09.0279] <Panos Astithas>
Yeah, we should probably do that in a future meeting.

Dominic Farolino: I suspect next week, yes

[22:57:51.0382] <annevk>
Panos Astithas: seems okay to cancel to me

[23:15:32.0165] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: also, maybe you could elaborate a bit on your plan as not all the PRs seem ready. How are we not going to end up with an inconsistent state?
