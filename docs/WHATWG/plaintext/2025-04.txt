annevk: do you think you'll be able to get to the select PRs soon?

[09:49:57.0620] <Panos Astithas>
Heads up WHATNOT attendees, as mentioned at https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11170, I will cancel today's meeting. I am wondering what to do about next week's meeting, as most if not all regular Chromium attendees won't be attending, including facilitators like myself. Can I get any signals of who is planning to attend next Thursday's meeting (9am PDT) or if people would rather skip next week as well?

[13:54:50.0848] <smaug>
I would attend, but I guess not a good time to discuss about XSLT there either üôÇ 

[16:22:09.0279] <Panos Astithas>
Yeah, we should probably do that in a future meeting.


2025-04-04
[22:57:07.0099] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: I suspect next week, yes

[22:57:51.0382] <annevk>
Panos Astithas: seems okay to cancel to me

[23:15:32.0165] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: also, maybe you could elaborate a bit on your plan as not all the PRs seem ready. How are we not going to end up with an inconsistent state?

[07:43:08.0201] <jarhar>
some of the PRs define the same concept about how to find the association between option and select elements i think, but i can easily resolve those merge conflicts

[07:43:32.0241] <jarhar>
i split up the PRs as best i could to make them independent to make them easier to review

[07:43:44.0017] <jarhar>
i am confident there wont be an inconsistent state

[07:44:05.0155] <jarhar>
would it help for me to merge them all together into a separate mega PR?

[08:32:48.0812] <annevk>
I think it's fine to keep them separate, though if they have conflicts that will present some issues.

[09:13:56.0766] <annevk>
bakkot: it's happening: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11143 (first real Float16Array dep I'm aware of and the OG use case)

[09:15:19.0565] <bakkot>
üéâ glad that work ended up being useful

[09:15:45.0635] <bakkot>
of course it was mostly other people who did the actual work but I'd have felt bad if I prompted them to do implementations and then it wasn't actually used

In the HTML spec, what determines whether a `<dl>` is `class="switch"`?

[06:32:42.0291] <jmdyck>
E.g., if you search (case-insensitively) for "run the appropriate set", you get 5 hits, each followed by a `<dl>`, of which 3 are switches, and 2 aren't.

[13:15:34.0701] <Noam Rosenthal>
Expanding the search finds ~8 "run the appropriate steps|substeps|set of steps|etc.|" that are `switch` and ~2 that aren't


2025-04-06
[14:51:21.0091] <jmdyck>
There are certainly more examples, I just picked that search as an easy way to show some contrasting cases.

Hi! I want to know if there's any likelihood of footnotes becoming an element of HTML. They're mentioned in the HTML spec in section 4.14.4 as a feature without "a dedicated mechanism." The spec then suggests alternatives. Of the alternatives: using <title> is inaccessible, using <a> causes me to easily lose my place in the text with how I prefer to have it positioned on the screen, and the other suggestions don't apply to the type of footnotes I'm interested in. Altogether, I feel pretty dissatisfied with the state of footnotes on the web. :(

I genuinely love reading footnotes in fiction (for jokes and translation notes!) but the UX for footnotes on the web makes it so that the inconvenience of them outweighs the joy I'd get from reading those extra bits when they'd be most appropriate. I was happy enough to overlook the inconvenience but after so many encounters I feel like there has to be a better way.

[21:37:35.0737] <jschoi>
I‚Äôm not part of WHATWG, but this is a topic I am interested in.
However, note that there are many ways to do footnotes:

1. As is most popular on the web, you can put footnote content at the very end of a page or section and link references to them in the main text.
2. Using CSS Grid, you can make footnote content appear in a sidebar, Edward Tufte style (https://www.edwardtufte.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VE-Spread-Detail-2.jpg). This is my personal preferred way to do footnotes.
3. Using HTML Popovers, you can put footnote content declaratively in a popover element, then add references to them in the main text using buttons. The buttons can declaratively make their respective popovers appear.

For all three methods, an `<aside>` element could contain the footnote content. But all of these are quite different semantically.

That‚Äôs the problem with trying to standardize ‚Äúfootnotes‚Äù. The semantics of what we call ‚Äúfootnotes‚Äù are diverse and may be quite specific to the document context that they appear in. Some people will want content at the very end; some people will want them in a sidebar near their references; some people will want popovers.

(With that said, I‚Äôm a bit surprised nobody else has asked this question in the whatwg/html GitHub repository. But I know that this has been discussed many times in the past.)

[21:53:48.0639] <Smudge>
Yeah! Language is funky and weird. I'm using "footnotes" to mean notes that appear in a page's footer, which is more relevant for print than web. I think print might have more specific words for these that haven't reached web people. ü§î Something in my brain is telling me that "endnotes" is for the ones that appear at the very end of a work. I haven't played with HTML Popovers yet. I'll look into that some more! Thanks for the tip, jschoi!

[22:05:00.0541] <jschoi>
Smudge: If you‚Äôre most interested in layout out footnotes in printed pages, you‚Äôre looking for the [CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/).

You might also be interested in the generated cross-references in the (confusingly similarly named) [CSS Generated Content Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-content-3/).

Yes, I mentioned as much before, but the suggested alternatives to implement the type of footnotes I'm looking for each have undesirable limitations‚Äîof them, only the first two are relevant and of those, the first is inaccessible and the second I find disorienting. üòî

There aren't any ways to detect whether a cross-origin iframe or parent is in the same agent, right?

[02:21:15.0998] <Andreu Botella>
I'm assuming we don't want a new API to make that information potentially exposable, right?

[02:44:46.0158] <annevk>
keithamus: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10802 has gotten a bit messy since the "good first issue" label was added. Are you willing to untangle it and give the people that showed up some more feedback?

[02:45:24.0831] <annevk>
And maybe we should consider this the final nail in the coffin for that label. Unfortunate, but it doesn't seem to work well.

[02:45:36.0216] <annevk>
* And maybe we should consider this the final nail in the coffin for that label. Unfortunate, but it doesn't seem to work well. Or maybe too well?

[02:46:05.0770] <annevk>
Andreu Botella: that's right.

[02:47:33.0816] <annevk>
Andreu Botella: although, what we really don't want to expose are the actual process boundaries. Maybe exposing agents can be okay, but we're in the midst of changing the agent boundary through the `document.domain` removal so hmm.

[02:48:23.0179] <Andreu Botella>
implementation-wise, would that map to e.g. having different V8 isolates, even if it's in the same process?

[02:51:59.0969] <annevk>
I'm not sure. Browsers don't really have a good handle on agents which is another reason to avoid exposing them I suppose.

[02:56:42.0277] <Andreu Botella>
For AsyncContext, I don't think cross-origin events would be too much of an issue, but Scott Haseley pointed out that at least in Chrome, the `focus` and `blur` events can be fired synchronously across agents (related to https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3506), so that might have to be special cased

[02:57:59.0350] <Andreu Botella>
since for events fired sycnhronously, AsyncContext would always propagate the context, which would be able to be used to detect whether the iframes are in the same agent, or even in the same process

[04:58:43.0294] <Luca Casonato>
Is there currently a way to have an element be persistently at the top of the top layer? Imagine a side-drawer that is implemented as a `<dialog>`, but then you also want a global toast that can show ontop of the dialog backdrop (and dialog). Because top layer ordering is controlled by opening order, this means that one would have to make the toast a `popover` and then close and re-open it everytime something else gets added to the top-layer, so that the toast is always at the top of the top layer. Is there a better way?

[04:59:34.0015] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: should be fine here, they're all reftests

[05:00:18.0946] <annevk>
Luca Casonato: I don't think so. Might be worth filing an issue on.

[05:01:03.0936] <Luca Casonato>

[06:21:46.0620] <Luke Warlow>
I suspect we'd maybe be better trying to directly solve the specific use cases rather than ripping open the layer for all to access. Like perhaps we need a toast primitive that is always on top.

That‚Äôs an option too for sure.

How does hit detection work for the top layer (where is it specified)? In my tests the first layer of the top layer always sits ontop of any newer layers (which do render on top of the first layer). Both Chrome and Firefox behave this way seemingly.

Oh it seems like this happens because when the dialog is opened through `showModal()`, it makes the rest of the page `inert`, including the other things in the top layer above it.

[08:50:32.0441] <Luca Casonato>
I think https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#blocked-by-a-modal-dialog should get an exception for elements in the top layer above the subject dialog. I'll open an issue.

There's actually been some discussion about this recently related to the interactivity property. Essentially you need to do more than just "uninert" the top layer items. AT won't let you navigate to the higher items otherwise

The GitHub hover popovers actually make text selection impossible. Try to select the username of the last commit shown on https://github.com/whatwg/fetch. It's not possible and breaks down differently in each browser.

[01:42:24.0285] <Luca Casonato>
Works for me in Chrome on Linux.

[01:43:56.0724] <annevk>
It's not jank if you do it slowly and the dialog pops up while you're doing it?

[01:44:23.0647] <annevk>
It's definitely jank here. There's ways to workaround it, but it's not a great experience.

Yeah that sucks, we should open an issue on them

[06:57:30.0818] <annevk>
I wasn't entirely sure as it seems they do in fact define a language that defines similar elements but they are not the same elements? And so I wasn't sure what to recommend them. But maybe we should file an issue anyway?

[07:24:47.0854] <annevk>
Interesting, neither Chromium nor WebKit seem to really implement the keep the global around for initial about:blank? Or maybe there are more ways to reset "is initial about:blank" than the specification suggests?

[07:32:32.0718] <annevk>
https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/51895 has my test. This result makes some sense to me as at least in WebKit the script environment is heavily intertwined with the navigable document. But maybe it's more subtle somehow?

[08:12:18.0039] <annevk>
TabAtkins: so it's https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-34/#sec-smil-body-elem which is a separate `body` element

[08:12:35.0835] <TabAtkins>
Oh, hmmm

[08:12:45.0505] <annevk>
TabAtkins: so maybe we need some additional namespacing to distinguish the various elements?

I don't think it's an "end" state. The parser PR is ready and approved by Simon, and the last open thread is done from our perspective. I haven't finished reviewing https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10629 but I think having it fast-follow seems fine to me. We'd love any reviews you might have time to submit though.

[09:46:16.0877] <annevk>
I left a number of comments. There also appear to be inconsistencies between the PRs. I do think all PRs should land within a couple of hours from each other.

[10:45:15.0800] <Luke Warlow>
I don't think the parser change itself need be reliant on the rest right? It would seem okay for a browser to ship the parser change today and ship the rest of appearance base-select in future?

It's also one where having tests merged etc would be useful to the wider ecosystem. I've had to patch at least one npm package to include the new behaviour for it to work correctly. I imagine frameworks would benefit from it too?

[18:17:53.0587] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: annevk : this seems like a case for link-defaults, just on a larger scale? Like maybe all WHATWG specs get link-defaults for all HTML elements? Or maybe "all web specs", if we can operationalize that? Or even all Bikeshed specs, so that epub-related specs are the ones that need to override the link defaults? (But I'm not sure how such epub-related specs would necessarily find that out...)

[18:43:10.0165] <TabAtkins>
Yeah, I'm gonna have to figure something out. The big global namespace works *adequately* for W3C specs, but as more come online these sort of conflicts will happen more often.

FYI, I'm on vacation until nearly the end of the month.

E.g. same-origin.html in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/804797 doesn't use load events at all and I think it's testing window object reuse.

Ah yeah it does. And if you set `.src` after connection it does take effect. I do see replacement then. https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/13652

Domenic: that test is pretty clear, but it seems the PR got abandoned? I tried to find it on wpt.fyi but it's not there.

[23:29:37.0328] <Domenic>
Yes, I think Daniel was unsure what the spec expected exactly, and we didn't give him clear enough answers fast enough...

[23:33:44.0441] <annevk>
Ah, that's too bad. Is it easy for you to create a WPT PR out of those tests?

[00:56:00.0868] <Domenic>
Eh, I'd have to verify they match the spec, which could take some time... if there's traction on solving this problem I might make the time

[01:06:12.0774] <annevk>
Domenic: just a draft PR would be nice so we can see the results.

[01:07:08.0466] <annevk>
I'm not really committed to solving it just yet, but I'm interested in learning more.

Noam Rosenthal: the Deferred fetching PR logs a CI error

[01:47:38.0637] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: there's also very many unresolved comment threads (though it seems like you did address them, just not hit resolve)

[02:05:54.0961] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: in https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10903 I think you forgot to push

[02:06:47.0755] <annevk>
Generally it's a good idea to push before resolving as otherwise you have entered a race with the reviewer. (Which you lost this time around. üòõ)

[04:23:45.0225] <Noam Rosenthal>
Hehe I actually pushed to my private repo and forgot that I used a branch in the whatwg repo for this one... but yea noted

[05:20:26.0474] <Noam Rosenthal>
All closed and no CI errors.

[05:25:26.0137] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: thanks, do you remember who we clash with on "allowed to use"? I wonder if that's an upstream bug.
