TIL github has a "close as duplicate" feature

annevk: do you think you'll be able to get to the select PRs soon?

Heads up WHATNOT attendees, as mentioned at https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11170, I will cancel today's meeting. I am wondering what to do about next week's meeting, as most if not all regular Chromium attendees won't be attending, including facilitators like myself. Can I get any signals of who is planning to attend next Thursday's meeting (9am PDT) or if people would rather skip next week as well?

[13:54:50.0848] <smaug>
I would attend, but I guess not a good time to discuss about XSLT there either üôÇ 

[16:22:09.0279] <Panos Astithas>
Yeah, we should probably do that in a future meeting.

Dominic Farolino: I suspect next week, yes

[22:57:51.0382] <annevk>
Panos Astithas: seems okay to cancel to me

[23:15:32.0165] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: also, maybe you could elaborate a bit on your plan as not all the PRs seem ready. How are we not going to end up with an inconsistent state?

[07:43:08.0201] <jarhar>
some of the PRs define the same concept about how to find the association between option and select elements i think, but i can easily resolve those merge conflicts

[07:43:32.0241] <jarhar>
i split up the PRs as best i could to make them independent to make them easier to review

[07:43:44.0017] <jarhar>
i am confident there wont be an inconsistent state

[07:44:05.0155] <jarhar>
would it help for me to merge them all together into a separate mega PR?

[08:32:48.0812] <annevk>
I think it's fine to keep them separate, though if they have conflicts that will present some issues.

[09:13:56.0766] <annevk>
bakkot: it's happening: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11143 (first real Float16Array dep I'm aware of and the OG use case)

[09:15:19.0565] <bakkot>
üéâ glad that work ended up being useful

[09:15:45.0635] <bakkot>
of course it was mostly other people who did the actual work but I'd have felt bad if I prompted them to do implementations and then it wasn't actually used

In the HTML spec, what determines whether a `<dl>` is `class="switch"`?

[06:32:42.0291] <jmdyck>
E.g., if you search (case-insensitively) for "run the appropriate set", you get 5 hits, each followed by a `<dl>`, of which 3 are switches, and 2 aren't.

[13:15:34.0701] <Noam Rosenthal>
Expanding the search finds ~8 "run the appropriate steps|substeps|set of steps|etc.|" that are `switch` and ~2 that aren't


2025-04-06
[14:51:21.0091] <jmdyck>
There are certainly more examples, I just picked that search as an easy way to show some contrasting cases.

Hi! I want to know if there's any likelihood of footnotes becoming an element of HTML. They're mentioned in the HTML spec in section 4.14.4 as a feature without "a dedicated mechanism." The spec then suggests alternatives. Of the alternatives: using <title> is inaccessible, using <a> causes me to easily lose my place in the text with how I prefer to have it positioned on the screen, and the other suggestions don't apply to the type of footnotes I'm interested in. Altogether, I feel pretty dissatisfied with the state of footnotes on the web. :(

I genuinely love reading footnotes in fiction (for jokes and translation notes!) but the UX for footnotes on the web makes it so that the inconvenience of them outweighs the joy I'd get from reading those extra bits when they'd be most appropriate. I was happy enough to overlook the inconvenience but after so many encounters I feel like there has to be a better way.

I‚Äôm not part of WHATWG, but this is a topic I am interested in.
However, note that there are many ways to do footnotes:

1. As is most popular on the web, you can put footnote content at the very end of a page or section and link references to them in the main text.
2. Using CSS Grid, you can make footnote content appear in a sidebar, Edward Tufte style (https://www.edwardtufte.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VE-Spread-Detail-2.jpg). This is my personal preferred way to do footnotes.
3. Using HTML Popovers, you can put footnote content declaratively in a popover element, then add references to them in the main text using buttons. The buttons can declaratively make their respective popovers appear.

For all three methods, an `<aside>` element could contain the footnote content. But all of these are quite different semantically.

That‚Äôs the problem with trying to standardize ‚Äúfootnotes‚Äù. The semantics of what we call ‚Äúfootnotes‚Äù are diverse and may be quite specific to the document context that they appear in. Some people will want content at the very end; some people will want them in a sidebar near their references; some people will want popovers.

(With that said, I‚Äôm a bit surprised nobody else has asked this question in the whatwg/html GitHub repository. But I know that this has been discussed many times in the past.)

[21:53:48.0639] <Smudge>
Yeah! Language is funky and weird. I'm using "footnotes" to mean notes that appear in a page's footer, which is more relevant for print than web. I think print might have more specific words for these that haven't reached web people. ü§î Something in my brain is telling me that "endnotes" is for the ones that appear at the very end of a work. I haven't played with HTML Popovers yet. I'll look into that some more! Thanks for the tip, jschoi!

Smudge: If you‚Äôre most interested in layout out footnotes in printed pages, you‚Äôre looking for the [CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/).

You might also be interested in the generated cross-references in the (confusingly similarly named) [CSS Generated Content Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-content-3/).

Those are good to know about! I'd like to make my footnotes work in both print and web if possible. Thank you, again!

There's a section on footnotes: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics-other.html#footnotes

Yes, I mentioned as much before, but the suggested alternatives to implement the type of footnotes I'm looking for each have undesirable limitations‚Äîof them, only the first two are relevant and of those, the first is inaccessible and the second I find disorienting. üòî
