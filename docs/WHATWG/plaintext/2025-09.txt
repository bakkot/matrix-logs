I assume there isn't any way to get single-page diffs for PRs?

If you add `.diff` at the end of the URL like https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/11543.diff you get the plain text diff, if that helps

Reviewing especially larger PRs is a bit tricky when they are split to so many diffs

[05:40:41.0665] <smaug>
I was thinking the spec preview diffs

[05:40:55.0629] <Ms2ger>
Ah, that I don't know

Especially because cross linking seems mildly broken on the preview URLs

(looking at ReferenceTarget atm, 16 diffs)

I always just build locally. (But that doesn't give a HTML diff, just, the new HTML.)

If someone was able to update PR preview to use https://github.com/whatwg/build.whatwg.org?tab=readme-ov-file#html-build , we could get singlepage builds and diffs (and also fix other things missed by the PR preview, like syntax highlighting or preprocessing). But I'm unsure how to maintain PR preview.
