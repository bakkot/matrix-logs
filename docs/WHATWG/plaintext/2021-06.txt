I made a bot for rendering better (i.e., linkable) logs for matrix channels, for tc39's use. if ya'll would like I can have it do this channel too. currently logs are at https://bakkot.github.io/matrix-logs/, or you can run it yourself from https://github.com/bakkot/matrix-archive-bot

[18:26:35.0141] <bakkot>
logs are going to be a bit behind because I'm not bothering to have it monitor continuously

For anybody here interested in helping improve content at MDN, https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/5523 is maybe a good first issue that would probably take only 30 minutes or so of work

[21:56:36.0433] <sideshowbarker>
The work would be writing some additional text that elaborates on the following statement:
> Setting the value of `location.href` _navigates_ to the provided URL. If you want _redirection_, use `location.replace()`

[00:46:37.0691] <zcorpan_>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> zcorpan_: there was already a zcorpan without underscore? :-)

 Yes. I signed up in 2019. Since then the account has been deactivated, not sure why. Don't know if it's possible to reactivate it :-(

[00:48:47.0417] <annevk>
zcorpan_: ah, sucks. You could probably find another server as well if you want and get an account there, but not sure how much effort you want to put into it.

[00:51:28.0674] <zcorpan_>
annevk: I'll wait until someone tells me it's possible to reclaim the old name :)

[00:53:50.0281] <MayeulC>
Well, you can still change your display name to one without the underscore.

I wish Matrix had "done" / "ack" / "this" / etc. reactions besides emoji.

https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/2648

[04:48:13.0719] <sideshowbarker>
Per that discussion, you can do it already in some Matrix clients

[04:48:38.0115] <sideshowbarker>
...just not in Element

[05:28:47.0221] <MayeulC>
I reacted with a few frequently-used examples:

* ‚ûï for +1
* ‚úÖ for done
* üßæ for ack
* ‚òùÔ∏èor üëÜÔ∏è for this

You can send custom events via devtools in element, but it's a hassle. At the end of the day, it's a matter of convention. I quite liked some CI bot that indicated runner status with üü¢ üî¥ üü†.

[05:29:29.0711] <ryzokuken>
Fluffychat has pretty solid support for custom emotes already.

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> lpd: per spec I think Chrome is wrong and I don't think there's an issue on changing this

Hi, a new day and a fresh set of eyes, I noticed what I was looking for yesterday staring me right in the face: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus-fixup-rule. Would you agree the correct behaviour is actually the other way around to what we discussed yesterday?

[08:55:45.0277] <lpd>
The language "removed from that Document in some way" seems pretty weird to me, but the examples are clear.

[08:55:53.0001] <lpd>
 * The language "removed from that Document in some way" seems pretty weird to me, but the examples are clear in my novice reading.

[08:56:21.0616] <annevk>
lpd: none of the examples are about rendering though, but that is indeed extremely ambiguous; it likely wouldn't pass review if written today

[08:58:33.0853] <lpd>
annevk: In the main text, I believe it's covered by "it stops being a focusable area", since for an input element to be a focusable area it must meet "the element is either being rendered or being used as relevant canvas fallback content."

[08:58:53.0570] <annevk>
I guess focusable area is defined in terms of being rendered, yeah

[08:59:56.0212] <lpd>
The example box specifically mentions the `hidden` attribute, but I'm not sure if those are normative?

[09:00:01.0561] <annevk>
However, it doesn't seem to invoke an algorithm to change the focused area, meaning no events would dispatch and such and it's a bit unclear what state would change

[09:00:30.0237] <annevk>
Examples are non-normative, but they're also not supposed to be wrong :-)

[09:00:49.0255] <annevk>
lpd: I guess at this point I'd lean towards an issue against whatwg/html though

[09:01:06.0033] <annevk>
/me wonders if there is one already

[09:03:22.0313] <annevk>
(I only found other issues)

[09:04:18.0931] <lpd>
> designate the Document's viewport to be the new focused area of the document
annevk I believe the confusion comes from this, right? Whether this requires the **focusing steps** are run?

I wonder if others are getting 500 errors and other weirdness from GitHub right now

[01:28:27.0188] <foolip>
It's not entirely like normal for me. Pushing a new branch didn't give the URL to create a PR from it, so something internally isn't working.

[01:28:58.0302] <sideshowbarker>
oh foolip good timing 

[01:29:13.0016] <foolip>
I'm trying to make a PR for you actually :)

[01:29:14.0483] <sideshowbarker>
I am actually trying to review https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10717

[01:29:37.0119] <foolip>
Ah, trying to approve gives you a 500?

[01:30:04.0851] <sideshowbarker>
worse ‚Äî can‚Äôt even navigate to https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10717/files

[01:30:32.0540] <sideshowbarker>
oh wow that‚Äôs a bonus of moving away from IRC, right there

[01:30:50.0114] <foolip>
Inline preview of URLs? Yeah that's great.

[01:30:58.0779] <foolip>
So trying to create a new PR gives me a 500.

[01:31:59.0779] <foolip>
And I guess I won't try to hammer it because maybe it actually has been created...

[01:32:15.0427] <sideshowbarker>

Ok, will take a look

[04:01:09.0205] <sideshowbarker>
annevk Other than   AbortSignal.abort() and shadowing.delegatesFocus, are there any features in the DOM spec that have less than 2 implementations?

[04:09:47.0912] <annevk>
Nobody else shipped AbortSignal.abort() yet?

[04:10:33.0871] <annevk>
In general though I'm not the best at keeping track of these things. If that's what wpt says I'd trust that. üòä

[04:18:39.0701] <sideshowbarker>
Ok

[08:57:50.0775] <miketayl_r>
sup everyone

[08:58:42.0521] <sideshowbarker>
howdy hey miketayl_r 

[08:59:09.0774] <miketayl_r>
(took me a minute to figure out how to add this room... i thought i would need to add a new server or something)

[08:59:11.0768] <miketayl_r>
web 4.0 is wild

[09:02:00.0065] <sideshowbarker>
miketayl_r: about that, we have a requirement here that you throw in as many emoji as possible into your messages and decorate other people‚Äôs messages with as many as possible

[09:02:12.0272] <miketayl_r>
i will do my best

[09:02:34.0481] <sideshowbarker>
OK cool ‚Äîbecause as you know, the answer to ‚ÄúWhat is web 4.0‚Äù is clearly: emoji

[09:02:50.0149] <miketayl_r>
i actually just learned that web 3.0 is crypto, https://blogs.opera.com/tips-and-tricks/2021/01/what-is-web-3-0-and-why-you-should-care/

[09:03:26.0168] <miketayl_r>
or maybe it's iot, i dunno

[09:04:04.0378] <sideshowbarker>
hmm, crypto + emoji = web 5.0?

[09:04:57.0393] <sideshowbarker>
you can also get more reputation points by posting giant superfluous images directly to the channel ‚Äî like at https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#whatwg:matrix.org/$CyvdZzCILRkt0d6OWU46KOgkZDua8XxPni328gm35j4

[09:05:31.0108] <miketayl_r>
the possibilities are endless

[09:06:35.0239] <sideshowbarker>
that‚Äôs the new addendum motto to your motto: *‚ÄúPlease leave your sense of logic at the door ‚Ä¶ the possibilities are endless‚Äù*

[09:06:54.0347] <sideshowbarker>
heh

[09:08:02.0516] <sideshowbarker>
and finally, note that wanderview arrived here one hour ahead of you, so he‚Äôs got that much extra reputation points already that he can spend

[09:08:21.0419] <sideshowbarker>
howdy wanderview too

[09:08:59.0816] <miketayl_r>
i assume the longer i idle, the more whatwg coin i mine

[09:10:17.0020] <miketayl_r>
ok, i have a real question, maybe for tabatkins -- it seems like the spec `make deploy` script gets sad if you have EXTRA_FILES -- it eventually calls `curlbikeshed` and then that errors out because it can't find those files (i guess it runs in `/tmp`)

[09:10:20.0439] <miketayl_r>
e.g., https://github.com/whatwg/compat/pull/147/checks?check_run_id=2690411902

[09:10:48.0505] <miketayl_r>
i wonder if anybody else has run into this yet

[09:11:11.0048] <miketayl_r>
https://compat.spec.whatwg.org/stroked-text.png is obviously v important

[09:13:18.0881] <hober>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> hmm, crypto + emoji = web 5.0?

wouldn't it be web 9.0? maybe i did the math wrong

[09:13:34.0639] <hober>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> hmm, crypto + emoji = web 5.0?

 * wouldn't it be web 7.0? maybe i did the math wrong

[09:13:48.0692] <hober>
> <@hober:mozilla.org> wouldn't it be web 7.0? maybe i did the math wrong

hahahah i really did do the math wrong

[09:15:09.0686] <miketayl_r>
lol

[09:15:12.0617] <jgraham>
Right, web 9.0 is when we have an API for executing JS in ring0 (behind a permission prompt)

[09:15:43.0909] <sideshowbarker>
miketayl_r: looking at https://resources.whatwg.org/build/deploy.sh now. I think annevk and Domenic would know something about `EXTRA_FILES` (if anybody does‚Ä¶) 

[09:17:39.0535] <annevk>
Please leave your sense of logic at the door, bring your emoji

[09:18:46.0345] <miketayl_r>
it seems like we can tell the bikeshed API to ignore errors, but that's probably a terrible solution, https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/#curl

[09:19:19.0072] <wanderview>
hello

[09:19:34.0275] <annevk>
miketayl_r: can you file an issue against whatwg/whatwg.org?

[09:19:42.0217] <miketayl_r>
annevk: yeah, np

[09:19:45.0906] <wanderview>
I was somewhat hoping to have this chat and the mozilla chat in the same tab, but I guess they are on separate servers

[09:20:09.0437] <annevk>
It seems like Bikeshed is trying to find the files and maybe we deal with them after running bikeshed or some such

[09:20:23.0259] <annevk>
wanderview: you can keep them in the same tab

[09:20:58.0452] <miketayl_r>
yeah -- you can just add this as a new "channel"

[09:21:03.0135] <miketayl_r>
in ur existing moz setup

[09:21:03.0955] <annevk>
wanderview: in explore rooms you can add other servers to look in

[09:21:24.0290] <jgraham>
(assumign you're using the same account)

[09:21:30.0945] <annevk>
(I'm also working on getting us the whatwg:mozilla.org alias, but it's taking time)

[09:21:39.0300] <jgraham>
 * (assuming you're using the same account, I think)

[09:23:21.0088] <wanderview>
I see, thanks!

[09:23:35.0589] <wanderview>
I had different accounts... but I see I can now message asuth on his mozilla account, etc

[09:24:39.0041] <sideshowbarker>
miketayl_r: `./deploy.sh: line 99: $1: unbound variable` at https://github.com/whatwg/compat/pull/147/checks?check_run_id=2690411902#step:4:25 may or may not related to that later `No such file or directory: '/tmp/stroked-text.png'` error

[09:25:15.0340] <sideshowbarker>
and it is so very great that every time we post that link here, Karl appears

[09:26:27.0312] <sideshowbarker>
as far as I can see, the `deploy.sh` script expects to be called with some argument‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äî and anyway, https://github.com/whatwg/compat/blob/main/Makefile#L24 s not calling it any any argument

[09:27:46.0610] <sideshowbarker>
but the makefiles for other repos don‚Äôt call it with any argument either ‚Äî¬†see https://github.com/whatwg/dom/blob/main/Makefile#L23 ‚Äî so whoknows maybe it‚Äôs not a problem at all

[09:29:30.0720] <miketayl_r>
i just found that if i change `-F die-on=warning` to `F die-on=fatal`, it seems to work as expected

[09:29:34.0670] <wanderview>
will w3c still be using its irc server in the future?  for tpac, etc

[09:29:54.0431] <wanderview>
wondering if I should cancel my irccloud account

[09:30:31.0154] <sideshowbarker>
wanderview: yes w3c will still be using its server for the forseeable future

[09:30:37.0458] <hober>
> <@wanderview:matrix.org> I was somewhat hoping to have this chat and the mozilla chat in the same tab, but I guess they are on separate servers

I have them in the same tab

[09:31:52.0165] <sideshowbarker>
but some of us are hoping to move more channels from w3c irc and over to here ‚Äî e.g., jgraham is for the #testing channel

[09:33:02.0224] <sideshowbarker>
but there is gonna be some inertia against moving WG channels until we have rrsagent and zakim bot equivalents for matrix I guess

[09:33:55.0291] <sideshowbarker>
some groups very much rely on using irc for the meetings, and being able to generate meeting minutes easily with rrsagent, and manage the speaker queue with zakim

[09:37:15.0307] <sideshowbarker>
jgraham: about #testing, I guess you see that you and I both now have ops on the irc channel ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt know what good that does us as far as fixing the **FDNPK0PMG5N0 (IRC) and 246 others** channel name problem that foolip pointed out ‚Äî¬†@kegan:matrix.org seems to be the only person with admin perms to change that

[09:39:01.0937] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
You can link your matrix account to a user in a bridge IRC network, and I believe that should give you permissions to the matrix room

[09:39:02.0979] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/latest/usage.html#customising-your-experience

[09:39:32.0701] <sideshowbarker>
Andreu Botella (he/they): ah cool ‚Äî will try that

[09:44:04.0405] <annevk>
Yeah, I'm using a bridge for the testing channel. It has a weird room name though.

[09:44:58.0060] <sideshowbarker>
annevk: yeah I think we all have that **FDNPK0PMG5N0 (IRC) and 246 others** weird room name for it showing up

[09:45:37.0460] <sideshowbarker>
PSA: we now have timestamp-linkable logs for this channel at https://matrixlogs.bakkot.com/WHATWG/

[09:45:46.0006] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
Apparently matrix rooms don't _need_ to have a name: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#calculating-the-display-name-for-a-room

[09:46:19.0335] <sideshowbarker>
annevk: may be worth adding https://matrixlogs.bakkot.com/WHATWG/ to the topic

[09:47:15.0625] <sideshowbarker>
> <@andreubotella:mozilla.org> Apparently matrix rooms don't _need_ to have a name: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#calculating-the-display-name-for-a-room

ah yeah  think that‚Äôs the core problem ‚Äî that room somehow doesn‚Äôt have a name, so the clients (or some middle thing) end up computing it

[09:48:20.0558] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> wanderview: yes w3c will still be using its server for the forseeable future

having an official W3C Matrix bridge would be nice, though.

> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> but some of us are hoping to move more channels from w3c irc and over to here ‚Äî e.g., jgraham is for the #testing channel

#testing is kinda a specific case at this point, given it isn't really W3C related at this point. maybe we should just creating a #web-platform-tests:matrix.org for it and be done with it.

[09:54:49.0849] <sideshowbarker>
> <@gsnedders:mozilla.org> #testing is kinda a specific case at this point, given it isn't really W3C related at this point. maybe we should just creating a #web-platform-tests:matrix.org for it and be done with it.

sounds good to me ‚Äî¬†or even just #wpt:matrix.org

[09:57:31.0081] <sideshowbarker>
> <@gsnedders:mozilla.org> having an official W3C Matrix bridge would be nice, though.

about the general topic of w3c moving away from irc, https://github.com/w3c/modern-tooling/issues/16 is the place where that discussion has been taking place already ‚Äî for **6 years now**, since the time when Robin Berjon first opened it

[10:00:43.0498] <sideshowbarker>
I have been meaning to post a comment to that issue to propose that w3c set up its own matrix homeserver, with a list of reasons why that makes a lot more sense now ‚Äî including the fact that w3c peers orgs are on Matrix now: #whatwg:matrix.org and #tc39-general:matrix.org ‚Äî and even IETF, which has its own Matrix server, for #xmpp_hallway_jabber.ietf.org:matrix.organd all

[10:01:15.0388] <sideshowbarker>
the IETF matrix server is just a bridge to their jabber server ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still progress

[12:42:41.0572] <jgraham>
#wpt:matrix.org now exists

[14:44:52.0947] <miketayl_r>
lame, you can't add an emoji reaction to someone joining the room

[14:48:39.0349] <sideshowbarker>
well we need more than just emoji to celebrate karlcow finally showing up

I think running mdn-bcd-collector produces an edit for AbortSignal, so that‚Äôs worth checking out

[00:32:27.0948] <timothygu>
Chromium has a tracking issue for AbortSignal.abort() (https://crbug.com/1187117), but it seems to have stalled. I'm gonna try to pick up the work.

[01:21:11.0173] <sideshowbarker>
> <@foolip:matrix.org> I think running mdn-bcd-collector produces an edit for AbortSignal, so that‚Äôs worth checking out

Ah ok, will take a look

[01:22:01.0021] <foolip>
sideshowbarker: actually I was wrong, just checked

[01:43:11.0563] <jgraham>
So I guess Chromium doesn't really still use IRC (https://www.chromium.org/developers/irc) but does it actually have any widely used public chat system these days?

[01:45:05.0078] <freddy>
I was asking a googler with whom I am collaborating that the externally-facing chat is an invite-only slack and there's an internal-only chat where all the conversations happen. (but maybe there's another externally-facing I don't know)

[02:33:54.0073] <sideshowbarker>
> <@timothygu:matrix.org> It looks like Safari Technical Preview has AbortSignal.abort(). https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223071

Thanks ‚Äî we unfortunately don‚Äôt yet have a way to represent data for Safari Technical Preview in BCD (though I think we will soon). But regardless it‚Äôs great know we do actually have two implementations.

[02:35:25.0486] <foolip>
sideshowbarker: https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10334 should be done soonish, Florian Scholz says that the remaining work is to update the BCD rendering code in yari.

[02:35:49.0128] <foolip>
(To use a different color and show strings like "Nightly" for these entries.)

[02:38:32.0862] <sideshowbarker>
foolip: by the way, once that PR lands, and we get some STP data into BCD, do you still want to also have the `implementation_url` thing I proposed?

[02:39:32.0763] <foolip>
sideshowbarker: I'd still use that occasionally I think, but TBH perhaps more for ancient stuff to show work than for new things which can more easily be tested.

[03:01:20.0335] <Florian Scholz>
Given I hear about "preview" data almost daily now, I'm going to work on it soonish. Promised :)

[03:05:01.0391] <foolip>
No pressure, I'm just very exited üòÄ

2021-06-04
[19:07:45.0345] <EveryOS>
I joined the Matrix server, this looks kind of like a hybrid between IRC and Discord.
I see not everybody has swapped over yet, as according to the member list.

[21:02:06.0649] <sideshowbarker>
Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]: Was thinking about something last night, and trying to remember: Do I recall correctly that back in the day ‚Äî before Bikeshed and Respec came along, back when the CSS WG was using Bert Bos‚Äôs ‚ÄúCSS preprocessor‚Äù service ‚Äî you were the one who came up with a workalike for that tool/service of Bert‚Äôs. And that was first such tool that we started to use for other  specs. Right?

[21:06:24.0110] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
sideshowbarker: Anolis, yes. Hixie stopped using it for HTML in 2014, so not that long before he stopped editing it, which is around the same time as Bikeshed and Respec were happening IIRC.

[21:06:49.0330] <sideshowbarker>
ah yes, ‚ÄúAnolis‚Äù, of course

[21:07:02.0675] <sideshowbarker>
it was so long ago that I had forgotten the name

[21:07:22.0780] <sideshowbarker>
but that name brings it all back ‚Äî that was great name

[21:08:07.0742] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
I can't quite remember where that came from. I expect some discussion in here?

[21:08:20.0439] <sideshowbarker>
no idea now

[21:08:35.0037] <sideshowbarker>
and I had sorta forgotten that Hixie had been using it for the HTML spec ‚Äî but I guess he must have used it for years

[21:09:01.0252] <sideshowbarker>
like, at least 5 years, he was using it to generate the published HTML spec

[21:10:19.0006] <sideshowbarker>
I am disappointed in myself for forgetting ‚Äî that was a pretty key tool for all those years

[21:11:15.0972] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
I think I wrote it partly to have tools that didn't rely on having access to the W3C CSS WG servers, and partly because Hixie was annoyed at how long they were taking as the HTML spec got ever bigger!

[21:12:02.0042] <sideshowbarker>
yeah the code for Bert‚Äôs thing was actually all bash/sed/etc

[21:12:26.0864] <sideshowbarker>
It was good that it was only exposed as a web service ‚Äî people would have been baffled by that code

[21:13:34.0431] <sideshowbarker>
I mean, I liked that code myself, but I think you had to be from a certain earlier era to not find it a giant WTF

[21:14:58.0525] <sideshowbarker>
anyway, Anolis was a nice piece of work

[21:16:18.0848] <sideshowbarker>
I now don‚Äôt recall why we didn‚Äôt start using it for specs other than HTML ‚Äî why Bikeshed became necessary ‚Äî but I vaguely recall that being because Anolis ended up being pretty tightly coupled to the quirks for the source of the HTML spec

[21:16:52.0154] <sideshowbarker>
not easily generalizable/portable to use for other specs, maybe?

[21:17:33.0235] <GPHemsley>
we totally used Anolis for other specs

[21:17:38.0520] <GPHemsley>
mimesniff started in anolis

[21:17:42.0746] <sideshowbarker>
ah OK

[21:18:23.0344] <sideshowbarker>
I seem to have pushed all knowledge of this stuff way into the back of my memory

[21:18:31.0678] <sideshowbarker>
tape storage

[21:18:57.0336] <GPHemsley>
looks like the conversion, at least for mimesniff, happened in 2016

[21:19:18.0314] <sideshowbarker>
OK

[21:19:24.0219] <GPHemsley>
I assume we switched to bikeshed because it supported more things

[21:19:32.0612] <GPHemsley>
(I wasn't involved in the conversion)

[21:20:47.0815] <sideshowbarker>
hmm among my other vague recollections is that Sam got tired of maintaining Anolis and didn‚Äôt like fixing bugs in it any more, something like that

[21:21:10.0997] <GPHemsley>
could be

[21:21:18.0012] <GPHemsley>
and Tab was busy doing stuff for CSS

[21:21:27.0086] <GPHemsley>
so it was already there

[21:21:48.0150] <sideshowbarker>
yeah, something like that

[21:25:04.0769] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
Bikeshed quickly got features that Anolis didn't have, and I had long ago stopped really maintaining it (Ms2ger maintained it for a while).

[21:25:40.0106] <GPHemsley>
oh yes, Ms2ger was maintainer when I was editing, I think

[21:25:48.0994] <GPHemsley>
looks like encoding started in anolis too

[21:27:58.0210] <GPHemsley>
probably others, but I'll stop digging

[21:28:26.0750] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
Plenty of others; virtually everything written between 2008 and 2013 or so used it.

[21:29:10.0408] <GPHemsley>
right

[21:32:15.0894] <GPHemsley>
oh wow, turns out I submitted quite a few PRs to anolis

[21:33:31.0989] <karlcow>
was it partly https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/

[21:33:39.0367] <karlcow>

[21:50:39.0968] <karlcow>

[21:50:59.0603] <sideshowbarker>
aha

[22:11:11.0842] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
> <@karlcow:mozilla.org> was it partly https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/

it was based on that, albeit a fair bit developed beyond there IIRC

[22:12:26.0433] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
those, the CSS 2 build system, and the CSS3 module post processor are all ultimately from a common source AFAIK, but have vastly diverged since (e.g. several of the tools have been rewritten multiple times)

[22:12:38.0023] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>

I doubt that I was even aware of the spec's existence when I was 14. I may or may not have been interested in browserdev by then, but certainly did not have the skills to do anything in that field.

done be discouraged by that though, Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders] was a real outlier in this respect - I think annevk  and Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders] were like the youngest people in standards maybe?

Gotcha, interesting
I take it the minimum age for somebody is 13, as usual? Surprisingly, I did not see any rules about that.

[12:46:03.0571] <bkardell>
Good question?! Idk?

[12:47:37.0867] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
I imagine there's a minimum age at which someone can sign the participant agreement

[12:49:04.0787] <sideshowbarker>
Andreu Botella (he/they): not any minimum age explicitly stated anywhere ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt think the form for signing the participant agreement asks anything about age

[12:49:52.0579] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
I was talking more about consent stuff depending on the legislation

[12:50:11.0601] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
 * I was talking more about consent stuff depending on the jurisdiction

[12:50:47.0458] <sideshowbarker>
I guess that must be bound by whatever the minimum age is ‚Äî in the signer‚Äôs jurisdiction ‚Äî  for signing any legal agreement or contract or whatever

[12:51:27.0992] <sideshowbarker>
I imagine that must be age 18 in most places. But now that I think of it, in Japan at least it might actually be age 20

[12:52:10.0704] <sideshowbarker>

[12:53:47.0500] <jgraham>
There also seems to be a US law about not collecting personal information of under 13s without parental consent. That might make it difficult to sign up for services like GitHub.

While I'm now 18, I had signed it when I was 17 :/
I failed I guess
I haven't actually done any contributing yet, other than a simple issue I had opened on the Github issues page :/

Issues are still contributions

[13:05:24.0446] <sideshowbarker>
finding spec bugs and reporting them is a pretty useful thing

[13:05:32.0798] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
But the participant agreement only matters for PRs

[13:05:38.0287] <sideshowbarker>
right

[13:06:17.0249] <EveryOS>
Ah, ok

[13:07:15.0016] <sideshowbarker>
so if you have patents on something, you can just raise an issue describing the change you want to get into the spec, including some idea you a patent for, and then wait until somebody else actually writes up a patch for it üòã

[13:08:01.0748] <sideshowbarker>
and then after Google and Apple implement it and ship it, you wait a few years and then start going after them for royalties

[13:08:37.0584] <sideshowbarker>
and since you never signed the participant agreement, you‚Äôre not preventing from being able to do that

[13:08:52.0979] <sideshowbarker>

but we actually had no participant agreement for the first two years after the spec was moved into github and we started accepting PRs and patches

anyway, it‚Äôs also worth remembering that for the 11 years from 2004 to 2015, even though the spec wasn‚Äôt under public version control, there were major features that went into it which were at least in part based on proposals from third parties (or in some cases, the design of the entire feature was largely the work of a third party)

[13:19:19.0815] <sideshowbarker>
in other words, the bulk of the spec ‚Äî and we have no RF commitments for any of that

[13:20:22.0028] <sideshowbarker>
but we operated that way for 13-14 years without anybody ever seeing it as a major problem

[13:22:55.0630] <foolip>

We do have commitments for all of the various W3C publications and WHATWG review drafts. Just not necessarily from those who originally came up with it, which isn‚Äôt strictly guaranteed now either.

[13:23:11.0608] <sideshowbarker>
sure

[13:24:24.0638] <sideshowbarker>
but what bothers me some is the giant new barrier we created for new contributors

[13:24:52.0783] <sideshowbarker>
 for 14 years we operated with effectively zero barrier of entry for new contributors

[13:25:50.0728] <sideshowbarker>
but then we decided we needed RF commitments for everything, so we unilaterally put the participant agreement in place

[13:26:20.0870] <sideshowbarker>
‚Ä¶and with that we suddenly went from zero barrier of entry to massive barrier of entry

[13:26:21.0964] <EveryOS>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> but what bothers me some is the giant new barrier we created for new contributors

The agreement? That wasn't too hard to read and sign.

I feel like I've asked before, but have forgotten.

[13:28:30.0578] <sideshowbarker>

Yes ‚Äî we can be grateful to the WHATWG SG for recognizing the difficulties and making some mitigations to the rules

[13:30:04.0723] <sideshowbarker>
‚Ä¶but it has taken them literally years to get around to finally doing that

[13:31:33.0266] <sideshowbarker>
I also want to note that the wider WHATWG community was never actually asked, *‚ÄúDo you think we should put a requirement for a participant agreement in place? And if so, what do you think the termsof it should be?‚Äù*

[13:32:34.0276] <sideshowbarker>
we did it without asking the community about it, and zero opportunity for the community to give feedback about it

and IMHO even if the community had been asked about the idea participant agreement, and consensus from the community had been that, yeah, it‚Äôs a good idea to have a participant agreement ‚Äî even then, the actual concrete participant agreement that ended up being put in place is not something the community would have found to be optimal for facilitating the same kind of participation we‚Äôd had for the previous 13-14 years

FWIW I agree that we failed to strike a good balance, and am embarrassed at how slow we are in improving it.

Yes, absolutely! But you can start with the easier cases, like short algorithms that don‚Äôt depend on a lot of other things. Once you become familiar with the conventions you‚Äôll be able to make sense of bigger and bigger chunks of stuff. And then, TBH, there are a lot of things which are really just broken and don‚Äôt make sense, so don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt understand! Almost everything is broken if you look closely.

[13:49:31.0928] <hober>
hence the "please leave your sense of logic at the door" in the topic

[13:50:38.0584] <foolip>

HTTP is a pain to work with, and eventually I'm gonna have to refactor everything to play nicely with the streams spec.

I made it during December/January, when people were on break. I had a question about how a certain WPT test coincided with the CSS standards. The behaviour of the spec didn't seem to match up with that of the WPT test. Nobody was around to answer my question,so I took my best guess. I then wrote and submitted a PR that passed both that WPT test and related WPT tests. After I submitted it to be reviewed, you can guess what happened. Eventually, I ended up pressing the abandon button as it was very obviously not going to be accepted.

markdown is at least better than the weird HTML-but-not thing that the HTML spec uses

[01:57:47.0181] <sideshowbarker>
another thing we‚Äôve been doing for the MDN sources in preparation for moving to markdown is, trying to figure out if/how to replace background colors in tables with something that achieves the same effect

[01:58:37.0931] <sideshowbarker>
an example of something that got changed for that reason is the **Sameness Comparisons** table at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#a_model_for_understanding_equality_comparisons

[01:59:04.0163] <sideshowbarker>
previously the cells there had either green or red backgrounds

[01:59:33.0584] <sideshowbarker>
but it got replaced with  ‚úÖ U+2705 WHITE HEAVY CHECK MARK and  ‚ùå U+274C CROSS MARK emoji

[02:00:13.0167] <sideshowbarker>

Just spotted https://html.spec.whatwg.org still says "Join us on IRC, #whatwg on Freenode", which links to https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC which redirects to https://whatwg.org/irc, but both should probably redirect to https://whatwg.org/chat and the spec page also just link to /chat and say 'Chat with us, Matrix or IRC', or similar. Not exactly urgent :-)

[05:54:59.0224] <Piers Wombwell>

First, its impressive whenever an external person shows up with a CL in crbug.  Second, its extra impressive for someone to take a vague 1-line problem statement and turn it into a complete working solution.  So well done!  (And I work at google and often can't get UX feedback because they are so busy, so extra well done for engaging so well with them!)

in this modern era, is there a way to display an svg without opening yourself up to arbitrary js

[18:09:29.0798] <Max>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> Max: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#dom-img-naturalwidth maybe

I think you'll find those properties are the dimensions *after* browser intervention, and do not necessarily reflect the dimensions of the image in the file on the server.

[18:11:17.0101] <Max>
Checkout this PR:
https://pr5734.content.dev.mdn.mozit.cloud/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/naturalWidth

[18:11:38.0300] <Max>
"Note: Most of the the time the natural width is the actual width of the image sent by the server. Nevertheless, browsers can modify an image before pushing it to the renderer. For example, Chrome degrades the resolution of images on low-end devices. In such cases, naturalWidth will consider the width of the image modified by such browser interventions as the natural width, and returns this value."

[18:12:46.0406] <Max>
It would be very useful, I think, so have an API that returned the width of the image in the file that is downloaded, prior to browser interventions.

> <@davidmaxwaterman:matrix.org> It would be very useful, I think, so have an API that returned the width of the image in the file that is downloaded, prior to browser interventions.

Does anyone else think this would be useful too? ...or is it basically 'not going to happen'?

[02:17:33.0390] <zcorpan>
Max: the spec doesn't account for browser interventions for low memory devices. Maybe it could be argued that such interventions should not have observable effects on APIs such as naturalWidth

[02:23:42.0673] <zcorpan>
But since the intervention seems to be to make images smaller to not run out of memory, maybe there's no great option. The spec could allow it to happen and expose a new property to let the page know that it did (and how much it was scaled)

[02:25:06.0057] <Max>
yeah. I'm really just looking for the information provided in the dev tools - I forget exactly the wording, but the information is there, so I guess it's available somewhere.

[02:25:54.0427] <zcorpan>
Max: see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1187043#c9

[02:29:45.0588] <Max>
ah, dev tools says 'intrinsic size' and that remains the 'correct' size :)

[02:30:15.0960] <Max>
> <@zcorpan_:matrix.org> Max: see https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1187043#c9

Yeah, that's my bug ;)

[02:30:52.0210] <Max>
I realise "there are ways"...just feel like it would be good to just expose the information since it's already there (assuming it is)

[02:31:37.0259] <Max>
I suppose I'm wondering how certain the 'AFAIK/CT' is in that message...

[02:32:06.0712] <zcorpan>
Max: I assume fs looked at the code

[02:33:20.0548] <Max>
ok, fair enough. I already 'worked around' my actual issue...just following it up to see if there's any chance of getting the raw data in an api...perhaps there are more importnat things.

[02:37:20.0424] <zcorpan>
changes are always possible. I don't know if an API for this is a good thing long-term. I've added a comment in the chromium issue

[02:41:43.0347] <Max>
ok, thanks for that.

[02:47:11.0636] <Max>
Note that I'm not concerned about the UA scaling the image down, just that I have the dimensions of the original...

[02:47:28.0474] <Max>
but anyway, I think I'm done with that. Thanks for your attention.

[02:50:28.0207] <zcorpan>
sure, but it could break other pages that don't know about this happening. trying to apply first principles, that interventions like this should be unobservable to the page if possible :)

[02:58:53.0426] <Luca Casonato>
annevk: Is there consensus that a proposal for adding base64 encoding to `TextEncoder` / `TextDecoder` would be rejected? If not I'd like to write up a proposal.

[02:59:18.0552] <Luca Casonato>
Only reference public issue somewhat related I could find is https://github.com/whatwg/encoding/issues/138

[03:01:32.0010] <Luca Casonato>
I assume this has been discussed before and rejected because semantically using a TextEncoder to _decode_ base64 is kinda strange.

[03:12:36.0015] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
Luca Casonato: The encoding standard and the `TextDecoder`/Encoder APIs are for _character_ encodings, not something like base64.

[03:13:03.0821] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
Even isomorphic encoding, which is technically a character encoding (Latin-1) is not a good fit for the standard as per the bug you linked.

[03:14:16.0532] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
But I guess some version of `atob` that works on buffers could be added to the HTML spec

[03:15:13.0726] <Luca Casonato>
Makes sense. Maybe a new BinaryEncoder / BinaryDecoder that can do base64 / hex?

[03:15:40.0333] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
That might work

[04:16:48.0085] <sideshowbarker>
timothygu++ for https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/97d5f5cd25bf571c42ab167980873471389d0959

[05:46:31.0924] <annevk>
Luca Casonato: there's variants of base64 (see also Infra) so that's something that needs solving too

[05:48:09.0137] <annevk>
Luca Casonato: apart from what Andreu Botella (he/they) said it also ends up being a mismatch with the terms; text encode is string -> bytes, but base64 encode is bytes -> string

[06:01:53.0076] <Luca Casonato>
Makes sense. I‚Äôll write up a little doc on the problem

[12:12:45.0558] <Luca Casonato>
Started on a little proposal: https://github.com/lucacasonato/proposal-binary-encoding. Probably not great though - don't really know what the standard practice for new proposals is though. Are there some recent pre-standardization WHATWG proposals out there to look at?


2021-06-10
[00:19:35.0237] <annevk>
Luca Casonato: that looks pretty great; one thing that can help with things like this is a comparison with other programming languages; also curious if we need streaming (guess not, but might be worth calling out in a FAQ or some such)

[00:40:52.0038] <Luca Casonato>
annevk Thanks for the feedback! I'll add an FAQ, and a section on other languages' implementations. There is a comment about streaming in the doc - I think the best way to implement streaming would be a seperate `BinaryEncoderStream` / `BinaryDecoderStream` akin to the text encoders.

[00:42:06.0479] <Luca Casonato>
But maybe a synchronous capable streaming API would make sense too? That could be added via a `stream: true` in an options bag to `encode` / `decode` / `decodeInto`.

[00:42:27.0109] <Luca Casonato>
Anyway - will put tjhese comments into an issue and link to it from the FAQ.

[02:30:06.0337] <Luca Casonato>
annevk FAQ and language/environment comparison added.

[05:08:07.0557] <annevk>
Luca Casonato: I'd also ask MattiasBuelens and ricea for review

[09:26:34.0050] <tabatkins>
fwiw, isn't base64-encode still bytes -> bytes? The output bytes are chosen to be displayable as ASCII, but it's not "text"; there's no codepoints involved.

[09:26:50.0155] <tabatkins>
(You wouldn't then encode base64 "text" as utf-16, for example.)

[09:38:26.0159] <jgraham>
That seems technically true, but the usual use case for base64 is where you need a Text type (e.g. for JSON). So thinking of it as a bytes -> Text transformation fits the use cases better

[09:40:36.0769] <jgraham>
(and if the whole payload including the base64 part was then going to be encoded as UTF-16 that's what you'd do, not embed the base64 bytes directly in a UTF-16 message)

[08:29:10.0450] <annevk>

Yes, I still need to do that ‚Äî as we did for the obsolete DOM specs 

[23:15:42.0455] <sideshowbarker>
I‚Äôve done some of the HTML ones, but need to audit against that list to get them all

[08:05:07.0639] <sideshowbarker>
looking at https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/6009

[08:06:00.0694] <sideshowbarker>
can anybody suggest a test case/demo that would demonstrate an empty string for `location.pathname`?

[08:07:13.0486] <sideshowbarker>
when a browser navigates you to a particular site, it‚Äôs got to have a path, right?

[08:07:28.0213] <Domenic>
Maybe data:

[08:07:32.0658] <sideshowbarker>
how can you navigate to a URL that doesn‚Äôt have a path?

[08:08:19.0629] <Domenic>
Neither Chrome nor Firefox allow navigating to data: though

[08:08:48.0397] <sideshowbarker>
in other words, is it actually possible in practice for `location.pathname` to be the empty string rather than an actual path?

[08:09:07.0652] <Domenic>
In the current browsers that I am testing with it does not seem to be possible

[08:09:12.0275] <Domenic>
But it's not prohibited per spec

[08:09:36.0161] <Domenic>
Oh

[08:09:42.0091] <Domenic>
In Firefox about:blank has empty pathname

[08:09:46.0929] <Domenic>
(Per spec pathname should be "blank")

[08:10:08.0419] <Domenic>
Wait no

[08:10:21.0821] <Domenic>
Using `new URL()` about:blank has empty pathname, but using `Location` it has `blank` as the pathname

[08:12:36.0385] <sideshowbarker>
yeah OK that is reassuring :)


[08:12:44.0446] <sideshowbarker>
I guess the MDN article is just trying to say too much here

[08:13:45.0459] <sideshowbarker>
at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/history.html#dom-location-pathname-dev the spec just says:
> Returns the Location object's URL's path.

[08:14:05.0571] <sideshowbarker>
I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs useful to say anything more than that

[08:14:32.0464] <sideshowbarker>
hmm, well, I see now the MDN article doesn‚Äôt mention setting it, though the spec does

[08:15:15.0323] <sideshowbarker>
the fact that it can be set and that setting it causes a navigation is pretty useful info

[08:15:34.0236] <sideshowbarker>
> Can be set, to navigate to the same URL with a changed path.

[08:16:38.0288] <sideshowbarker>
hmm, though ‚Äúsame URL with a changed path‚Äù¬†maybe it not the greatest wording ‚Äî if the path changes, it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúsame URL‚Äù any more

[09:41:28.0987] <wanderview>
`new URL("data:")` has an empty pathname and is valid in spec and chrome at least

[09:42:41.0779] <sideshowbarker>
But is that a location? Can you navigate to it?

[10:34:27.0002] <wanderview>
are navigations limited to special schemes or something?  otherwise anything that uses a custom scheme can have an empty path

[10:34:56.0955] <Domenic>
Yeah above I was trying to test non-special schemes and didn't find any that a browser could navigate to

[10:35:33.0405] <Domenic>
But there's nothing prohibiting such navigations.

[10:36:22.0116] <Domenic>
Maybe if you launched the browser from the command line...

[10:36:53.0543] <wanderview>
or a redirect?

[10:37:15.0641] <wanderview>
or an extension helping with the navigation

[10:39:37.0125] <Domenic>
Navigate can either go to a fetch scheme (about, blob, data, file, http, https) or javascript: or ends up in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#process-a-navigate-url-scheme . The latter will always result in an opaque-origin page so unless the page itself gets to run JS nobody will be able to observe location.pathname being empty string. So that's why I was focused on about, data, and javascript.

[10:40:31.0396] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
This reminds me, has there been any progress on defining "navigation specifically through the URL bar"?

[10:42:01.0449] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
Or I guess opening the browser from the command line should have the same result, minus creating the browsing context

[10:43:20.0009] <Domenic>
Command line and URL bar are different it turns out since the URL bar does searches

[10:43:37.0748] <Domenic>
So `javascript:` from command line opened the new tab page whereas typing that in the URL bar did a search

[10:44:03.0234] <Domenic>
Anyway defining navigation through the URL bar is somewhat happening, see https://wicg.github.io/app-history/#user-initiated-patches

[10:45:12.0082] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
I thought the specs could ignore the URL bar search, treating it as "navigation through the URL bar" to the search engine

[10:45:24.0339] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
Testing that would be trickier though

[10:46:24.0194] <Domenic>
Agreed they'd ignore the distinction, just saying that it turns out they are different and that made trying to generate degenerate empty-path pages tricky :)

annevk: jgraham: apparently you can make rooms have avatars; we should make the WHATWG logo this room's avatar.

It is

[13:30:04.0642] <Domenic>
Hmm, not for me, even after reloading; rather curious.

[13:30:25.0402] <Luca Casonato>
Yeah, isn't for me either.

[13:30:53.0624] <timothygu>
Ah, but if one clicks on the icon, the avatar shows up

[13:31:05.0060] <timothygu>
I'm guessing the avatar is SVG, which only some clients support :')

[13:31:08.0094] <Luca Casonato>
Oh, very interesting: https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/thumbnail/mozilla.org/56b9d49c31be7d13714fa95e8c4674a4ea58d745?width=96&height=96&method=crop

[13:31:14.0037] <Luca Casonato>
seems the icon lives on mozilla.org?

[13:31:36.0857] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
/me dives into the matrix specs

[13:32:28.0558] <Luca Casonato>
i was sort of expecting the icon to live on the same server as the room itself (matrix.org afaik for this room)

[13:32:38.0531] <Luca Casonato>
anyway, i have no idea how matrix works lol

[13:32:54.0833] <timothygu>
Nah, we had the same issue over on #jsdom:matrix.org 

[13:33:09.0474] <timothygu>
SVG only shows up in some cases. PNG works everywhere.

[13:38:43.0405] <Luca Casonato>
Domenic: Working on some streams spec impl fixes in Deno, but I am running into a case where `WritableStreamDefaultController[[AbortAlgorithm]]` is undefined when calling `WritableStreamDefaultController[[AbortSteps]]` in `WritableStreamFinishErroring` because `WritableStreamDefaultControllerError` called `WritableStreamDefaultControllerClearAlgorithms` before calling `WritableStreamStartErroring`. Could this be a spec issue?

[13:39:56.0706] <Domenic>
Luca Casonato: it seems unlikely as I think that code path is well-tested in the reference implementation but it's always possible. I'd suggest opening an issue on whatwg/streams so folks can dive in when they have time.

After some more digging, it does seem to be a spec issue. https://github.com/whatwg/streams/pull/1137

Regarding the participant agreement - it got it signed a few weeks ago, but it hasn't been verified yet. Who can I ping for that? :-)

[14:56:19.0011] <Domenic>
I just verified it; we generally verify it the first time it's needed.

[14:56:22.0828] <Luca Casonato>
Ah I see you just did it, thanks :-)

Huh, apparently the matrix.org homeserver is buggy when making thumbnails for SVG images, but the mozilla.org homeserver isn't

[23:36:21.0573] <annevk>
Domenic: you should be able to navigate a nested context to a data: URL (there's an open PR by me on forbidding it for top-level contexts with some open questions)

[23:37:35.0168] <annevk>
(I changed the avatar to a PNG)

[00:01:19.0919] <DerekNonGeneric>
wfm

[00:02:18.0198] <DerekNonGeneric>
fwf, i know for a fact svgs work since that is what i used for my own room

[00:03:16.0920] <DerekNonGeneric>
no clue if there are attributes missing on y'alls (perhaps a case of over-optimization)

[00:06:04.0917] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
The issue is https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/1309

[00:06:43.0359] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
I don't know why it works on mozilla.org though, since it also seems to use Synapse

[00:11:36.0019] <DerekNonGeneric>
tbh, not entirely sure how important it is to have a non-lossy image format at this point

[00:13:30.0773] <DerekNonGeneric>
guess the room preview @ https://matrix.to/#/#whatwg:matrix.org will remain relatively small

[00:14:56.0206] <DerekNonGeneric>
oh, but when you click on the room image in the element web app it takes up _the entire_ screen 

[00:15:11.0651] <DerekNonGeneric>
oof, that is less than ideal

Rooms exist on all participating servers at the same time; media such as images are also duplicated. You can replace matrix-client.matrix.org by any other participating homeserver and still get the media. For instance, [here is the room logo on my server](https://mayeul.net/_matrix/media/r0/download/mozilla.org/cab85c2fc275cb19f0276f7dd2ba4af349b0223f), [KDE's](https://kde.modular.im/_matrix/media/r0/download/mozilla.org/cab85c2fc275cb19f0276f7dd2ba4af349b0223f), [Mozilla's](https://mozilla.modular.im/_matrix/media/r0/download/mozilla.org/cab85c2fc275cb19f0276f7dd2ba4af349b0223f).

And your client fetches the media from your own homeserver (which will fetch it from the federation if not available; currently synapse only asks the originating homeserver).

Andreu Botella (he/they): can you give me an example of it working on mozilla.org? do you mean `chat.mozilla.org?`

[01:21:21.0797] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
Right now the logo is a PNG, but If you have your user account registered on the mozilla.org homeserver, you could see the logo before
