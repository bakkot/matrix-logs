I made a bot for rendering better (i.e., linkable) logs for matrix channels, for tc39's use. if ya'll would like I can have it do this channel too. currently logs are at https://bakkot.github.io/matrix-logs/, or you can run it yourself from https://github.com/bakkot/matrix-archive-bot

[18:26:35.0141] <bakkot>
logs are going to be a bit behind because I'm not bothering to have it monitor continuously

It'd be great to have it log this channel too

For anybody here interested in helping improve content at MDN, https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/5523 is maybe a good first issue that would probably take only 30 minutes or so of work

[21:56:36.0433] <sideshowbarker>
The work would be writing some additional text that elaborates on the following statement:
> Setting the value of `location.href` _navigates_ to the provided URL. If you want _redirection_, use `location.replace()`

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> zcorpan_: there was already a zcorpan without underscore? :-)

 Yes. I signed up in 2019. Since then the account has been deactivated, not sure why. Don't know if it's possible to reactivate it :-(

[00:48:47.0417] <annevk>
zcorpan_: ah, sucks. You could probably find another server as well if you want and get an account there, but not sure how much effort you want to put into it.

[00:51:28.0674] <zcorpan_>
annevk: I'll wait until someone tells me it's possible to reclaim the old name :)

[00:53:50.0281] <MayeulC>
Well, you can still change your display name to one without the underscore.

I wish Matrix had "done" / "ack" / "this" / etc. reactions besides emoji.

[04:48:13.0719] <sideshowbarker>
Per that discussion, you can do it already in some Matrix clients

[04:48:38.0115] <sideshowbarker>
...just not in Element

[05:28:47.0221] <MayeulC>
I reacted with a few frequently-used examples:

* ‚ûï for +1
* ‚úÖ for done
* üßæ for ack
* ‚òùÔ∏èor üëÜÔ∏è for this

You can send custom events via devtools in element, but it's a hassle. At the end of the day, it's a matter of convention. I quite liked some CI bot that indicated runner status with üü¢ üî¥ üü†.

[05:29:29.0711] <ryzokuken>
Fluffychat has pretty solid support for custom emotes already.

Hi, a new day and a fresh set of eyes, I noticed what I was looking for yesterday staring me right in the face: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus-fixup-rule. Would you agree the correct behaviour is actually the other way around to what we discussed yesterday?

[08:55:45.0277] <lpd>
The language "removed from that Document in some way" seems pretty weird to me, but the examples are clear.

[08:55:53.0001] <lpd>
 * The language "removed from that Document in some way" seems pretty weird to me, but the examples are clear in my novice reading.

[08:56:21.0616] <annevk>
lpd: none of the examples are about rendering though, but that is indeed extremely ambiguous; it likely wouldn't pass review if written today

[08:58:33.0853] <lpd>
annevk: In the main text, I believe it's covered by "it stops being a focusable area", since for an input element to be a focusable area it must meet "the element is either being rendered or being used as relevant canvas fallback content."

[08:58:53.0570] <annevk>
I guess focusable area is defined in terms of being rendered, yeah

[08:59:56.0212] <lpd>
The example box specifically mentions the `hidden` attribute, but I'm not sure if those are normative?

[09:00:01.0561] <annevk>
However, it doesn't seem to invoke an algorithm to change the focused area, meaning no events would dispatch and such and it's a bit unclear what state would change

[09:00:30.0237] <annevk>
Examples are non-normative, but they're also not supposed to be wrong :-)

[09:00:49.0255] <annevk>
lpd: I guess at this point I'd lean towards an issue against whatwg/html though

[09:01:06.0033] <annevk>
/me wonders if there is one already

[09:03:22.0313] <annevk>
(I only found other issues)

> designate the Document's viewport to be the new focused area of the document
annevk I believe the confusion comes from this, right? Whether this requires the **focusing steps** are run?

I wonder if others are getting 500 errors and other weirdness from GitHub right now

[01:28:27.0188] <foolip>
It's not entirely like normal for me. Pushing a new branch didn't give the URL to create a PR from it, so something internally isn't working.

[01:28:58.0302] <sideshowbarker>
oh foolip good timing 

[01:29:13.0016] <foolip>
I'm trying to make a PR for you actually :)

[01:29:14.0483] <sideshowbarker>
I am actually trying to review https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10717

[01:29:37.0119] <foolip>
Ah, trying to approve gives you a 500?

[01:30:04.0851] <sideshowbarker>
worse ‚Äî can‚Äôt even navigate to https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10717/files

[01:30:32.0540] <sideshowbarker>
oh wow that‚Äôs a bonus of moving away from IRC, right there

[01:30:50.0114] <foolip>
Inline preview of URLs? Yeah that's great.

[01:30:58.0779] <foolip>
So trying to create a new PR gives me a 500.

[01:31:59.0779] <foolip>
And I guess I won't try to hammer it because maybe it actually has been created...

[01:32:15.0427] <sideshowbarker>
> <@foolip:matrix.org> Inline preview of URLs? Yeah that's great.

I mean that photo ‚Äî that guy who was so happy,  so blissfully unaware that he‚Äôs about to start getting 500 errors himself

[01:32:46.0970] <sideshowbarker>
> <@foolip:matrix.org> And I guess I won't try to hammer it because maybe it actually has been created...

https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10717 did for sure get created

/me checks his notifications for any other PR that might also have rolled in

[01:33:38.0566] <foolip>
I'm trying to create another PR, for every other BCD PR I review I discover something adjacent that's wrong. A never-ending rabbit hole.

hah ‚Äî yep, I know that particular rabbit hole very well

[03:35:49.0151] <foolip>
sideshowbarker: sorted now it seems, I could create https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10720

Ok, will take a look

[04:01:09.0205] <sideshowbarker>
annevk Other than   AbortSignal.abort() and shadowing.delegatesFocus, are there any features in the DOM spec that have less than 2 implementations?

[04:09:47.0912] <annevk>
Nobody else shipped AbortSignal.abort() yet?
