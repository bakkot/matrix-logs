I made a bot for rendering better (i.e., linkable) logs for matrix channels, for tc39's use. if ya'll would like I can have it do this channel too. currently logs are at https://bakkot.github.io/matrix-logs/, or you can run it yourself from https://github.com/bakkot/matrix-archive-bot

[18:26:35.0141] <bakkot>
logs are going to be a bit behind because I'm not bothering to have it monitor continuously

For anybody here interested in helping improve content at MDN, https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/5523 is maybe a good first issue that would probably take only 30 minutes or so of work

[21:56:36.0433] <sideshowbarker>
The work would be writing some additional text that elaborates on the following statement:
> Setting the value of `location.href` _navigates_ to the provided URL. If you want _redirection_, use `location.replace()`

[00:46:37.0691] <zcorpan_>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> zcorpan_: there was already a zcorpan without underscore? :-)

 Yes. I signed up in 2019. Since then the account has been deactivated, not sure why. Don't know if it's possible to reactivate it :-(

[00:48:47.0417] <annevk>
zcorpan_: ah, sucks. You could probably find another server as well if you want and get an account there, but not sure how much effort you want to put into it.

[00:51:28.0674] <zcorpan_>
annevk: I'll wait until someone tells me it's possible to reclaim the old name :)

[00:53:50.0281] <MayeulC>
Well, you can still change your display name to one without the underscore.

I wish Matrix had "done" / "ack" / "this" / etc. reactions besides emoji.

https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/2648

[04:48:13.0719] <sideshowbarker>
Per that discussion, you can do it already in some Matrix clients

[04:48:38.0115] <sideshowbarker>
...just not in Element

[05:28:47.0221] <MayeulC>
I reacted with a few frequently-used examples:

* ‚ûï for +1
* ‚úÖ for done
* üßæ for ack
* ‚òùÔ∏èor üëÜÔ∏è for this

You can send custom events via devtools in element, but it's a hassle. At the end of the day, it's a matter of convention. I quite liked some CI bot that indicated runner status with üü¢ üî¥ üü†.

[05:29:29.0711] <ryzokuken>
Fluffychat has pretty solid support for custom emotes already.

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> lpd: per spec I think Chrome is wrong and I don't think there's an issue on changing this

Hi, a new day and a fresh set of eyes, I noticed what I was looking for yesterday staring me right in the face: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus-fixup-rule. Would you agree the correct behaviour is actually the other way around to what we discussed yesterday?

[08:55:45.0277] <lpd>
The language "removed from that Document in some way" seems pretty weird to me, but the examples are clear.

[08:55:53.0001] <lpd>
 * The language "removed from that Document in some way" seems pretty weird to me, but the examples are clear in my novice reading.

[08:56:21.0616] <annevk>
lpd: none of the examples are about rendering though, but that is indeed extremely ambiguous; it likely wouldn't pass review if written today

[08:58:33.0853] <lpd>
annevk: In the main text, I believe it's covered by "it stops being a focusable area", since for an input element to be a focusable area it must meet "the element is either being rendered or being used as relevant canvas fallback content."

[08:58:53.0570] <annevk>
I guess focusable area is defined in terms of being rendered, yeah

[08:59:56.0212] <lpd>
The example box specifically mentions the `hidden` attribute, but I'm not sure if those are normative?

[09:00:01.0561] <annevk>
However, it doesn't seem to invoke an algorithm to change the focused area, meaning no events would dispatch and such and it's a bit unclear what state would change

[09:00:30.0237] <annevk>
Examples are non-normative, but they're also not supposed to be wrong :-)

[09:00:49.0255] <annevk>
lpd: I guess at this point I'd lean towards an issue against whatwg/html though

[09:01:06.0033] <annevk>
/me wonders if there is one already

[09:03:22.0313] <annevk>
(I only found other issues)

[09:04:18.0931] <lpd>
> designate the Document's viewport to be the new focused area of the document
annevk I believe the confusion comes from this, right? Whether this requires the **focusing steps** are run?

I wonder if others are getting 500 errors and other weirdness from GitHub right now

[01:28:27.0188] <foolip>
It's not entirely like normal for me. Pushing a new branch didn't give the URL to create a PR from it, so something internally isn't working.

[01:28:58.0302] <sideshowbarker>
oh foolip good timing 

[01:29:13.0016] <foolip>
I'm trying to make a PR for you actually :)

[01:29:14.0483] <sideshowbarker>
I am actually trying to review https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10717

[01:29:37.0119] <foolip>
Ah, trying to approve gives you a 500?

[01:30:04.0851] <sideshowbarker>
worse ‚Äî can‚Äôt even navigate to https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10717/files

[01:30:32.0540] <sideshowbarker>
oh wow that‚Äôs a bonus of moving away from IRC, right there

[01:30:50.0114] <foolip>
Inline preview of URLs? Yeah that's great.

[01:30:58.0779] <foolip>
So trying to create a new PR gives me a 500.

[01:31:59.0779] <foolip>
And I guess I won't try to hammer it because maybe it actually has been created...

[01:32:15.0427] <sideshowbarker>

Ok, will take a look

[04:01:09.0205] <sideshowbarker>
annevk Other than   AbortSignal.abort() and shadowing.delegatesFocus, are there any features in the DOM spec that have less than 2 implementations?

[04:09:47.0912] <annevk>
Nobody else shipped AbortSignal.abort() yet?

[04:10:33.0871] <annevk>
In general though I'm not the best at keeping track of these things. If that's what wpt says I'd trust that. üòä

[04:18:39.0701] <sideshowbarker>
Ok

[08:57:50.0775] <miketayl_r>
sup everyone

[08:58:42.0521] <sideshowbarker>
howdy hey miketayl_r 

[08:59:09.0774] <miketayl_r>
(took me a minute to figure out how to add this room... i thought i would need to add a new server or something)

[08:59:11.0768] <miketayl_r>
web 4.0 is wild

[09:02:00.0065] <sideshowbarker>
miketayl_r: about that, we have a requirement here that you throw in as many emoji as possible into your messages and decorate other people‚Äôs messages with as many as possible

[09:02:12.0272] <miketayl_r>
i will do my best

[09:02:34.0481] <sideshowbarker>
OK cool ‚Äîbecause as you know, the answer to ‚ÄúWhat is web 4.0‚Äù is clearly: emoji

[09:02:50.0149] <miketayl_r>
i actually just learned that web 3.0 is crypto, https://blogs.opera.com/tips-and-tricks/2021/01/what-is-web-3-0-and-why-you-should-care/

[09:03:26.0168] <miketayl_r>
or maybe it's iot, i dunno

[09:04:04.0378] <sideshowbarker>
hmm, crypto + emoji = web 5.0?

[09:04:57.0393] <sideshowbarker>
you can also get more reputation points by posting giant superfluous images directly to the channel ‚Äî like at https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#whatwg:matrix.org/$CyvdZzCILRkt0d6OWU46KOgkZDua8XxPni328gm35j4

[09:05:31.0108] <miketayl_r>
the possibilities are endless

[09:06:35.0239] <sideshowbarker>
that‚Äôs the new addendum motto to your motto: *‚ÄúPlease leave your sense of logic at the door ‚Ä¶ the possibilities are endless‚Äù*

[09:06:54.0347] <sideshowbarker>
heh

[09:08:02.0516] <sideshowbarker>
and finally, note that wanderview arrived here one hour ahead of you, so he‚Äôs got that much extra reputation points already that he can spend

[09:08:21.0419] <sideshowbarker>
howdy wanderview too

[09:08:59.0816] <miketayl_r>
i assume the longer i idle, the more whatwg coin i mine

[09:10:17.0020] <miketayl_r>
ok, i have a real question, maybe for tabatkins -- it seems like the spec `make deploy` script gets sad if you have EXTRA_FILES -- it eventually calls `curlbikeshed` and then that errors out because it can't find those files (i guess it runs in `/tmp`)

[09:10:20.0439] <miketayl_r>
e.g., https://github.com/whatwg/compat/pull/147/checks?check_run_id=2690411902

[09:10:48.0505] <miketayl_r>
i wonder if anybody else has run into this yet

[09:11:11.0048] <miketayl_r>
https://compat.spec.whatwg.org/stroked-text.png is obviously v important

[09:13:18.0881] <hober>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> hmm, crypto + emoji = web 5.0?

wouldn't it be web 9.0? maybe i did the math wrong

[09:13:34.0639] <hober>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> hmm, crypto + emoji = web 5.0?

 * wouldn't it be web 7.0? maybe i did the math wrong

[09:13:48.0692] <hober>
> <@hober:mozilla.org> wouldn't it be web 7.0? maybe i did the math wrong

hahahah i really did do the math wrong

[09:15:09.0686] <miketayl_r>
lol

[09:15:12.0617] <jgraham>
Right, web 9.0 is when we have an API for executing JS in ring0 (behind a permission prompt)

[09:15:43.0909] <sideshowbarker>
miketayl_r: looking at https://resources.whatwg.org/build/deploy.sh now. I think annevk and Domenic would know something about `EXTRA_FILES` (if anybody does‚Ä¶) 

[09:17:39.0535] <annevk>
Please leave your sense of logic at the door, bring your emoji

[09:18:46.0345] <miketayl_r>
it seems like we can tell the bikeshed API to ignore errors, but that's probably a terrible solution, https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/#curl

[09:19:19.0072] <wanderview>
hello

[09:19:34.0275] <annevk>
miketayl_r: can you file an issue against whatwg/whatwg.org?

[09:19:42.0217] <miketayl_r>
annevk: yeah, np

[09:19:45.0906] <wanderview>
I was somewhat hoping to have this chat and the mozilla chat in the same tab, but I guess they are on separate servers

[09:20:09.0437] <annevk>
It seems like Bikeshed is trying to find the files and maybe we deal with them after running bikeshed or some such

[09:20:23.0259] <annevk>
wanderview: you can keep them in the same tab

[09:20:58.0452] <miketayl_r>
yeah -- you can just add this as a new "channel"

[09:21:03.0135] <miketayl_r>
in ur existing moz setup

[09:21:03.0955] <annevk>
wanderview: in explore rooms you can add other servers to look in

[09:21:24.0290] <jgraham>
(assumign you're using the same account)

[09:21:30.0945] <annevk>
(I'm also working on getting us the whatwg:mozilla.org alias, but it's taking time)

[09:21:39.0300] <jgraham>
 * (assuming you're using the same account, I think)

[09:23:21.0088] <wanderview>
I see, thanks!

[09:23:35.0589] <wanderview>
I had different accounts... but I see I can now message asuth on his mozilla account, etc

[09:24:39.0041] <sideshowbarker>
miketayl_r: `./deploy.sh: line 99: $1: unbound variable` at https://github.com/whatwg/compat/pull/147/checks?check_run_id=2690411902#step:4:25 may or may not related to that later `No such file or directory: '/tmp/stroked-text.png'` error

[09:25:15.0340] <sideshowbarker>
and it is so very great that every time we post that link here, Karl appears

[09:26:27.0312] <sideshowbarker>
as far as I can see, the `deploy.sh` script expects to be called with some argument‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äî and anyway, https://github.com/whatwg/compat/blob/main/Makefile#L24 s not calling it any any argument

[09:27:46.0610] <sideshowbarker>
but the makefiles for other repos don‚Äôt call it with any argument either ‚Äî¬†see https://github.com/whatwg/dom/blob/main/Makefile#L23 ‚Äî so whoknows maybe it‚Äôs not a problem at all

[09:29:30.0720] <miketayl_r>
i just found that if i change `-F die-on=warning` to `F die-on=fatal`, it seems to work as expected

[09:29:34.0670] <wanderview>
will w3c still be using its irc server in the future?  for tpac, etc

[09:29:54.0431] <wanderview>
wondering if I should cancel my irccloud account

[09:30:31.0154] <sideshowbarker>
wanderview: yes w3c will still be using its server for the forseeable future

[09:30:37.0458] <hober>
> <@wanderview:matrix.org> I was somewhat hoping to have this chat and the mozilla chat in the same tab, but I guess they are on separate servers

I have them in the same tab

[09:31:52.0165] <sideshowbarker>
but some of us are hoping to move more channels from w3c irc and over to here ‚Äî e.g., jgraham is for the #testing channel

[09:33:02.0224] <sideshowbarker>
but there is gonna be some inertia against moving WG channels until we have rrsagent and zakim bot equivalents for matrix I guess

[09:33:55.0291] <sideshowbarker>
some groups very much rely on using irc for the meetings, and being able to generate meeting minutes easily with rrsagent, and manage the speaker queue with zakim

[09:37:15.0307] <sideshowbarker>
jgraham: about #testing, I guess you see that you and I both now have ops on the irc channel ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt know what good that does us as far as fixing the **FDNPK0PMG5N0 (IRC) and 246 others** channel name problem that foolip pointed out ‚Äî¬†@kegan:matrix.org seems to be the only person with admin perms to change that

[09:39:01.0937] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
You can link your matrix account to a user in a bridge IRC network, and I believe that should give you permissions to the matrix room

[09:39:02.0979] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-appservice-irc/latest/usage.html#customising-your-experience

[09:39:32.0701] <sideshowbarker>
Andreu Botella (he/they): ah cool ‚Äî will try that

[09:44:04.0405] <annevk>
Yeah, I'm using a bridge for the testing channel. It has a weird room name though.

[09:44:58.0060] <sideshowbarker>
annevk: yeah I think we all have that **FDNPK0PMG5N0 (IRC) and 246 others** weird room name for it showing up

[09:45:37.0460] <sideshowbarker>
PSA: we now have timestamp-linkable logs for this channel at https://matrixlogs.bakkot.com/WHATWG/

[09:45:46.0006] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
Apparently matrix rooms don't _need_ to have a name: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#calculating-the-display-name-for-a-room

[09:46:19.0335] <sideshowbarker>
annevk: may be worth adding https://matrixlogs.bakkot.com/WHATWG/ to the topic

[09:47:15.0625] <sideshowbarker>
> <@andreubotella:mozilla.org> Apparently matrix rooms don't _need_ to have a name: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#calculating-the-display-name-for-a-room

ah yeah  think that‚Äôs the core problem ‚Äî that room somehow doesn‚Äôt have a name, so the clients (or some middle thing) end up computing it

[09:48:20.0558] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> wanderview: yes w3c will still be using its server for the forseeable future

having an official W3C Matrix bridge would be nice, though.

> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> but some of us are hoping to move more channels from w3c irc and over to here ‚Äî e.g., jgraham is for the #testing channel

#testing is kinda a specific case at this point, given it isn't really W3C related at this point. maybe we should just creating a #web-platform-tests:matrix.org for it and be done with it.

[09:54:49.0849] <sideshowbarker>
> <@gsnedders:mozilla.org> #testing is kinda a specific case at this point, given it isn't really W3C related at this point. maybe we should just creating a #web-platform-tests:matrix.org for it and be done with it.

sounds good to me ‚Äî¬†or even just #wpt:matrix.org

[09:57:31.0081] <sideshowbarker>
> <@gsnedders:mozilla.org> having an official W3C Matrix bridge would be nice, though.

about the general topic of w3c moving away from irc, https://github.com/w3c/modern-tooling/issues/16 is the place where that discussion has been taking place already ‚Äî for **6 years now**, since the time when Robin Berjon first opened it

[10:00:43.0498] <sideshowbarker>
I have been meaning to post a comment to that issue to propose that w3c set up its own matrix homeserver, with a list of reasons why that makes a lot more sense now ‚Äî including the fact that w3c peers orgs are on Matrix now: #whatwg:matrix.org and #tc39-general:matrix.org ‚Äî and even IETF, which has its own Matrix server, for #xmpp_hallway_jabber.ietf.org:matrix.organd all

[10:01:15.0388] <sideshowbarker>
the IETF matrix server is just a bridge to their jabber server ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still progress

[12:42:41.0572] <jgraham>
#wpt:matrix.org now exists

[14:44:52.0947] <miketayl_r>
lame, you can't add an emoji reaction to someone joining the room

[14:48:39.0349] <sideshowbarker>
well we need more than just emoji to celebrate karlcow finally showing up

I think running mdn-bcd-collector produces an edit for AbortSignal, so that‚Äôs worth checking out

[00:32:27.0948] <timothygu>
Chromium has a tracking issue for AbortSignal.abort() (https://crbug.com/1187117), but it seems to have stalled. I'm gonna try to pick up the work.

[01:21:11.0173] <sideshowbarker>
> <@foolip:matrix.org> I think running mdn-bcd-collector produces an edit for AbortSignal, so that‚Äôs worth checking out

Ah ok, will take a look

[01:22:01.0021] <foolip>
sideshowbarker: actually I was wrong, just checked

[01:43:11.0563] <jgraham>
So I guess Chromium doesn't really still use IRC (https://www.chromium.org/developers/irc) but does it actually have any widely used public chat system these days?

[01:45:05.0078] <freddy>
I was asking a googler with whom I am collaborating that the externally-facing chat is an invite-only slack and there's an internal-only chat where all the conversations happen. (but maybe there's another externally-facing I don't know)

[02:33:54.0073] <sideshowbarker>
> <@timothygu:matrix.org> It looks like Safari Technical Preview has AbortSignal.abort(). https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223071

Thanks ‚Äî we unfortunately don‚Äôt yet have a way to represent data for Safari Technical Preview in BCD (though I think we will soon). But regardless it‚Äôs great know we do actually have two implementations.

[02:35:25.0486] <foolip>
sideshowbarker: https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10334 should be done soonish, Florian Scholz says that the remaining work is to update the BCD rendering code in yari.

[02:35:49.0128] <foolip>
(To use a different color and show strings like "Nightly" for these entries.)

[02:38:32.0862] <sideshowbarker>
foolip: by the way, once that PR lands, and we get some STP data into BCD, do you still want to also have the `implementation_url` thing I proposed?

[02:39:32.0763] <foolip>
sideshowbarker: I'd still use that occasionally I think, but TBH perhaps more for ancient stuff to show work than for new things which can more easily be tested.

[03:01:20.0335] <Florian Scholz>
Given I hear about "preview" data almost daily now, I'm going to work on it soonish. Promised :)

[03:05:01.0391] <foolip>
No pressure, I'm just very exited üòÄ

[03:05:21.0365] <foolip>
_just a little bit of pressure_

[05:31:03.0559] <zcorpan>
So. WHATWG turns 17 tomorrow

[05:36:50.0818] <Ms2ger>
*What working group* turns 17?

[05:43:35.0232] <foolip>
I guess https://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2004-June/042278.html is the announcement?

[06:19:21.0177] <annevk>
Yeah, also https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1086387609&order=-1&count=1

[06:24:20.0314] <annevk>
I just realized that the majority of my life has now involved WHATWG...

[06:34:13.0972] <foolip>
Oh my. I‚Äôm not quite there yet since I wasn‚Äôt around in the beginning. But it looks like today is my 13th WHATWG birthday. That‚Äôs a thing right? https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2008Jun/0029.html

[06:35:10.0974] <jgraham>
This whole show needs to go on another 5 years or so before it becomes more than half my life. Which is a new way of making me feel old :p

[06:35:43.0537] <foolip>
Let‚Äôs keep the web alive another 5 years to see that happen!

freddy: kind of, for slack if you happen to work for any company listed here, you can join w/o an invite (or your name is in AUTHORS) https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/AUTHORS#1222. 

[08:04:11.0107] <miketayl_r>
(more info @ https://www.chromium.org/developers/slack)

[08:05:10.0108] <miketayl_r>
i would hope the bar is pretty low for getting an invite if you're not on that list, personally

[08:09:29.0276] <jgraham>
miketayl_r: https://www.chromium.org/developers doesn't link to that under "Communications"

[08:09:56.0119] <miketayl_r>
that feels like a bug

[08:10:21.0254] <miketayl_r>
i think i can fix that (when i'm out of this meeting that i'm totally paying attention to)

I joined the Matrix server, this looks kind of like a hybrid between IRC and Discord.
I see not everybody has swapped over yet, as according to the member list.

[21:02:06.0649] <sideshowbarker>
Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]: Was thinking about something last night, and trying to remember: Do I recall correctly that back in the day ‚Äî before Bikeshed and Respec came along, back when the CSS WG was using Bert Bos‚Äôs ‚ÄúCSS preprocessor‚Äù service ‚Äî you were the one who came up with a workalike for that tool/service of Bert‚Äôs. And that was first such tool that we started to use for other  specs. Right?

[21:06:24.0110] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
sideshowbarker: Anolis, yes. Hixie stopped using it for HTML in 2014, so not that long before he stopped editing it, which is around the same time as Bikeshed and Respec were happening IIRC.

[21:06:49.0330] <sideshowbarker>
ah yes, ‚ÄúAnolis‚Äù, of course

[21:07:02.0675] <sideshowbarker>
it was so long ago that I had forgotten the name

[21:07:22.0780] <sideshowbarker>
but that name brings it all back ‚Äî that was great name

[21:08:07.0742] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
I can't quite remember where that came from. I expect some discussion in here?

[21:08:20.0439] <sideshowbarker>
no idea now

[21:08:35.0037] <sideshowbarker>
and I had sorta forgotten that Hixie had been using it for the HTML spec ‚Äî but I guess he must have used it for years

[21:09:01.0252] <sideshowbarker>
like, at least 5 years, he was using it to generate the published HTML spec

[21:10:19.0006] <sideshowbarker>
I am disappointed in myself for forgetting ‚Äî that was a pretty key tool for all those years

[21:11:15.0972] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
I think I wrote it partly to have tools that didn't rely on having access to the W3C CSS WG servers, and partly because Hixie was annoyed at how long they were taking as the HTML spec got ever bigger!

[21:12:02.0042] <sideshowbarker>
yeah the code for Bert‚Äôs thing was actually all bash/sed/etc

[21:12:26.0864] <sideshowbarker>
It was good that it was only exposed as a web service ‚Äî people would have been baffled by that code

[21:13:34.0431] <sideshowbarker>
I mean, I liked that code myself, but I think you had to be from a certain earlier era to not find it a giant WTF

[21:14:58.0525] <sideshowbarker>
anyway, Anolis was a nice piece of work

[21:16:18.0848] <sideshowbarker>
I now don‚Äôt recall why we didn‚Äôt start using it for specs other than HTML ‚Äî why Bikeshed became necessary ‚Äî but I vaguely recall that being because Anolis ended up being pretty tightly coupled to the quirks for the source of the HTML spec

[21:16:52.0154] <sideshowbarker>
not easily generalizable/portable to use for other specs, maybe?

[21:17:33.0235] <GPHemsley>
we totally used Anolis for other specs

[21:17:38.0520] <GPHemsley>
mimesniff started in anolis

[21:17:42.0746] <sideshowbarker>
ah OK

[21:18:23.0344] <sideshowbarker>
I seem to have pushed all knowledge of this stuff way into the back of my memory

[21:18:31.0678] <sideshowbarker>
tape storage

[21:18:57.0336] <GPHemsley>
looks like the conversion, at least for mimesniff, happened in 2016

[21:19:18.0314] <sideshowbarker>
OK

[21:19:24.0219] <GPHemsley>
I assume we switched to bikeshed because it supported more things

[21:19:32.0612] <GPHemsley>
(I wasn't involved in the conversion)

[21:20:47.0815] <sideshowbarker>
hmm among my other vague recollections is that Sam got tired of maintaining Anolis and didn‚Äôt like fixing bugs in it any more, something like that

[21:21:10.0997] <GPHemsley>
could be

[21:21:18.0012] <GPHemsley>
and Tab was busy doing stuff for CSS

[21:21:27.0086] <GPHemsley>
so it was already there

[21:21:48.0150] <sideshowbarker>
yeah, something like that

[21:25:04.0769] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
Bikeshed quickly got features that Anolis didn't have, and I had long ago stopped really maintaining it (Ms2ger maintained it for a while).

[21:25:40.0106] <GPHemsley>
oh yes, Ms2ger was maintainer when I was editing, I think

[21:25:48.0994] <GPHemsley>
looks like encoding started in anolis too

[21:27:58.0210] <GPHemsley>
probably others, but I'll stop digging

[21:28:26.0750] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
Plenty of others; virtually everything written between 2008 and 2013 or so used it.

[21:29:10.0408] <GPHemsley>
right

[21:32:15.0894] <GPHemsley>
oh wow, turns out I submitted quite a few PRs to anolis

[21:33:31.0989] <karlcow>
was it partly https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/

[21:33:39.0367] <karlcow>
