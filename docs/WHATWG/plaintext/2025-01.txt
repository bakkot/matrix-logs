https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#:~:text=Returns%20the%20event%E2%80%99s%20timestamp%20as,relative%20to%20the%20occurrence.%20

"Returns the event‚Äôs timestamp as the number of milliseconds measured relative to the occurrence."

Is this incorrect as worded? The timestamp is relative to the Unix epoch. "Occurrence" sounds like it's the event occurrence.

[01:44:56.0219] <Noam Rosenthal>
It's not relative to the epoch, it's monotonic time, initialized in https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#inner-event-creation-steps #w3c:matrix.org

[01:45:48.0356] <Noam Rosenthal>
I agree that the non-normative description for `timeStamp` can be worded better

Happy New Year, WHATWG!
I would appreciate some feedback on https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1601 (and not just from Anne). üôè

Hi everyone, I wonder what are the accessibility concerns that are solved by making _non-modal_ [HTML] `dialog` elements themselves focusable? I am playing with one here on Firefox 133, and a focused `dialog` shown with the `show` method, focused through keyboard navigation, seems to offer absolutely nothing in terms of being focused. To explain, I have a form that is part of the dialog, with `method="dialog"` so that the [submit] buttons in the form close the  dialog, and the first button is focused initially when the dialog is shown, as expected, and I have zero issues with that. It's when I "tab" myself backwards and the focus switches to the dialog element itself, that got me thinking -- what is the use for that, and shouldn't I, in this case, add a `tabindex="-1"` to the dialog element?

> <@akaster:serenityos.org> Is there a meaningful difference between an `optional any` argument being _missing_ vs being the value `undefined`? https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/1861

I explained how the spec matches the test in the issue

If an HTML document is served with a `Content-Type: text/html` without a `charset` parameter, but with `<meta charset="shift_jis">`, then the spec requirements are that UAs must respect the `<meta charset="shift_jis">` ‚Äî and use `shift_jis` as the character encoding, right?

[00:58:45.0380] <sideshowbarker>
I‚Äôm specifically looking at https://www.ntt-west.co.jp/news/1504/150417a.html

A BOM can override all technically, but that website does not appear to have one.

[01:19:51.0000] <sideshowbarker>
OK, the https://webirc.w3.org/ client (which is an instance of https://thelounge.chat)¬†seems to not handle the encoding properly¬†‚Äî¬†even regardless of whether it‚Äôs set in the Content-Type header

[01:20:32.0758] <sideshowbarker>
That client does previews of any link you post¬†‚Äî¬†just as Matrix does here

[01:21:37.0694] <sideshowbarker>
https://www.w3.org/2025/tests/shift_jis-encoding.html is a demo of the same document, but with a proper `Content-Type:¬†text/html; charset=shift_jis` HTTP header. But in TheLounge, the preview for it is mojibake

[01:23:29.0577] <sideshowbarker>
Anyway, maybe I‚Äôll try to write a patch for it. That Lounge is otherwise a really great client. Among other things, it enables you to stay on an IRC channel persistently ‚Äî¬†even after you close the browser tab, or close the browser. Like IRCCloud or whatever

Can you please tell me how I can test this step from the specification of the [create and initialize a Document object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#initialise-the-document-object) algorithm?

> If browsingContext's active document's is initial about:blank is true, and browsingContext's active document's origin is same origin-domain with navigationParams's origin, then set window to browsingContext's active window.

Interesting. Are there any other examples besides executing javascript in the search bar?

* Interesting. Are there any other examples besides executing javascript in the URL?

[07:00:02.0000] <zcorpan>
I think javascript: url is the only case where the document is swapped. But you could detect it in other ways, e.g. OAC

[07:06:18.0569] <Maxim Vaarwel>
I tried iframes, storing different properties in the window object. But I could not find a single case where the window object matches when loading a new document, as in your case.

What does OAC mean?
