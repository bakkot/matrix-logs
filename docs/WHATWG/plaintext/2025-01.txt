https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#:~:text=Returns%20the%20event%E2%80%99s%20timestamp%20as,relative%20to%20the%20occurrence.%20

"Returns the event’s timestamp as the number of milliseconds measured relative to the occurrence."

Is this incorrect as worded? The timestamp is relative to the Unix epoch. "Occurrence" sounds like it's the event occurrence.

It's not relative to the epoch, it's monotonic time, initialized in https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#inner-event-creation-steps #w3c:matrix.org

I agree that the non-normative description for `timeStamp` can be worded better

Happy New Year, WHATWG!
I would appreciate some feedback on https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1601 (and not just from Anne). 🙏

Hi everyone, I wonder what are the accessibility concerns that are solved by making _non-modal_ [HTML] `dialog` elements themselves focusable? I am playing with one here on Firefox 133, and a focused `dialog` shown with the `show` method, focused through keyboard navigation, seems to offer absolutely nothing in terms of being focused. To explain, I have a form that is part of the dialog, with `method="dialog"` so that the [submit] buttons in the form close the  dialog, and the first button is focused initially when the dialog is shown, as expected, and I have zero issues with that. It's when I "tab" myself backwards and the focus switches to the dialog element itself, that got me thinking -- what is the use for that, and shouldn't I, in this case, add a `tabindex="-1"` to the dialog element?

Happy new year everyone! I opened a PR to node.js to add URLPattern https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/56452

> <@akaster:serenityos.org> Is there a meaningful difference between an `optional any` argument being _missing_ vs being the value `undefined`? https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/1861

I explained how the spec matches the test in the issue

If an HTML document is served with a `Content-Type: text/html` without a `charset` parameter, but with `<meta charset="shift_jis">`, then the spec requirements are that UAs must respect the `<meta charset="shift_jis">` — and use `shift_jis` as the character encoding, right?

[00:58:45.0380] <sideshowbarker>
I’m specifically looking at https://www.ntt-west.co.jp/news/1504/150417a.html

sideshowbarker: yup.

A BOM can override all technically, but that website does not appear to have one.

[01:19:51.0000] <sideshowbarker>
OK, the https://webirc.w3.org/ client (which is an instance of https://thelounge.chat) seems to not handle the encoding properly — even regardless of whether it’s set in the Content-Type header

[01:20:32.0758] <sideshowbarker>
That client does previews of any link you post — just as Matrix does here

[01:21:37.0694] <sideshowbarker>
https://www.w3.org/2025/tests/shift_jis-encoding.html is a demo of the same document, but with a proper `Content-Type: text/html; charset=shift_jis` HTTP header. But in TheLounge, the preview for it is mojibake

[01:23:29.0577] <sideshowbarker>
Anyway, maybe I’ll try to write a patch for it. That Lounge is otherwise a really great client. Among other things, it enables you to stay on an IRC channel persistently — even after you close the browser tab, or close the browser. Like IRCCloud or whatever

Good Day  to all. I am new to coding as well as this community.
