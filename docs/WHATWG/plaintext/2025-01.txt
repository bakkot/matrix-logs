https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#:~:text=Returns%20the%20event%E2%80%99s%20timestamp%20as,relative%20to%20the%20occurrence.%20

"Returns the event‚Äôs timestamp as the number of milliseconds measured relative to the occurrence."

Is this incorrect as worded? The timestamp is relative to the Unix epoch. "Occurrence" sounds like it's the event occurrence.

It's not relative to the epoch, it's monotonic time, initialized in https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#inner-event-creation-steps #w3c:matrix.org

I agree that the non-normative description for `timeStamp` can be worded better

Happy New Year, WHATWG!
I would appreciate some feedback on https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1601 (and not just from Anne). üôè

Hi everyone, I wonder what are the accessibility concerns that are solved by making _non-modal_ [HTML] `dialog` elements themselves focusable? I am playing with one here on Firefox 133, and a focused `dialog` shown with the `show` method, focused through keyboard navigation, seems to offer absolutely nothing in terms of being focused. To explain, I have a form that is part of the dialog, with `method="dialog"` so that the [submit] buttons in the form close the  dialog, and the first button is focused initially when the dialog is shown, as expected, and I have zero issues with that. It's when I "tab" myself backwards and the focus switches to the dialog element itself, that got me thinking -- what is the use for that, and shouldn't I, in this case, add a `tabindex="-1"` to the dialog element?
