https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#:~:text=Returns%20the%20event%E2%80%99s%20timestamp%20as,relative%20to%20the%20occurrence.%20

"Returns the event‚Äôs timestamp as the number of milliseconds measured relative to the occurrence."

Is this incorrect as worded? The timestamp is relative to the Unix epoch. "Occurrence" sounds like it's the event occurrence.

[01:44:56.0219] <Noam Rosenthal>
It's not relative to the epoch, it's monotonic time, initialized in https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#inner-event-creation-steps #w3c:matrix.org

[01:45:48.0356] <Noam Rosenthal>
I agree that the non-normative description for `timeStamp` can be worded better

Happy New Year, WHATWG!
I would appreciate some feedback on https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1601 (and not just from Anne). üôè

[10:16:43.0823] <judge_sour_dough_bread>
Hi everyone, I wonder what are the accessibility concerns that are solved by making _non-modal_ [HTML] `dialog` elements themselves focusable? I am playing with one here on Firefox 133, and a focused `dialog` shown with the `show` method, focused through keyboard navigation, seems to offer absolutely nothing in terms of being focused. To explain, I have a form that is part of the dialog, with `method="dialog"` so that the [submit] buttons in the form close the  dialog, and the first button is focused initially when the dialog is shown, as expected, and I have zero issues with that. It's when I "tab" myself backwards and the focus switches to the dialog element itself, that got me thinking -- what is the use for that, and shouldn't I, in this case, add a `tabindex="-1"` to the dialog element?

If an HTML document is served with a `Content-Type: text/html` without a `charset` parameter, but with `<meta charset="shift_jis">`, then the spec requirements are that UAs must respect the `<meta charset="shift_jis">` ‚Äî and use `shift_jis` as the character encoding, right?

[00:58:45.0380] <sideshowbarker>

A BOM can override all technically, but that website does not appear to have one.

[01:19:51.0000] <sideshowbarker>
OK, the https://webirc.w3.org/ client (which is an instance of https://thelounge.chat)¬†seems to not handle the encoding properly¬†‚Äî¬†even regardless of whether it‚Äôs set in the Content-Type header

[01:20:32.0758] <sideshowbarker>
That client does previews of any link you post¬†‚Äî¬†just as Matrix does here

[01:21:37.0694] <sideshowbarker>
https://www.w3.org/2025/tests/shift_jis-encoding.html is a demo of the same document, but with a proper `Content-Type:¬†text/html; charset=shift_jis` HTTP header. But in TheLounge, the preview for it is mojibake

[01:23:29.0577] <sideshowbarker>
Anyway, maybe I‚Äôll try to write a patch for it. That Lounge is otherwise a really great client. Among other things, it enables you to stay on an IRC channel persistently ‚Äî¬†even after you close the browser tab, or close the browser. Like IRCCloud or whatever

Can you please tell me how I can test this step from the specification of the [create and initialize a Document object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#initialise-the-document-object) algorithm?

> If browsingContext's active document's is initial about:blank is true, and browsingContext's active document's origin is same origin-domain with navigationParams's origin, then set window to browsingContext's active window.

* Interesting. Are there any other examples besides executing javascript in the URL?

[07:00:02.0000] <zcorpan>
I think javascript: url is the only case where the document is swapped. But you could detect it in other ways, e.g. OAC

[07:06:18.0569] <Maxim Vaarwel>
I tried iframes, storing different properties in the window object. But I could not find a single case where the window object matches when loading a new document, as in your case.

What does OAC mean?

[01:40:56.0973] <Domenic>
There are ways to test that without JS URLs. The 2-documents 1-Window horribleness is much more broad-reaching than that, I think... let me find some old threads...

[01:42:35.0113] <Domenic>
Ah it's coming back to me, this can be tested by using global variables and watching them stick around...

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/browsers/the-window-object/window-reuse-in-nested-browsing-contexts.tentative.html

and the tests in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/804797

[01:48:58.0995] <Domenic>
I seem to remember needing to use global `var` declarations for something related to this, to test `Window` vs. `WindowProxy`, but those tests above don't seem to be bothering with that.

[04:18:20.0765] <Maxim Vaarwel>
Yeah, I've seen some of those links. But I haven't looked at wpt tests before your post. I ran tests on chrome and firefox. Chrome fails almost everything, but firefox isn't perfect either, although it passes almost all the tests.

Thanks for the links and help.

zcorpan: (or anybody else set up to do HTTP Archive queries) Can you do query to find out how many pages have `shift_jis` (lowercase) in the `<meta charset>` or `<meta http-equiv content>` values? Or in the `Content-Type` header?


2025-01-13
[16:13:53.0054] <sideshowbarker>
zcorpan: Or actually, not just lowercase but case-insensitive for the standard `Shift_JIS` ‚Äî also (case-insensitive) `shift-jis`

[16:14:01.0765] <sideshowbarker>
Context is https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4951#discussion_r1912529404

[01:33:43.0427] <Noam Rosenthal>
Do you have a REGEXP handy? I checked "<meta[^>]+(charset|content)=\"shift[_-]jis\"" on response bodies in November, got 1333 out of 672M

[02:59:35.0159] <sideshowbarker>
That regexp looks right

[03:01:41.0640] <sideshowbarker>
I guess the lowercase shift_jis is relatively rare. Maybe a Shift_JIS query would return a lot more hits

[03:32:15.0167] <Noam Rosenthal>
`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `httparchive.response_bodies.2024_11_01_desktop` WHERE REGEXP_CONTAINS(response_body, "<meta[^>]+(charset|content)=\"SHIFT[_-]JIS\"")`
returned 32

[04:34:01.0258] <sideshowbarker>
Thanks ‚Äî¬†how about just `Shift_JIS` (that is, `Shift` rather than `SHIFT`)

[05:09:07.0329] <Noam Rosenthal>
With ignore-case it's 3769

[05:09:22.0415] <sideshowbarker>
Thanks much!

Hmm, what is the odd white box (when using dark mode) in the warning here: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#interaction-with-details-and-hidden=until-found 

[06:23:40.0869] <Luke Warlow>
It's an image of a fingerprint as a link to somewhere. Bit odd it covers content though. Probably needs a darkmode-aware class adding to the img.

[06:56:41.0814] <zcorpan>
Origin-Agent-Cluster. See the "otherwise" steps in the spec

[19:00:55.0145] <Kaiido>
Oh, I thought https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi/pull/161 would fix this...

[19:39:18.0945] <sideshowbarker>
not also fixed in bikeshed yet, maybe?

[20:22:25.0747] <Kaiido>
Yes, TabAtkins fixed it for bikeshed in https://github.com/speced/bikeshed/commit/72e42de7d16654bc6059cf0d622d14d4035fe536

[21:40:51.0253] <Domenic>
Maybe HTML's stylesheet doesn't do the darkmode-aware thing? Although I thought that part was shared between HTML and Bikeshed specs.

[22:10:31.0839] <TabAtkins>
The fix there is in the markup of the image itself, html is using its own file.

[01:55:24.0739] <zcorpan>
HTML uses https://resources.whatwg.org/tracking-vector.svg which responds to dark mode. But the `img` needs `class=darkmode-aware`

[01:59:02.0898] <zcorpan>
But now I'm confused why it doesn't - https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi/blob/main/src/wattsi.pas#L1695

[02:48:18.0422] <Noam Rosenthal>
zcorpan: I was thinking about the async-CSS discussion... `font-display: swap` is a valid use case (though I personally really dislike that UX)
I thought of an option to add `<link rel="font stylesheet">`, where `rel=font` would be non-blocking, but only allow font-descriptors

[02:49:56.0552] <zcorpan>
Noam Rosenthal: I assume people use the onload hack for more than fonts

[02:52:35.0323] <Noam Rosenthal>
zcorpan: for that, I thought to have `<link rel=stylesheet for=some-id>` where the stylesheet would load, but would only apply when we see an element with that ID

[02:53:11.0397] <Noam Rosenthal>
zcorpan: I kind of see these as separate use-cases, where in one of them you actively opt-in to an FOUT and in the other one you probably don't want it but you don't know when the element will come

[02:53:20.0889] <Noam Rosenthal>
* zcorpan: I kind of see these as separate use-cases, where in one of them you actively opt-in to a FOUT and in the other one you probably don't want it but you don't know when the element will come

[02:54:13.0884] <Noam Rosenthal>
If we had a general `async` people would use it for "below the fold" and then they'd have a FoUCy race between scrolling and CSS loading
