"Returns the eventâ€™s timestamp as the number of milliseconds measured relative to the occurrence."

Is this incorrect as worded? The timestamp is relative to the Unix epoch. "Occurrence" sounds like it's the event occurrence.

It's not relative to the epoch, it's monotonic time, initialized in https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#inner-event-creation-steps #w3c:matrix.org
