Hello, all.
I just noticed a small typo in a section's id in the DOM specs and am not sure what's the best action (since this is used as link, maybe in many places). The section is https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#action-versus-occurance I guess fixing it is not worth the trouble of potentially breaking existing links? (The readable text is fine)

Howdy Kaiido: itâ€™s possible to add a new ID while preserving the existing ID

Usually ID's are autogenerated from the heading text, at least in Bikeshed, and if this one isn't, it might be because the typo was fixed in the heading but the ID had to stay the same to avoid breaking links

that particular ID is hardcoded in the source, for some reason

I also see British "initialisation" in the ID with American "initialization" in the dfn text sometimes

you see that in any WHATWG specs?

Yes I would also have thought https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#action-versus-occurence would be working but it doesn't.
