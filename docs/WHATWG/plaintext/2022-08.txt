hallo  every body

[00:14:51.0336] <Kaiido>
Hello, all.
I just noticed a small typo in a section's id in the DOM specs and am not sure what's the best action (since this is used as link, maybe in many places). The section is https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#action-versus-occurance I guess fixing it is not worth the trouble of potentially breaking existing links? (The readable text is fine)

[00:16:31.0818] <sideshowbarker>
Howdy Kaiido: it‚Äôs possible to add a new ID while preserving the existing ID

[00:17:38.0519] <Andreu Botella>
Usually ID's are autogenerated from the heading text, at least in Bikeshed, and if this one isn't, it might be because the typo was fixed in the heading but the ID had to stay the same to avoid breaking links

[00:17:51.0798] <Andreu Botella>
 * Usually ID's are autogenerated from the heading text, at least in Bikeshed, and if this one isn't, it might be because the typo was fixed in the heading but the ID had to stay the same to avoid breaking links

[00:18:13.0349] <sideshowbarker>
that particular ID is hardcoded in the source, for some reason

[00:18:25.0821] <Andreu Botella>
I also see British "initialisation" in the ID with American "initialization" in the dfn text sometimes

[00:19:19.0612] <sideshowbarker>
> <@abotella:igalia.com> I also see British "initialisation" in the ID with American "initialization" in the dfn text sometimes

you see that in any WHATWG specs?

[00:19:34.0019] <Kaiido>
Yes I would also have thought https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#action-versus-occurence would be working but it doesn't.

[00:20:09.0239] <sideshowbarker>
yeah that‚Äôs because of it being hardcoded ‚Äî that overrides the Bikeshed auto-generation

[00:20:47.0798] <sideshowbarker>
but the existing `id=action-versus-occurance` could be moved to a `span` child of that `h3`

[00:21:17.0830] <sideshowbarker>
‚Ä¶and then the Bikeshed auto-generation of the ID on the `h3` will work as expected, and the existing ID will work too

[00:21:25.0334] <Andreu Botella>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> you see that in any WHATWG specs?

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/timers-and-user-prompts.html#timer-initialisation-steps

[00:21:29.0242] <sideshowbarker>
‚Ä¶I think

[00:21:40.0338] <sideshowbarker>
pretty sure I have actually done that before, in some cases

[00:22:54.0457] <sideshowbarker>
> <@abotella:igalia.com> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/timers-and-user-prompts.html#timer-initialisation-steps

ah‚Ä¶ I blame Hixie :) that must have been in there for a long time

[00:24:48.0805] <sideshowbarker>
https://ian.hixie.ch/bible/english

[00:26:11.0084] <sideshowbarker>
but I think Hixie always had the spec as `lang=en-US-hixie` so that _‚Äúinitialisation‚Äù_ would have always been a bug anyway

[04:21:13.0628] <Jake Archibald>
When adding spec data to JS objects, I've seen some people use internal slots, whereas others just say "SomeObject has a <dfn for="SomeObject">thing</dfn>". Is there a 'right' way?

[04:21:38.0558] <Jake Archibald>
I usually just do the latter

[05:24:32.0495] <Jake Archibald>
Also, if a callback is put in an internal slot, does it impact the `this` value in the callback when it's called?

[05:44:46.0926] <Domenic>
I prefer the latter, and am somewhat responsible for introducing the former

[05:45:34.0070] <Domenic>
Is a callback a Web IDL callback, or an algorithm? Web IDL callbacks need to be called with specific thisArgs via https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#invoke-a-callback-function

[07:42:37.0177] <Jake Archibald>
It's a WebIDL callback. Ok, I'll move the shared element transition spec away from internal slots

[07:42:41.0671] <Jake Archibald>
ts!

[08:30:34.0210] <Jake Archibald>

does anyone know who officially speaks for Mozilla on decisions like https://github.com/WICG/uuid/issues/23 now? I would like to revisit it given the most recent comment in that thread but I understand annevk left.

Depending on timing I might be able to join, or I can ask around.

[06:52:04.0909] <Jake Archibald>
emilio: we'll look to time it so you can join üòÄ

[06:53:33.0907] <emilio>
Jake Archibald: Are you looking for feedback in some area in particular? Just in case I need to check with the graphics folks and so on :)

[06:58:34.0802] <Jake Archibald>
emilio: I want to make sure the feature isn't designed "for Chromium". As in, are there changes that could be made to make it easier to implement in Gecko (without compromising developer experience)? Are there parts of the design that you feel currently compromise developer experience due to an implementation detail unique to Chromium. But also I'd just like a general review of the feature from someone familiar with the platform.

I think I've asked this before, but when do we use `abort these steps` vs `return`? I tend to use `abort these steps` where returning a value wouldn't make sense, eg in a queued task, or in parallel. Is that‚Ä¶ right?

[05:59:41.0975] <Domenic>
That's right!

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73254813/javascript-using-fetch-api-to-send-same-origin-get-request-with-non-null-origin

I think the answer is No, there‚Äôs no way to cause an Origin header to be added to a same-origin GET request. Right?


2022-08-07
[06:02:39.0377] <Noam Rosenthal>
Right, it's a forbidden header, so it's ignored from the Headers JS constructor https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-header-name

[02:24:11.0753] <Jake Archibald>
 * sideshowbarker: `Origin` will be added to same-origin CORS requests - no, I'm wrong

[02:28:06.0450] <Jake Archibald>
Same-origin CORS requests have their response tainting set to "`basic`", so they don't get an origin header

[02:30:50.0087] <evilpie>
For non-GET requests we do need to set the header though, the current spec is not web compatible https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1022

Not off the top of my head

[05:05:07.0147] <sideshowbarker>
Yeah I took a quick look at the Gecko sources in the hope it might be easy to see what conditions would lead to that error message being emitted, but that quick look was enough to see that a much longer look would be needed to figure it out..

[06:04:12.0699] <Noam Rosenthal>

bakkot: Does your Matrix logger work by way of a bot on the channel that parses incoming messages?
Or does it instead parse the https://view.matrix.org/ logs/format?

[18:57:22.0887] <Maxim Vaarwel>
Could anyone explain me what kind of difference between top-level browsing context and auxiliary browsing context?

[19:46:16.0730] <Domenic>
Maxim Vaarwel: An auxiliary BC is a type of top-level BC. In particular it's one that was created via window.open() or target="_blank" or similar, i.e. there is an opener/openee relationship.

[20:16:00.0162] <bakkot>
sideshowbarker: it hits the "get messages" API, which does not require the bot to be in the channel

[20:17:10.0516] <bakkot>
(I should say, does not require the bot to be in the channel as long as the room history is set to be viewable to everyone, not just joined members.)

Hello ! I have a question

[04:22:00.0734] <Omar Sehlouli>
I set up flask_cors on the server side, but still when I set up my extension to send POST request, this occurs


[04:26:05.0619] <Omar Sehlouli>
I have provided some additional images, I'm stuck at this for like a day, and I can't figure out why 

[04:58:25.0111] <Luca Casonato>
Your options request should return an 200 OK status, not a 401

[05:00:45.0733] <Luca Casonato>
CORS preflight (OPTIONS) requests must return a 200 or 204 status code to be considered successful

[06:05:43.0908] <Omar Sehlouli>
Yeah, but how can I resolve the issue? it returns 401, because it needs an authorization header 

[06:06:53.0866] <Omar Sehlouli>
the preflight sends a request to see if they accept authorization as a header first with method : POST , before sending the actual POST request. Please correct me if I'm wrong but that's what I have understood

[06:14:44.0787] <Luca Casonato>
You should not perform access control handling on the options request. The response to the options request should just indicate if the server is willing to process the real request at all, not if the real request will succeed or fail

[06:15:21.0151] <Omar Sehlouli>
I have handled it, thanks to your answer. I have reread your answer and understood what I should do

[06:15:44.0398] <Omar Sehlouli>
I have added an ( if not request.method == 'OPTIONS' ) and it worked

[06:16:23.0904] <Omar Sehlouli>
Thank you again!

[08:43:38.0008] <smaug>
MikeSmith: didn't you have a page listing all the specs?

[08:46:14.0720] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>

[08:47:02.0419] <Ms2ger üíâüíâ>
smaug: ^

[08:47:55.0040] <smaug>

[02:23:53.0142] <sideshowbarker>
> <@smaug:mozilla.org> I was just looking at some helper page for someone not so familiar with various specs.

https://w3c.github.io/mdn-spec-links/ is the closest thing I have this point ‚Äî as far as what‚Äôs up-to-date and actively maintained

‚Ä¶however that page doesn‚Äôt currently/yet have links to the specs themselves ‚Äî¬†but I can add that

Unlike https://platform.html5.org/ it doesn‚Äôt organize the specs into any category groupings ‚Äî and I really have no plans to ever make it do that.

But the nature of it is, it represents the set of specs that we actually have some documentation for in MDN. So it‚Äôs fairly complete as far as representing what specs constitute the feature set for the web platform.

[02:25:18.0606] <smaug>
I was indeed looking for some page which has links to the specs

[02:25:59.0757] <sideshowbarker>
well I can add links to that page, if you think the page with those links added would be useful for what you had in mind

[02:30:16.0004] <smaug>
sideshowbarker: or would it be possible to get https://platform.html5.org/ back üôÇ 

[02:30:47.0402] <smaug>
I think that is the page which had rather nice simple UI

[02:30:58.0640] <sideshowbarker>
https://platform.html5.org/ is working for me

[02:31:13.0282] <sideshowbarker>
it just has not been updated in literally years

[02:32:06.0622] <smaug>
Not loading here.

[02:33:43.0358] <sideshowbarker>
ah yeah I guess it was loading from cache for me

[02:36:25.0503] <sideshowbarker>
OK, some Dreamhost issue. I forget now how we have that set up but I think the DNS is through Dreamhost with a CNAME or whatever, and the actual content is served from where all the whatwg.org content is served from

[02:38:10.0964] <smaug>
The idea is roughly to show some part of the problem space for someone who is coming outside the web platform world. Having a list of specs may give a relatively good hint how vastly different APIs and features we're dealing with.

[02:38:23.0157] <sideshowbarker>
OK

[02:43:24.0277] <sideshowbarker>
it will take me a while to figure out why https://platform.html5.org/ isn‚Äôt responding ‚Äî but in the meantime I can at least get the spec URLs added to https://w3c.github.io/mdn-spec-links/

that I think I can do right now

[03:24:08.0785] <sideshowbarker>
smaug: https://w3c.github.io/mdn-spec-links/ now has all the spec URLs

That‚Äôs the best I can do for now.

Eventually I may be able to replicate https://platform.html5.org/ by writing something that creates an alternative view with them grouped into categories. But that will take quite a lot more time than just adding the spec URLs did.

Anyway, it seems like this list does meet the needs of giving a hint about the vastly different APIs and features we're dealing with. It‚Äôs close to 300 specs now‚Ä¶

[03:24:42.0912] <smaug>
that is good, thanks

[03:31:33.0742] <sideshowbarker>
hmm I just thought of one other piece of data I could add that might be useful: I can add a number indicating the how many times MDN articles reference each spec.

So, for example, it‚Äôll show that the Accelerometer spec is referenced by 10 MDN articles whereas the HTML spec is referenced by 1087

[03:45:04.0246] <sideshowbarker>
OK https://w3c.github.io/mdn-spec-links/ now shows the MDN-article counts

That seems useful for getting a quick sense of the relative importance of each spec.

[03:46:54.0431] <sideshowbarker>
‚Ä¶though it‚Äôs a bit surprising to see that WebXR has 109 MDN articles ‚Äî and even more surprising to see that WebCodecs has 100 MDN articles‚Ä¶

[03:48:30.0284] <sideshowbarker>
lord, I wonder who wrote all those WebCodecs articles‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs pretty epic

[03:49:19.0010] <sideshowbarker>
none of that implemented outside of Blink yet, I don‚Äôt think

[03:53:48.0131] <sideshowbarker>
well, I guess that‚Äôs an indication that using the count of MDN articles to evaluate the relative importance of a particular spec needs to be tempered by an understanding that part of the way things get into MDN based is based on organizations funding somebody to write up the articles (which can be based on that organization‚Äôs particular priorities and not necessarily on how important the feature is to the platform‚Ä¶)

hey folks, question about the workers spec

[04:04:45.0438] <yulia>
in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#worker-processing-model we have the following line in step 14: 

`In both cases, to perform the fetch given request, perform the following steps if the is top-level flag is set:`

[04:05:02.0625] <yulia>
for the definition of is top-level we have the following https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#fetching-scripts-is-top-level

[04:05:29.0689] <yulia>
reading through this, it seems like `is top-level` only applies to modules, but not to classic scripts imported via `importScripts`. Is that correct or am i missing something here?

[04:05:54.0407] <yulia>
In other words, for an importScript, we should run the steps in instruction 14, as the `is top-level` bit will not be set

[04:06:28.0789] <yulia>
 * In other words, for an importScript, we should run the steps in instruction 14, as the `is top-level` bit will not be set

[04:07:05.0143] <yulia>
but, the only excluded form of loading that is explicitly called out is dynamic import

[04:10:50.0373] <yulia>
probably a question for Domenic or possible annevk ?

[04:14:38.0143] <yulia>
 * but, the only excluded form of loading that is explicitly called out is dynamic import. In addition, the steps in 14 are doing various initialization steps on the worker global. I wouldn't expect those to be repeated when we import something into the global.

I wouldn't expect those to be repeated when we import something into the global. It also looks like those are really meant to be initialized with the agent cluster based on the note.
