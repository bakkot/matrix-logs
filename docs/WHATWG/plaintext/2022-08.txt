hallo  every body

Hello, all.
I just noticed a small typo in a section's id in the DOM specs and am not sure what's the best action (since this is used as link, maybe in many places). The section is https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#action-versus-occurance I guess fixing it is not worth the trouble of potentially breaking existing links? (The readable text is fine)

[00:16:31.0818] <sideshowbarker>
Howdy Kaiido: it’s possible to add a new ID while preserving the existing ID

[00:17:38.0519] <Andreu Botella>
Usually ID's are autogenerated from the heading text, at least in Bikeshed, and if this one isn't, it might be because the typo was fixed in the heading but the ID had to stay the same to avoid breaking links

[00:18:13.0349] <sideshowbarker>
that particular ID is hardcoded in the source, for some reason

[00:18:25.0821] <Andreu Botella>
I also see British "initialisation" in the ID with American "initialization" in the dfn text sometimes

you see that in any WHATWG specs?

[00:19:34.0019] <Kaiido>
Yes I would also have thought https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#action-versus-occurence would be working but it doesn't.

[00:20:09.0239] <sideshowbarker>
yeah that’s because of it being hardcoded — that overrides the Bikeshed auto-generation

[00:20:47.0798] <sideshowbarker>
but the existing `id=action-versus-occurance` could be moved to a `span` child of that `h3`

[00:21:17.0830] <sideshowbarker>
…and then the Bikeshed auto-generation of the ID on the `h3` will work as expected, and the existing ID will work too

[00:21:25.0334] <Andreu Botella>

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/timers-and-user-prompts.html#timer-initialisation-steps

[00:21:29.0242] <sideshowbarker>
…I think

[00:21:40.0338] <sideshowbarker>
pretty sure I have actually done that before, in some cases

ah… I blame Hixie :) that must have been in there for a long time

[00:24:48.0805] <sideshowbarker>
https://ian.hixie.ch/bible/english

[00:26:11.0084] <sideshowbarker>
but I think Hixie always had the spec as `lang=en-US-hixie` so that _“initialisation”_ would have always been a bug anyway

[04:21:13.0628] <Jake Archibald>
When adding spec data to JS objects, I've seen some people use internal slots, whereas others just say "SomeObject has a <dfn for="SomeObject">thing</dfn>". Is there a 'right' way?

[04:21:38.0558] <Jake Archibald>
I usually just do the latter

[05:24:32.0495] <Jake Archibald>
Also, if a callback is put in an internal slot, does it impact the `this` value in the callback when it's called?

[05:44:46.0926] <Domenic>
I prefer the latter, and am somewhat responsible for introducing the former

[05:45:34.0070] <Domenic>
Is a callback a Web IDL callback, or an algorithm? Web IDL callbacks need to be called with specific thisArgs via https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#invoke-a-callback-function

[07:42:37.0177] <Jake Archibald>
It's a WebIDL callback. Ok, I'll move the shared element transition spec away from internal slots

ts!
