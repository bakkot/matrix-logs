Hello, all.
I just noticed a small typo in a section's id in the DOM specs and am not sure what's the best action (since this is used as link, maybe in many places). The section is https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#action-versus-occurance I guess fixing it is not worth the trouble of potentially breaking existing links? (The readable text is fine)
