i wish there was one thing. favicons optional and not required, not asked by browsers unless site said so via manifest or <link>. i really wish… (specially as a person testing on localhost in folders and subfolders…)

Hmm, I don't think https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#await-a-stable-state works. Queuing microtasks from outside the main event loop doesn't make sense, and as far as I see, that 'await a stable state' may hang forever, since nothing guarantees the microtask is run.

Anybody know of tests anywhere for “valid email address” as defined at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address ?

[23:17:37.0622] <annevk>
smaug: yeah I think I filed an issue on that.

[23:18:32.0187] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: not sure, there's an issue on changing its definition to account for EAI

[23:18:45.0608] <annevk>

Hi, I'm working on a possible proposal to improve window.print I only see a reference about the dialog and the print media.  Where should I start this discussion? TIA

[05:32:19.0686] <annevk>
Dan Howard: I might search through whatwg/html issues on GitHub first to see if anything has already been proposed. But failing that there would be a good place.

[05:32:40.0290] <annevk>
(Though I would not expect there to be too much implementer interest in improving that API per se.)

[05:59:54.0507] <Dan Howard>
thanks

[07:29:20.0788] <annevk>
smaug: sefeng: does https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/1342#discussion_r1973386577 match how Gecko feels about `getSelection()` or are you okay with it exposing the shadow tree when the end user selects shadow tree content?

[07:55:18.0515] <annevk>
smaug: sefeng: see also https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1362

[10:57:34.0766] <smaug>
Exposing shadow tree is not ok.

I don't have a lot of hope that doing so would result in new resources magically being discovered.

For those who are unfamiliar, NativeScript has added a spec-compliant URLPattern implementation to both of their iOS and Android runtimes - https://github.com/NativeScript/ios/pull/268

[23:34:58.0795] <annevk>
Domenic: could I ask you to get someone familiar with URLPattern to comment on https://github.com/w3c/IFT/issues/259? Perhaps the URLPattern specification should have some examples as how to address URI template use cases?

[23:41:54.0646] <sideshowbarker>
I’m looking at the test case at https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/3c11c5bae7639991e1a300ad841dd53f571eecf3/html/semantics/forms/constraints/form-validation-checkValidity.html#L96 and trying to determine figure out how the expectation of false aligns with the actual spec requirements.

That test case just creates this:

```html
<input type=time value="12:03:00" step="2 * 60 * 1000">
```


[23:42:32.0325] <sideshowbarker>
So I guess the intent of that test case is, the value shouldn’t be allowed to have a `:00` seconds part.

[23:43:59.0016] <sideshowbarker>
But determining whether it’s allowed or not involves running the algorithm at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#concept-input-min-zero — the second step of which is:
> If the element has a value content attribute, and the result of applying the algorithm to convert a string to a number to the value of the value content attribute is not an error, then return that result.

[23:44:40.0444] <sideshowbarker>
So the ”step base” is the same as the value.

[23:46:03.0332] <sideshowbarker>
So then I look at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-step-attribute%3Asuffering-from-a-step-mismatch, and that says:
> When the element has an allowed value step, and the result of applying the algorithm to convert a string to a number to the string given by the element's value is a number, and that number subtracted from the step base is not an integral multiple of the allowed value step, the element is suffering from a step mismatch


[23:48:49.0506] <sideshowbarker>
“step base” - value = 0 (since “step base” is the same as the value)

[23:49:47.0588] <sideshowbarker>
…and “allowed value step” is 2 * 60 * 1000

[00:03:15.0010] <sideshowbarker>
I’m wondering if the intended requirement is instead to just use the value as-is — that is, not subtract it from “step base”

[00:04:27.0110] <sideshowbarker>
So, 12:03:00 is the number 43380000 — and 43380000 is not an integral multiple of 120000 (2 * 60 * 1000)

[00:05:37.0535] <sideshowbarker>
Or maybe I’m just misreading the spec requirement — and the spec isn’t saying to do `“step base” - value`

[00:11:57.0689] <sideshowbarker>
Or else at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#concept-input-min-zero, the 2nd step of that algorithm should just be removed — and then it would always return 0 unless there’s a `min` value or a “default step base“ defined (which is only the case for type=week)

[00:12:16.0466] <annevk>
Doesn't it create `<input type=time value="12:03:00" step="120000">`?

[00:12:43.0110] <sideshowbarker>
Yes

[00:13:04.0406] <annevk>
All browsers appear to consider that valid. Maybe the test is wrong?

[00:13:37.0733] <sideshowbarker>
Well, all of WebKit/Gecko/Blink pass that test

[00:13:41.0080] <annevk>
I don't really like the way the `input` element is organized in the specification, but I also never attempted a different approach.

[00:13:55.0997] <sideshowbarker>
Yeah I really don’t like it either

[00:14:22.0661] <sideshowbarker>
But I also don’t have any great suggestions for how else to organize it

[00:15:00.0746] <annevk>
It's weird that they all pass. Because `:invalid` doesn't match in any of them.

[00:15:01.0900] <annevk>
https://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?%3C!DOCTYPE%20html%3E%3Cstyle%3E%0A%3Ainvalid%20%7B%20background%3Ared%20%7D%0A%3C%2Fstyle%3E%0A...%3Cinput%20type%3Dtime%20value%3D%2212%3A03%3A00%22%20step%3D%22120000%22%3E

[00:16:18.0731] <sideshowbarker>
hmm, I hopes this is not one of those cases where existing engines just implemented whatever would get them passing the tests

[00:16:42.0091] <sideshowbarker>
the constraint-validation tests are not super-great tests anyway

[00:17:03.0049] <sideshowbarker>
the coverage is extremely minimal

[00:18:31.0995] <sideshowbarker>
But I’m also not super enthusiastic about being the person who has to add more test coverage for all this stuff

[00:19:46.0914] <sideshowbarker>
I think for my implementation I’m going to go ahead and drop step 2 of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#concept-input-min-zero from the implementation — with a comment saying why

[00:24:25.0113] <sideshowbarker>
Because, If I do that that, the tests pass. And also, I can’t actually make sense of that step. I mean, it seems to me that step is _always_ going to end up returning the same thing as the `value` attribute value. And that doesn’t logically seem like the “step base” for the element should always be same as the value of the `value` attribute. Instead the “step base” should just be either `min` or a “default step base“ or else just zero. That is, it’s a floor against which the value is evaluated.

[00:30:53.0767] <Domenic>
I think this is https://github.com/whatwg/urlpattern/issues/73 , right? It's indeed not something that's possible right now, but with some extra spec and implementation work, it could be.

[00:37:21.0612] <annevk>
Ah, I think you're right. Thanks.

[01:14:46.0731] <sideshowbarker>
Even if I set `value=foo` there instead, that `:invalid { background:red }` doesn’t see to do anything

[01:15:01.0378] <sideshowbarker>

[01:16:59.0437] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: oh maybe it only starts applying once there's user modifications? It's kinda weird as `valid` does apply.

[01:18:06.0509] <sideshowbarker>
Yeah I don’t know. I rightly should understand the details of this API better before trying to implement it 😆

[01:19:51.0956] <sideshowbarker>
but yeah `:invalid` does seem to only work after user modification

[01:19:55.0594] <annevk>
Hmm no, `:invalid` does not depend on end user input. Figuring this out properly would require quite a bit of time I want to spend on other things at the moment.

yeah, no worries

[01:20:39.0247] <sideshowbarker>
for now, I’ll just raise an issue about the “step base” thing

annevk smaug Are we still thinking of landing https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/1307 this week?

[07:24:42.0842] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: unclear, depends on smaug's availability and then on yours and mine if there's further feedback. He rightfully pointed out that due to the long iteration time review will take longer.

[07:24:53.0164] <smaug>
I'll try to review it asap

[07:26:13.0233] <smaug>
(which might be tomorrow)

[09:54:59.0705] <akaster>
am I correct in thinking that it's weird https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#sec-extensions-performance-interface says "Each ECMAScript global environment has ..." followed by a bunch of buffer and integer properties? It links to https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#es-environment , which ... is not where I would expect anyone to be defining properties. I would expect them to be defined as belonging to an HTML Envrionment Settings Object, or a 'WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope' (or the new intermediary added by ShadowRealms). Or belonging to an Agent or Agent Cluster. Saying that the properties belong to "the ES environment" seems pretty vague

[10:53:22.0842] <Noam Rosenthal>
Yea these are deprecated things that were shipped long ago so they're still in the spec

[10:54:00.0996] <Noam Rosenthal>
I did a lot of work to clean up resource timing ~4 years ago and there's still lots of work left :)
