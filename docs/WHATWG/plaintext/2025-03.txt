i wish there was one thing. favicons optional and not required, not asked by browsers unless site said so via manifest or <link>. i really wish… (specially as a person testing on localhost in folders and subfolders…)

Hmm, I don't think https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#await-a-stable-state works. Queuing microtasks from outside the main event loop doesn't make sense, and as far as I see, that 'await a stable state' may hang forever, since nothing guarantees the microtask is run.

Anybody know of tests anywhere for “valid email address” as defined at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address ?
