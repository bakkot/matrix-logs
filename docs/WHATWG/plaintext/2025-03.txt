i wish there was one thing. favicons optional and not required, not asked by browsers unless site said so via manifest or <link>. i really wish… (specially as a person testing on localhost in folders and subfolders…)

Hmm, I don't think https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#await-a-stable-state works. Queuing microtasks from outside the main event loop doesn't make sense, and as far as I see, that 'await a stable state' may hang forever, since nothing guarantees the microtask is run.

Anybody know of tests anywhere for “valid email address” as defined at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address ?

[23:17:37.0622] <annevk>
smaug: yeah I think I filed an issue on that.

[23:18:32.0187] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: not sure, there's an issue on changing its definition to account for EAI

[23:18:45.0608] <annevk>
* smaug: yeah I think I filed an issue on that

Hi, I'm working on a possible proposal to improve window.print I only see a reference about the dialog and the print media.  Where should I start this discussion? TIA

[05:32:19.0686] <annevk>
Dan Howard: I might search through whatwg/html issues on GitHub first to see if anything has already been proposed. But failing that there would be a good place.

[05:32:40.0290] <annevk>
(Though I would not expect there to be too much implementer interest in improving that API per se.)

[05:59:54.0507] <Dan Howard>
thanks

smaug: sefeng: does https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/1342#discussion_r1973386577 match how Gecko feels about `getSelection()` or are you okay with it exposing the shadow tree when the end user selects shadow tree content?

[07:55:18.0515] <annevk>
smaug: sefeng: see also https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1362

[10:57:34.0766] <smaug>
Exposing shadow tree is not ok.

I don't have a lot of hope that doing so would result in new resources magically being discovered.

For those who are unfamiliar, NativeScript has added a spec-compliant URLPattern implementation to both of their iOS and Android runtimes - https://github.com/NativeScript/ios/pull/268

[23:34:58.0795] <annevk>
Domenic: could I ask you to get someone familiar with URLPattern to comment on https://github.com/w3c/IFT/issues/259? Perhaps the URLPattern specification should have some examples as how to address URI template use cases?

[23:41:54.0646] <sideshowbarker>
I’m looking at the test case at https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/3c11c5bae7639991e1a300ad841dd53f571eecf3/html/semantics/forms/constraints/form-validation-checkValidity.html#L96 and trying to determine figure out how the expectation of false aligns with the actual spec requirements.

That test case just creates this:

```html
<input type=time value="12:03:00" step="2 * 60 * 1000">
```


[23:42:32.0325] <sideshowbarker>
So I guess the intent of that test case is, the value shouldn’t be allowed to have a `:00` seconds part.

[23:43:59.0016] <sideshowbarker>
But determining whether it’s allowed or not involves running the algorithm at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#concept-input-min-zero — the second step of which is:
> If the element has a value content attribute, and the result of applying the algorithm to convert a string to a number to the value of the value content attribute is not an error, then return that result.

[23:44:40.0444] <sideshowbarker>
So the ”step base” is the same as the value.

[23:46:03.0332] <sideshowbarker>
So then I look at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#the-step-attribute%3Asuffering-from-a-step-mismatch, and that says:
> When the element has an allowed value step, and the result of applying the algorithm to convert a string to a number to the string given by the element's value is a number, and that number subtracted from the step base is not an integral multiple of the allowed value step, the element is suffering from a step mismatch


[23:48:49.0506] <sideshowbarker>
“step base” - value = 0 (since “step base” is the same as the value)

[23:49:47.0588] <sideshowbarker>
…and “allowed value step” is 2 * 60 * 1000

[00:03:15.0010] <sideshowbarker>
I’m wondering if the intended requirement is instead to just use the value as-is — that is, not subtract it from “step base”

[00:04:27.0110] <sideshowbarker>
So, 12:03:00 is the number 43380000 — and 43380000 is not an integral multiple of 120000 (2 * 60 * 1000)

[00:05:37.0535] <sideshowbarker>
Or maybe I’m just misreading the spec requirement — and the spec isn’t saying to do `“step base” - value`
