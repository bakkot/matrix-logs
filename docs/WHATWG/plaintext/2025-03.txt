i wish there was one thing. favicons optional and not required, not asked by browsers unless site said so via manifest or <link>. i really wish… (specially as a person testing on localhost in folders and subfolders…)

Hmm, I don't think https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#await-a-stable-state works. Queuing microtasks from outside the main event loop doesn't make sense, and as far as I see, that 'await a stable state' may hang forever, since nothing guarantees the microtask is run.

Anybody know of tests anywhere for “valid email address” as defined at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address ?

[23:17:37.0622] <annevk>
smaug: yeah I think I filed an issue on that.

[23:18:32.0187] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: not sure, there's an issue on changing its definition to account for EAI

Hi, I'm working on a possible proposal to improve window.print I only see a reference about the dialog and the print media.  Where should I start this discussion? TIA

[05:32:19.0686] <annevk>
Dan Howard: I might search through whatwg/html issues on GitHub first to see if anything has already been proposed. But failing that there would be a good place.

[05:32:40.0290] <annevk>
(Though I would not expect there to be too much implementer interest in improving that API per se.)

[05:59:54.0507] <Dan Howard>
thanks

smaug: sefeng: does https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/1342#discussion_r1973386577 match how Gecko feels about `getSelection()` or are you okay with it exposing the shadow tree when the end user selects shadow tree content?

[07:55:18.0515] <annevk>
smaug: sefeng: see also https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1362

[10:57:34.0766] <smaug>
Exposing shadow tree is not ok.

I don't have a lot of hope that doing so would result in new resources magically being discovered.

For those who are unfamiliar, NativeScript has added a spec-compliant URLPattern implementation to both of their iOS and Android runtimes - https://github.com/NativeScript/ios/pull/268
