In https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#pointer it says "When the pointer points to nowhere c cannot be used." Does this mean in https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser that when pointer is -1 and c is used, returning a failure is inferred or that it's a bug?

[09:42:00.0117] <nektro>
step 9 says what to do if pointer is eof but not nowhere

[09:46:04.0340] <nektro>
should there be an item after step 5 checking that input is valid in encoding ?

[09:48:57.0901] <nektro>
should step 5 be moved up since step 1 is already querying the contents of input ?

[12:27:18.0447] <nektro>
or does c pointing nowhere mean "If c is" simply yields false

nektro: step 5 doesn't impact _input_ so I don't think anything is wrong there. You might be right that the scheme start state should only decrease pointer when it's not pointing to the start of _input_.

[23:54:28.0708] <nektro>
scheme start state is always at the start of input

[23:55:24.0874] <nektro>
* scheme start state is always at the start of *input*

[23:56:13.0901] <nektro>
if *encoding* doesn't affect *input* then where is *input* validated as utf-8, or is it not?

[00:03:01.0392] <annevk>
nektro: _input_ is a scalar value string, it's not a byte sequence.

[00:07:49.0286] <annevk>
I think the reason the pointer logic works in scheme start state is because after the state is over pointer gets incremented by 1 so it'll be 0 again. I agree it's not great, but reworking all that is involved.

[00:09:21.0018] <nektro>
thanks :)

annevk: https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/12021 should be good to land now. I got the ipr stuff sorted

Hi all, just a friendly reminder to post any discussion topics for this Thursday's joint CSSWG/WHATWG/OpenUI task force meeting to the meeting agenda issue: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/12012

annevk: Regarding https://wpt.fyi/results/html/semantics/forms/the-input-element?label=master&label=experimental&aligned&q=color.window.html's "Testing '#ffffff08' with color space 'limited-srgb' and with alpha (setAttribute("value"))", the test does:

1. `setAttribute("value", color)`
2. Expects value is set as alpha-less hex
3. Set `.alpha = true`
4. Expect the alpha value revives

Where does alpha revive from? "update a color well color" overwrites element's value and doesn't seem to do `getAttribute("value")`-equivalent thing. Am I missing something again?

krosylight (they/them): it's been quite a while since I worked on this, but it's possible that step 2 of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#update-a-color-well-control-color should look at the value attribute and not the value concept. Because you do want to be able to set these attributes in a somewhat arbitrary order.

[08:07:30.0969] <annevk>
Although not sure how to match that up with what WebKit is doing.

[08:07:31.0772] <krosylight (they/them)>
but that way it's more complex about what value is used...

Anyway I'll file a bug, we can talk there

[08:09:41.0304] <krosylight (they/them)>
(happy that I didn't miss details this time 🙂)

[08:12:36.0845] <annevk>
Sounds good. Please explain there how it's way more complex as I'm not immediately seeing it. I do think what that test expects is probably desirable for web developers.

AI comments are annoying. They're verbose and usually not very useful. Latest I suspect: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5867#issuecomment-3720854771

Footnotes! We finally have a use case~ Wake up Jake!

Does anybody know why firefox do a sort of implicit pointer-capture for text controls?

Edit: never mind, I get it now.

[10:51:31.0250] <Luke Warlow>
So til that for html `<a> or <area>` if you toString() them you get their href value. Is that considered esoteric legacy stuff or fair game to copy elsewhere?

[10:56:31.0298] <bkardell>
TIL too

[10:58:53.0775] <bkardell>
that has to be weird/esoteric - I kind of get it in a few cases in HTML, but even there it feels like it would be worse a lot of time.

zcorpan: tests for https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/12021 are not merged yet

[06:04:50.0557] <zcorpan>
annevk: Yep, looks like they're ready except for a nit

[06:46:29.0737] <Luke Warlow>
I'm afk but happy either way so if someone wants to push the nit change, go for it.

should the "Otherwise"s in https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-ipv6-parser under step 6.5.5.4.2 be step 3 and 4 respectively?

[00:31:40.0937] <annevk>
nektro: that seems like it would be a useful change, yeah. Are you willing to make it?

[00:44:20.0992] <nektro>
sure thing 👍️
