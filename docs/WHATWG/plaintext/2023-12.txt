To supplement this I've started writing down my understanding of how this is all supposed to fit together and how we're going to map the spec to Ladybird here, beginning with the JS concepts: https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/22107/files

Note that Firefox wrongly supports unordered list styles on ordered lists and vice-versa

The history of people trying to spec ol/ul/li styling using CSS is very fraught... I think Firefox got furthest but IIRC it still had lots of edge cases. Things like start and reverse really stress the system.

akaster: looks pretty solid, the one piece I'm missing is an explicit callout that the reason we have agents (and not just realms and realm clusters) is because of deficiencies in early web platform design where Window objects could manipulate each other directly through various <iframe> and popup APIs

akaster: although maybe you're planning on covering that in the TODO section, heh

jarhar: are the current ideas for https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9799 written down somewhere, or perhaps some simple examples of what it would look like?

I definitely do like the idea of reusing existing elements

zcorpan: I'm trying to write about sizes=auto, and confusing myself. If you hadn't tried to do anything with "concrete size ignoring natural dimensions" and had just used current clientWidth, would it have been racy/cyclical? It feels like "obviously yes" but in the cases I'm working through, the intrinsic dimensions stay locked to whatever the initial extrinsic dimensions were, because of the density-correction mechanism.

The link element's disabled IDL attribute reflects the content attribute of the same name, whereas the style's disabled IDL attribute has no such content attribute. What principles in general decide whether we should reflect or not?

[12:32:35.0535] <akaster>
I actually didn't know that was the reason why, but it definitely makes sense. Agents feel like a bit of a strange abstraction over realms
