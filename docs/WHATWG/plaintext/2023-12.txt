To supplement this I've started writing down my understanding of how this is all supposed to fit together and how we're going to map the spec to Ladybird here, beginning with the JS concepts: https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/pull/22107/files

Note that Firefox wrongly supports unordered list styles on ordered lists and vice-versa

The history of people trying to spec ol/ul/li styling using CSS is very fraught... I think Firefox got furthest but IIRC it still had lots of edge cases. Things like start and reverse really stress the system.

akaster: looks pretty solid, the one piece I'm missing is an explicit callout that the reason we have agents (and not just realms and realm clusters) is because of deficiencies in early web platform design where Window objects could manipulate each other directly through various <iframe> and popup APIs

akaster: although maybe you're planning on covering that in the TODO section, heh

jarhar: are the current ideas for https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9799 written down somewhere, or perhaps some simple examples of what it would look like?

I definitely do like the idea of reusing existing elements
