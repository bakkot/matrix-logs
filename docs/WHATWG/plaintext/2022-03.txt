annevk: Thanks for the review! I wonder if I should remove "The user agent may ignore the node for the purposes of text search
   (commonly known as "find in page")." altogether. No implementation currently does this (unless aria-hidden nodes are ignored in some contexts).

[08:22:55.0849] <ntim>
annevk: also, about "This data-x-href needs to move to where the other data-x-hrefs are.", where are the other data-x-hrefs typically?

[08:23:11.0862] <Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰>
"dependencies" section?

[08:23:50.0586] <ntim>
ah makes sense thank you

[08:45:15.0888] <annevk>
ntim: I don't have a strong opinion, how do UAs deal with it then? Wouldn't searching result in selection?

[09:00:50.0182] <ntim>
annevk: searching results in highlighting, not necessarily selection

[09:02:15.0852] <ntim>
(anyway, I addressed all your comments)

[09:06:22.0020] <annevk>
Ah yeah, for some reason I thought you could copy-and-paste the currently highlighted one, but that's not a thing

[09:06:41.0343] <annevk>
Still might be frustrating if you can search and find, but not select and copy

[09:11:59.0901] <annevk>
Thanks ntim! Reviewed again. I suspect we'll wait with landing until next week btw as it's a somewhat big change so Domenic should probably be around.

[09:17:15.0774] <ntim>
> Can you edit without selection? Are execCommand() calls prohibited? How does this actually affect the Selection API, come to think of it?

Not sure how to spec this formally aside from this matches `user-select: none` + `-webkit-user-modify: readonly`

[09:17:26.0094] <ntim>
annevk: ^

[09:18:38.0726] <ntim>
https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/inert/inert-and-contenteditable.tentative.html

[09:18:59.0453] <ntim>
it would be like execCommand on a non-editable node

[09:19:37.0294] <ntim>
I guess it would reasonable to reference user-select

[09:21:49.0042] <annevk>
That would help. Do we have some tests around this? Creating a Selection object and trying to assign it nodes from an inert tree?

[09:22:28.0896] <annevk>
It's unfortunate none of these specs are defined to that level of detail, but I guess making it clear they should behave the same is a start...

[09:22:37.0199] <annevk>
emilio thoughts on the above?

[09:22:47.0489] <ntim>
https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/inert/inert-node-is-unselectable.tentative.html

[09:22:59.0121] <ntim>
uses execCommand("selectAll")

[09:29:21.0228] <ntim>
annevk: The "The user agent may ignore the node for the purposes of text search (commonly known as
   "find in page")." bit, is there more from an a11y standpoint I think, e.g. inert should behave like aria-hidden

[09:29:46.0993] <ntim>
and the UA may choose to ignore aria-hidden nodes from text search if they want

[09:30:05.0180] <annevk>
Okay, let's keep it then, no?

[09:30:05.0359] <ntim>
(It was there before my PR fwiw)

[09:30:10.0595] <ntim>
sounds good

[09:36:30.0987] <ntim>
annevk: I clarified the bits around editing and selection

[09:42:46.0084] <annevk>
ntim: cool, looks good to me modulo nit about using data-x="" instead of dfn

[09:43:36.0723] <ntim>
annevk: <code data-x=""> by itself seems to complain too

[09:45:05.0055] <ntim>
like "none" needs to be defined at least once

[09:45:06.0480] <ntim>
Error: missing <dfn> for topic "inert-css-property-value-none" from 2 sites including explicitly from <code> element containing "none"; previous heading contents are "6.3 Inert subtrees"
Error: missing <dfn> for topic "inert-css-property-value-none" from 2 sites including explicitly from <code> element containing "none"; previous heading contents are "6.3 Inert subtrees"
Error count: 2


[09:47:20.0309] <annevk>
ntim: that means you still use `inert-css-property-value-none` somewhere

[09:47:35.0921] <annevk>
ntim: instead you should have `<code data-x="">none</code>`

[09:48:09.0237] <ntim>
oh empty string

[09:50:15.0748] <ntim>
thanks! that does seem to work

[09:53:06.0886] <ntim>
annevk: something I was wondering is putting the "blocked by a modal dialog" stuff in its own subsection before or after the "inert attribute" one.

[09:53:35.0016] <ntim>
but it's fine as it is too I guess

[09:56:25.0188] <annevk>
/me looks

[09:58:33.0456] <annevk>
ntim: up to you, I agree it could work

[10:00:04.0787] <annevk>
I wonder if inert only applying to Text/Element has implications elsewhere; I guess Text includes CDATASection and Comment/ProcessingInstruction/ShadowRoot are never rendered, so it prolly doesn't matter

(not asking to ask, just asking for future reference) is WCAG discussion relevant here, or is there a better place? doesn't have to be on matrix.

perhaps ask in https://matrix.to/#/#accessibility:mozilla.org
