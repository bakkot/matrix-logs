annevk: Thanks for the review! I wonder if I should remove "The user agent may ignore the node for the purposes of text search
   (commonly known as "find in page")." altogether. No implementation currently does this (unless aria-hidden nodes are ignored in some contexts).

annevk: also, about "This data-x-href needs to move to where the other data-x-hrefs are.", where are the other data-x-hrefs typically?

[08:23:11.0862] <Ms2ger ðŸ’‰ðŸ’‰>
"dependencies" section?

[08:23:50.0586] <ntim>
ah makes sense thank you

[08:45:15.0888] <annevk>
ntim: I don't have a strong opinion, how do UAs deal with it then? Wouldn't searching result in selection?

[09:00:50.0182] <ntim>
annevk: searching results in highlighting, not necessarily selection

[09:02:15.0852] <ntim>
(anyway, I addressed all your comments)

[09:06:22.0020] <annevk>
Ah yeah, for some reason I thought you could copy-and-paste the currently highlighted one, but that's not a thing

[09:06:41.0343] <annevk>
Still might be frustrating if you can search and find, but not select and copy

[09:11:59.0901] <annevk>
Thanks ntim! Reviewed again. I suspect we'll wait with landing until next week btw as it's a somewhat big change so Domenic should probably be around.
