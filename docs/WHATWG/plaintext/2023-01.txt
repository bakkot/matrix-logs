kblom3: frank-dspeed: while we're not super strict regarding what is on and off topic, this channel is generally intended for discussions about web standards, and primarily WHATWG standards.

[02:18:21.0506] <frank-dspeed>
i guess your correct i am still struggling with correcting my mind model but your right it was my failure this channel is only about WHATWG related stuff not about internet or web or browsers and WHATWG is a standard that is open to get used by people who like it and ignored by people who do not agree with it 

[02:19:51.0228] <frank-dspeed>
i want to apologice for that it is really a missconception in my mind because as i was a kid i expected internet to be equal to WHATWG 

[02:20:58.0635] <frank-dspeed>
and that was still holding me back i need to pray to my self that browsers are not related to whatwg as it is a indipendent free standard without any affilation to real world

[02:32:38.0355] <frank-dspeed>
the real world is equal to the browsers dom api's and HTML is just a syntax that can get translated to it so it is a declarativ instruction set a language not more not less 

[02:33:42.0210] <frank-dspeed>
frameworks like react circumvent the WHATWG standard total while still use the term html which is maybe also missleading
