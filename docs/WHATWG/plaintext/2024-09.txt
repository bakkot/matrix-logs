Anybody know if it’s intentional that there’s no `ariaRelevant` IDL attribute in https://w3c.github.io/aria/#ARIAMixin?

[19:26:01.0322] <sideshowbarker>
The current spec does define an [`aria-relevant`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-relevant) content attribute, and at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#idl-reflection-attribute-values the spec says:
> All ARIA attributes reflect in IDL as [nullable](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-nullable-type) [DOMString](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-DOMString) attributes. This includes the boolean-like [true/false](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#valuetype_true-false) type, and all other ARIA attributes.

…and https://wpt.fyi/results/html/dom/aria-attribute-reflection.html has a test for a reflected `ariaRelevant` IDL attribute

[19:28:22.0535] <sideshowbarker>
So… it is just a spec bug/oversight that the spec has no ariaRelevant IDL attribute in https://w3c.github.io/aria/#ARIAMixin?

*(And incidentally, is it seriously really the case that the Matrix Element client still provides no per-case way to prevent previews from getting added every time somebody includes a hyperlink in a message?)*

hmm, it seems that in source at https://github.com/w3c/aria/blob/1d0b8b94120beb6fa36edd54fce1a301ce64930c/index.html#L13584, it’s intentionally commented out

[19:44:40.0146] <sideshowbarker>
seems James Craig commented in out in https://github.com/w3c/aria/commit/646f093848a1943c8343f34ad80f72dbd78f54e6 without explanation…
