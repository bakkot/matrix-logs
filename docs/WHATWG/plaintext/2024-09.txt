Anybody know if it’s intentional that there’s no `ariaRelevant` IDL attribute in https://w3c.github.io/aria/#ARIAMixin?

[19:26:01.0322] <sideshowbarker>
The current spec does define an [`aria-relevant`](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-relevant) content attribute, and at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#idl-reflection-attribute-values the spec says:
> All ARIA attributes reflect in IDL as [nullable](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-nullable-type) [DOMString](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-DOMString) attributes. This includes the boolean-like [true/false](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#valuetype_true-false) type, and all other ARIA attributes.

[19:27:40.0858] <sideshowbarker>
…and https://wpt.fyi/results/html/dom/aria-attribute-reflection.html has a test for a reflected `ariaRelevant` IDL attribute

[19:28:22.0535] <sideshowbarker>
So… it is just a spec bug/oversight that the spec has no ariaRelevant IDL attribute in https://w3c.github.io/aria/#ARIAMixin?

[19:30:05.0525] <sideshowbarker>
*(And incidentally, is it seriously really the case that the Matrix Element client still provides no per-case way to prevent previews from getting added every time somebody includes a hyperlink in a message?)*

I wonder how to fix Observables to work with preventDefault(). I think that is a blocker

[08:50:43.0525] <annevk>
smaug: I thought that worked unless you switched to promises?

[08:54:42.0369] <smaug>
exactly, the part of the API using Promises breaks it

[09:02:50.0849] <annevk>
smaug: https://github.com/WICG/observable/issues/170 might also be of interest

[09:50:12.0772] <Yoav Weiss>
I'm working through this [comment](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10528/files/e9188a30c6e0bfb1c163555fed3104d173059364#r1712799332) on the dynamic import maps PR, and I'm realizing that it's not clear to me if the normalized scope prefixes could actually be an absolute URL, and whether that URL could be coming from a different origin/site than the top-level site loading the script. AFAICT the answer to that is yes, but I'm failing to find tests to that effect


2024-09-03
[23:33:33.0924] <freddy>
Very slightly related to import maps. I talked to someone about Subresource Integrity and they complained that `<script src=.. integrity..>` has no declarative fallback to a canonical/fallback URL if the `src` resource doesn't match. E.g., point to CDN for speed but fallback to same-origin resource for robustness. I recall that we cut `fallbacksrc` (name TBD) out of SRI v1 for a couple of reason. The main one I remember is that I was too cautious to break assumptions w/ HTML/XSS sanitizers and other security libraries. Essentially not allowing a "new" XSS vector like `<script src=x integrity=x fallbacksrc=xssurl>`.

[23:34:49.0872] <freddy>
I wonder if fallback-URLs would be an interesting thing to consider for import maps, as their syntax is not in HTML and less likely to break assumptions (because most libraries will block/remove inline `<script>`, likely including those of type import maps)

[04:20:14.0190] <Yoav Weiss>
freddy: I guess that could fit into importmaps somehow, but would only work for modules. At the same time, I'm not sure the use case is worth the complexity. Is this a real issue people are trying to solve for? Can they do that with e.g. onerror handlers that rewrite the `src`?

[04:20:37.0524] <freddy>
they _can_ solve it with onerror handlers, but it requires more script

[04:20:55.0758] <freddy>
(script that needs to load first. stuff you originally set out to put on a CDN)

[04:35:37.0675] <Yoav Weiss>
(beyond that, I don't see the onerror event firing.. https://iron-organic-rainstorm.glitch.me/)

[05:08:23.0566] <freddy>
huh..

[05:29:05.0894] <zcorpan>

Hi, I am wondering what is the rationale behind the difference between`location.href` and `document.URL` when credentials are embedded (e.g. https://foo:bar@example.com). Using the former would return an URl without credentials (http://example.com) and the latter would give me the full URL. My best guess here is that since `Location` object provides developers a way to navigate through links, therefore there are security concerns and credentials need to be redacted. And since browsers treat `Document` as an abstraction for the current web document, the property is readonly and not redacted. Could someone kindly disprove or verify my theory? Thanks in advance!

[11:42:12.0637] <Meo>

I don't think that's the case for Chrome (128.0.6613.113). As I just tried few moments ago, it gives out different results.

[11:53:12.0917] <annevk>
Meo: I'd file a bug against Chrome (and other browsers that exhibit that behavior). Potentially if all browsers do this we need to investigate this at the specification level (file an issue against the HTML Standard for that), but it doesn't seem like something we'd want to standardize as it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

[11:56:17.0904] <Meo>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> Meo: that seems like a bug. They are defined to be identical.

By the way, could you please kindly shed some light on which part of the spec specify on this? Because in my opinion, if 'they are defined to be identical' then it is already something standardized? Please kindly correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks for the link. If I understand it correctly, the associated URL `location.href` should be the same as `document.URL`? If that's the case then almost all web browsers violated this spec.

Sine from the multiple browser sources I read, Firefox implemented this redaction since pre-1.0 era. Chromium did it ~2010, and WebKit followed sometime later.

Hey folks! I might have missed this in the spec, but it seems that all browsers will automatically show subtitles if the `video` element has a `track` with the `default` boolean attribute. Is this in the specification and I missed it, or is this not yet documented as the intended behaviour? Thanks!

[13:01:56.0039] <annevk>
Meo: I know about address bar redaction, but API redaction is new to me and would definitely have to be standardized somehow

Yeah I totally agreed, and for clarification I was referring to the API-level redaction.

In the Service Worker spec, it talks about "service worker clients" as being "an environment". https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#service-worker-client-concept

Is the right mental model for this concept that the service worker spec is applying a mixin or extension to the HTML specification's definition of environment? or is there any utility in representing the service worker client as a distinct object in an implementation?


2024-09-05
[18:05:24.0970] <Domenic>
akaster: my reading of that is that it's a subclass of environment with a couple extra fields.

[18:15:30.0447] <akaster>
hmm. the section that describes how service worker clients are created, specifically for the window client case, it links to`Set up a window environment settings object`. 
https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#control-and-use-window-client

Which is here: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/nav-history-apis.html#set-up-a-window-environment-settings-object

[18:15:42.0229] <akaster>

[18:16:30.0353] <akaster>
I suppose the section there doesn't say "create a window environment settings object" as if that's a well-defined thing. it just says "Create a environment settings object with these properties/method implementations"/

[18:16:31.0905] <akaster>
 * I suppose the section there doesn't say "create a window environment settings object" as if that's a well-defined thing. it just says "Create a environment settings object with these properties/method implementations".

[18:17:29.0666] <akaster>
So I don't feel too bad about mushing the fields for the "window client" for service workers and the ESO in step 3 of set up a window environment settings object into the same C++ object 

[18:30:33.0516] <akaster>
> A service worker client has an algorithm defined as the origin that returns the service worker client's origin if the service worker client is an environment settings object, and the service worker client's creation URL’s origin otherwise.

Er... when would a service worker client *not* be an environment settings object? All the cases described in section 2.5 are a service worker client created from either  `Set up a window environment settings object` or `Set up a worker environment settings object`.

[19:03:01.0608] <Domenic>
My vague recollection is that service workers control even environments, in the steps before they become ESOs.

keithamus: is GitHub still using the navigation API? https://x.com/Keithamus/status/1634212599083548674

[00:47:22.0235] <keithamus>
Domenic: it was removed back in January as we haven’t seen interest from other browsers. 

[00:53:18.0856] <Domenic>
It's a progressive enhancement...

[00:53:36.0355] <Domenic>
(with positive standards positions from both others, and an implementation nearing completion in WebKit!)

Chris Harrelson: Can you please invite me to the open ui/html/css meeting?

[01:40:00.0758] <smaug>
I did

[01:47:31.0565] <zcorpan>
Thanks

[01:56:41.0129] <keithamus>
Domenic: I know, sorry. I agree but we try to avoid shipping features that aren't in multiple browsers so it was stuck behind a feature flag which means it's regularly assessed for removal unless it can progress. I wasn't able to progress it and so it got removed :( 

[02:11:52.0309] <Domenic>
I had a conflict today, sadly.

[02:25:05.0338] <Domenic>
Maybe we can retry after WebKit lands

Hey everyone, new to Matrix so hopefully this is the right place to ask.

What was the reasoning making the `<details>` element firing the `ontoggle` event when it renders with `open` attribute being present?

We use Next.js/React at work, and I think most devs expect that most events are triggered by something done by the user, like `onchange`, `onsubmit`, `onclick`.
So it isn't far-fetched to assume a dev would believe `ontoggle` would be triggered when the `<details>` is opened/closed and not necessarily because it has mounted/rendered open.

Maybe I'm misreading this GitHub issue but if I'm reading it correctly, it does sound like there were some concerns about that as well - https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4500
