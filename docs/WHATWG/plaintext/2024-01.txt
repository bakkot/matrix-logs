annevk: right, what is the next step? It's still doesn't touch the **custom element reactions stack**

[23:58:58.0165] <annevk>
Oh, I was confusing it with the queue. I think the stack is being used when for instance a custom element is being constructed and its constructor uses a thing with CEReactions.

[08:24:01.0762] <Dominic Farolino>
We often check for detached documents by checking if some relevant global object "is a Window" and that it's associated doc is fully active. Is there is an equivalent we need to do for workers/other globals?

[08:24:16.0682] <Dominic Farolino>
Can workers ever become "detached" or "inactive" in the same way that requires this checking?

[08:25:38.0952] <Dominic Farolino>
I'm writing a spec for an interface that is being introduced to Window and Workers, but I have a bunch of "relevant global object's active Document is fully active" checks. But that's obviously insufficient for Workers, so I'm trying to figure out if I need a similar check for those environments or not

[08:49:43.0094] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: I think in theory a worker can be bfcache'd and then it'd prolly apply, but that's poorly defined

+1 that it would be lovely for org admins and moderators to be able to see an org-wide view of reported content. Then folks wouldn't need to know to forward spam to keithamus; they could just use Github's reporting API.

Should Infra have any advice on how specs should use exceptions? https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#algorithm-control-flow says algorithms can throw, and the exception will silently propagate up the stack, but I feel like it's a best practice to at least mention which algorithms can throw.

I want to propose allowing `blocking=render` on inline scripts, would that be a "new feature" or a "new issue"?

Jeffrey Yasskin: I don't think WHATWG specs mention it. IDL doesn't either. It is typically mentioned in domintro boxes though. But we could change all of that I suppose.

Is there something in HTML that would trim whitespace from nonce attributes? https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/urls-and-fetching.html#nonce-does-not-update-dom doesn't at least, but I am not sure how attributes from the parser are handled.

[07:52:31.0439] <annevk>

I don't want to change what experienced spec authors are doing, just try to document it better, if there is actually a pattern to document. My impression was that WHATWG specs usually return "failure" from algorithm steps and then only convert that to an exception when implementing a WebIDL operation. For example, https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-url-url converts failure to an exception in the URL constructor, and https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-global-fetch does the same conversion from network error to rejection. Some of the helper algorithms for WebIDL operations do throw without mentioning it in their interfaces, but the deeper layers seem to prefer returns.

This usually makes sense to me because "throwing" means that there's some catching semantic, and that's not guaranteed when you're in an internal operation (e.g. it could be an `in parallel` operation)

[11:54:14.0704] <bakkot>
does anyone know why getRandomValues has a size limit? I poked around the git history and mailing lists but couldn't find it offhand

[13:53:23.0892] <annevk>
Jeffrey Yasskin: I think that's right. Just like you would (might?) return std::nullopt in C++ over an exception.

[13:59:13.0895] <annevk>
bakkot: I found it predates git but not super motivated to dig into the CVS history

[13:59:35.0206] <annevk>

"becomes browsing-context connected" also applies for parser-inserted elements. The parser doesn't trim whitespace for nonce attributes, nor anything else in the spec AFAICT.

(Trying to find examples of attributes that aren't reflected.)

[17:04:17.0827] <Domenic>
There should be 0 such attributes, although maybe one slipped in around... Shadow parts, IIRC? Because rniwa hated DOMTokenList or something like that, so we just gave up on getting consensus for how to reflect it?

[23:00:22.0834] <annevk>
Shadow parts is also not properly standardized still maybe? At least the DOM aspects are not in HTML or DOM as they ought to be.

[00:14:49.0183] <Noam Rosenthal>
Is there a standard way to say “perform this operation after this promise resolves *including all its reactions* or it’s a matter of adding a microtask checkpoint?

[00:25:49.0705] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: do you know if the old CVS history for specifications can still be found somewhere?

[00:31:56.0070] <sideshowbarker>
annevk: For W3C specs, I think no — not any longer. Not the original CVS history itself at least. because since CVS is a client-server thing, W3C would need have the CVS server running — or at least have the filesystem thing that CVS served from still saved.

[00:34:27.0257] <sideshowbarker>
Well, with the exception of anything that we served from www.w3.org or w3.org URLs — that all still exists in CVS. (And is still being added to — W3C is still using CVS to maintain large parts of w3.org content, and till adding to it via CVS.)

[00:35:45.0529] <annevk>
Does anyone still have a copy that they could stuff in a git repository somehow?

[00:36:12.0075] <sideshowbarker>
It depends on which spec

[00:36:35.0181] <sideshowbarker>
If it were served from dev.w3.org org, then yeah I think we could manage to find copies.

[00:36:50.0138] <annevk>
Web Crypto came up above.

[00:37:45.0171] <sideshowbarker>
OK

[00:37:54.0260] <sideshowbarker>
I will do some digging

[00:38:20.0899] <sideshowbarker>
Given that for dev.w3.org at least, I think you remember that in the pre-github days, we (in many cases, me) migrated all of dvcs.w3.org content to Mercurial. So that still may exist somewhere — at least in local clones (maybe some things even on my own laptop).

[00:39:00.0744] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: the Mercurial copy I found suggests there's more history in CVS; they started anew

[00:39:18.0325] <annevk>

[00:42:22.0205] <sideshowbarker>

[00:44:53.0635] <annevk>
Oh wow, I found something by going through the W3C lists

[00:45:15.0744] <annevk>
It involves Ms2ger (back in 2024 W2)

https://wiki.whatwg.org/index.php?title=Crypto&action=history

[00:45:20.0876] <sideshowbarker>
Yeah, I was just now typing this: I vaguely recall that we might have once had a mailing list set up, to which all dvcs.w3.org commit messages were archived (even i n CVS ldays)

[00:46:30.0216] <annevk>
And https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=440046#c43 has the answer bakkot was looking for

[00:46:44.0043] <sideshowbarker>
excellent

[00:46:47.0054] <annevk>
UI responsiveness is the reason for the limit in Web Crypto

[00:56:32.0000] <sideshowbarker>
hmm but was that browser-UI-responsiveness problem only an issue for Firefox in the years before multi-process?

[00:57:07.0589] <sideshowbarker>
that is, is it actually still relevant at all any longer?

[00:58:03.0103] <sideshowbarker>
…though I guess it might be a moot question, if browser projects are interested in going back and touching that part of the existing web-crypto code

[00:58:11.0346] <annevk>
Blocking the main thread is still a concern.

[00:58:12.0065] <sideshowbarker>
 * …though I guess it might be a moot question, if browser projects are not interested in going back and touching that part of the existing web-crypto code

[00:58:17.0652] <sideshowbarker>
ah OK

[00:59:18.0168] <annevk>
But yeah, bit unclear if that's a good enough reason to have a limit as there's a lot of ways to block it.

[07:11:29.0406] <bakkot>
aha! thanks much annevk

Has there been any discussion around non-CSS custom cursors (i.e. an element that follows the mouse coords) and top-layer? top-layer effectively breaks all existing solutions.

I’ve been able to abuse a manual popover to keep the cursor on top (https://codepen.io/knowler/pen/PoLNNKB), but that’s not perfect since there’s no reliable way of knowing when something new becomes the topmost top-layer.

I will admit that non-CSS custom cursors aren’t great, but it’s not uncommon. Seems like maybe a document author use-case for the `overlay` property or maybe something CSS needs to allow better customization around (specifically in regard to animation which is generally why people implement custom cursors this way).

[23:36:49.0788] <annevk>
knowler: I think a write-up on https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/new explaining why CSS custom cursors exist and how they're running into issues due to the top layer would be helpful. Keep https://whatwg.org/faq#adding-new-features in mind, in particular 1.
