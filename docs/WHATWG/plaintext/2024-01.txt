annevk: right, what is the next step? It's still doesn't touch the **custom element reactions stack**

[23:58:58.0165] <annevk>
Oh, I was confusing it with the queue. I think the stack is being used when for instance a custom element is being constructed and its constructor uses a thing with CEReactions.

[08:24:01.0762] <Dominic Farolino>
We often check for detached documents by checking if some relevant global object "is a Window" and that it's associated doc is fully active. Is there is an equivalent we need to do for workers/other globals?

[08:24:16.0682] <Dominic Farolino>
Can workers ever become "detached" or "inactive" in the same way that requires this checking?

[08:25:38.0952] <Dominic Farolino>
I'm writing a spec for an interface that is being introduced to Window and Workers, but I have a bunch of "relevant global object's active Document is fully active" checks. But that's obviously insufficient for Workers, so I'm trying to figure out if I need a similar check for those environments or not

[08:49:43.0094] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: I think in theory a worker can be bfcache'd and then it'd prolly apply, but that's poorly defined

+1 that it would be lovely for org admins and moderators to be able to see an org-wide view of reported content. Then folks wouldn't need to know to forward spam to keithamus; they could just use Github's reporting API.

Should Infra have any advice on how specs should use exceptions? https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#algorithm-control-flow says algorithms can throw, and the exception will silently propagate up the stack, but I feel like it's a best practice to at least mention which algorithms can throw.

I want to propose allowing `blocking=render` on inline scripts, would that be a "new feature" or a "new issue"?

Jeffrey Yasskin: I don't think WHATWG specs mention it. IDL doesn't either. It is typically mentioned in domintro boxes though. But we could change all of that I suppose.

Is there something in HTML that would trim whitespace from nonce attributes? https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/urls-and-fetching.html#nonce-does-not-update-dom doesn't at least, but I am not sure how attributes from the parser are handled.

I don't want to change what experienced spec authors are doing, just try to document it better, if there is actually a pattern to document. My impression was that WHATWG specs usually return "failure" from algorithm steps and then only convert that to an exception when implementing a WebIDL operation. For example, https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-url-url converts failure to an exception in the URL constructor, and https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-global-fetch does the same conversion from network error to rejection. Some of the helper algorithms for WebIDL operations do throw without mentioning it in their interfaces, but the deeper layers seem to prefer returns.

This usually makes sense to me because "throwing" means that there's some catching semantic, and that's not guaranteed when you're in an internal operation (e.g. it could be an `in parallel` operation)

[11:54:14.0704] <bakkot>
does anyone know why getRandomValues has a size limit? I poked around the git history and mailing lists but couldn't find it offhand

[13:53:23.0892] <annevk>
Jeffrey Yasskin: I think that's right. Just like you would (might?) return std::nullopt in C++ over an exception.

[13:59:13.0895] <annevk>
bakkot: I found it predates git but not super motivated to dig into the CVS history

[13:59:35.0206] <annevk>

"becomes browsing-context connected" also applies for parser-inserted elements. The parser doesn't trim whitespace for nonce attributes, nor anything else in the spec AFAICT.

(Trying to find examples of attributes that aren't reflected.)

[17:04:17.0827] <Domenic>
There should be 0 such attributes, although maybe one slipped in around... Shadow parts, IIRC? Because rniwa hated DOMTokenList or something like that, so we just gave up on getting consensus for how to reflect it?

Shadow parts is also not properly standardized still maybe? At least the DOM aspects are not in HTML or DOM as they ought to be.

[00:14:49.0183] <Noam Rosenthal>
Is there a standard way to say “perform this operation after this promise resolves *including all its reactions* or it’s a matter of adding a microtask checkpoint?

[00:25:49.0705] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: do you know if the old CVS history for specifications can still be found somewhere?

[00:31:56.0070] <sideshowbarker>
annevk: For W3C specs, I think no — not any longer. Not the original CVS history itself at least. because since CVS is a client-server thing, W3C would need have the CVS server running — or at least have the filesystem thing that CVS served from still saved.

[00:34:27.0257] <sideshowbarker>
Well, with the exception of anything that we served from www.w3.org or w3.org URLs — that all still exists in CVS. (And is still being added to — W3C is still using CVS to maintain large parts of w3.org content, and till adding to it via CVS.)

[00:35:45.0529] <annevk>
Does anyone still have a copy that they could stuff in a git repository somehow?

[00:36:12.0075] <sideshowbarker>
It depends on which spec

[00:36:35.0181] <sideshowbarker>
If it were served from dev.w3.org org, then yeah I think we could manage to find copies.

[00:36:50.0138] <annevk>
Web Crypto came up above.

[00:37:45.0171] <sideshowbarker>
OK

[00:37:54.0260] <sideshowbarker>
I will do some digging

[00:38:20.0899] <sideshowbarker>
Given that for dev.w3.org at least, I think you remember that in the pre-github days, we (in many cases, me) migrated all of dvcs.w3.org content to Mercurial. So that still may exist somewhere — at least in local clones (maybe some things even on my own laptop).

[00:39:00.0744] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: the Mercurial copy I found suggests there's more history in CVS; they started anew

[00:39:18.0325] <annevk>

https://wiki.whatwg.org/index.php?title=Crypto&action=history

[00:45:20.0876] <sideshowbarker>
Yeah, I was just now typing this: I vaguely recall that we might have once had a mailing list set up, to which all dvcs.w3.org commit messages were archived (even i n CVS ldays)

[00:46:30.0216] <annevk>
And https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=440046#c43 has the answer bakkot was looking for

UI responsiveness is the reason for the limit in Web Crypto

[00:56:32.0000] <sideshowbarker>
hmm but was that browser-UI-responsiveness problem only an issue for Firefox in the years before multi-process?

[00:57:07.0589] <sideshowbarker>
that is, is it actually still relevant at all any longer?

[00:58:03.0103] <sideshowbarker>
…though I guess it might be a moot question, if browser projects are interested in going back and touching that part of the existing web-crypto code

[00:58:11.0346] <annevk>
Blocking the main thread is still a concern.

Has there been any discussion around non-CSS custom cursors (i.e. an element that follows the mouse coords) and top-layer? top-layer effectively breaks all existing solutions.

I’ve been able to abuse a manual popover to keep the cursor on top (https://codepen.io/knowler/pen/PoLNNKB), but that’s not perfect since there’s no reliable way of knowing when something new becomes the topmost top-layer.

I will admit that non-CSS custom cursors aren’t great, but it’s not uncommon. Seems like maybe a document author use-case for the `overlay` property or maybe something CSS needs to allow better customization around (specifically in regard to animation which is generally why people implement custom cursors this way).

[23:36:49.0788] <annevk>
knowler: I think a write-up on https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/new explaining why CSS custom cursors exist and how they're running into issues due to the top layer would be helpful. Keep https://whatwg.org/faq#adding-new-features in mind, in particular 1.

PSA: If you see a spam PR or issue, please label it with `invalid`. That's a label recognized by GitHub's tooling and I'm in the process of adding it to all the repositories of WHATWG standards.

[06:29:12.0878] <chargeitall>
why default is written twice?

[06:52:06.0083] <zcorpan>
"default value" is a placeholder

[06:53:38.0374] <chargeitall>
why it is not written with italic like the parameter placeholder ?

[06:56:24.0915] <zcorpan>
"parameter" is a placeholder for a variable name. See the example below.

[07:07:41.0412] <chargeitall>
the example below is for an algorithm parameter not a variable parameter. A variable is declared with "let" and changed with "set"

[07:30:44.0755] <chargeitall>

To clarify, you are uncertain whether to use italics for the second instance of target?

Dark mode styles are being deployed. Seems that on non-HTML, this is causing us to get W3C colors temporarily. Hopefully this will stop once the bikeshed-boilerplate stuff propagates through the ecosystem?

[20:28:25.0802] <Domenic>
Yeah, not clear how often api.csswg.org gets updated, but until it gets the latest `bikeshed update`, we have W3C colors on all WHATWG specs :(

[20:30:33.0186] <Domenic>
If we want to resurrect https://github.com/whatwg/spec-factory/pull/42 and https://github.com/whatwg/whatwg.org/pull/404/ we could fix I guess

[23:50:24.0698] <Kaiido>
Looks like https://resources.whatwg.org/standard.css uses a few hard-coded colors that don't really match with the dark-mode? The ones I spotted are `.element` (which is particularly outstanding), and the top links of the full page `#head nav > div > a[...]`. There a few others but they seem less problematic (like `figure.diagrams`).

[01:57:50.0635] <Domenic>
TabAtkins: sorry to ping while you're on vacation, but any idea how often the CSSWG API server runs `bikeshed update` to pull in new boilerplates?

[02:00:15.0279] <annevk>
I thought that was instant. But you might have to trigger builds for each standard?

[02:00:21.0251] <Domenic>
No, it's not instant

[02:00:29.0125] <Domenic>
It may pull in new bikeshed releases, but it doesn't do bikeshed update

[02:00:53.0348] <Domenic>
We will *also* need to trigger new builds, but only after the CSSWG API updates

[02:01:20.0645] <Domenic>
(You can test this by running `make remote` locally on any spec; you get one with the wrong boilerplate. Whereas if you run `bikeshed update; make local`, you get the right boilerplate.)

[02:01:22.0823] <annevk>
I think the problem is that Tab didn't generate new manifest files

[02:01:29.0232] <Domenic>
That's done automatically

[02:05:49.0894] <Domenic>
Python 2 vs. 3? Or 3.11 vs. 3.12 or something maybe

[02:07:19.0773] <annevk>
Bingo, okay, I'll push an updated manifest

Though I guess it shouldn't matter since bikeshed-data indeed appears to be source of truth. Hmm.

[05:03:59.0453] <TabAtkins>
Ah and sorry, you merged the thing that needed coordination while I wasn't around 😃

[07:01:21.0997] <annevk>
TabAtkins: I suspect Domenic might be afk for a while, but let me know if there's anything remaining I could help with

[07:01:53.0033] <TabAtkins>
I'm still not technically around into next Monday but if something needs poking I can fix

[07:03:10.0638] <annevk>
TabAtkins: I think Domenic was saying that it appears as if api.csswg.org isn't updated

[07:03:30.0836] <annevk>
TabAtkins: and that's why various specifications are now W3C blue instead of WHATWG green

If there's one thing bikeshed should do well, it's painting in the right colour

[07:18:47.0099] <TabAtkins>
Looks like things are good now, I just did a `make remote` and got whatwg colors

[07:19:04.0495] <TabAtkins>
So it's just a matter of pinging things to rebuild

[07:22:36.0847] <annevk>
Thanks TabAtkins. Trying it out with whatwg/dom.

[07:24:29.0298] <annevk>
And it worked. Hurray.

[12:40:26.0427] <akaster>
Is there somewhere in the spec where the legacy DOM behavior of `document.myForm` access is mentioned?  I know that form elements are supposed to be exposed as named properties on the window (and also globalThis) of the page, but I haven't seen references to that old (Netscape? IE?) Behavior of exposing them on the document as well.

[12:42:29.0092] <akaster>
Oh I'm just blind

[12:42:50.0164] <akaster>
It's right below current script on dom.html

[12:48:12.0930] <akaster>
Named property access on the window, document and forms is just screaming for a cache. The naive "just implement the spec" approach is showing up in profiles on ladybird 🐞 😅

Now getting CSSWG internal server errors... yeah, I think we should resurrect the run-it-ourselves PRs

I've bugged plinss. It was broken yesterday too. 

[16:44:22.0677] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
+1 for getting this onto a server that a whole team is responsible for. It doesn't make sense to rely on 1 person.

[16:56:59.0510] <Jeffrey Yasskin>

[21:59:14.0853] <sideshowbarker>
As far as W3C hosting any replacement for https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/, I think that’s extremely unlikely to happen.

If anybody wants to know why in more detail, I  can explain more. But regardless, even if W3C were to host it, that wouldn’t solve the problem of spreading out the maintenance responsibilities among a wider part of the community — because the way that W3C normally does hosting would necessarily limit shell access to the server environment to W3C staff only (or even specifically just to W3C systems-team staff).

[23:38:02.0478] <annevk>
I think the problem is more that the whole setup is somewhat opaque without any visibility into the code or ways to report issues in a transparent manner. Not that there's no shell access.

[23:52:33.0471] <sideshowbarker>
So maybe rather than trying to   set up community hosting for the existing code that none of us know anything about or have ever actually even seen or contributed anyway, it might be better to build something from scratch based on the requirements

[23:56:25.0139] <annevk>
Yeah, I think for now WHATWG will just install it on GitHub CI per Domenic's work. If at some point a centralized solution exists we feel comfortable with we could switch back to that. Although Domenic's back-of-the-envelope math suggests it might not be worth the effort.

Matrix threads, at least as implemented on app.element.io are terrible. There's always unread notifications and nowhere to find them. The experience is so much worse than Slack. :/

[23:30:06.0330] <sideshowbarker>
_“There's always unread notifications and nowhere to find them”_ — exactly that, yeah.

I often end up just setting the entire room to _”mark read“_, because it’s still showing there unread-messages dot— but even after checking, I can’t find any thread that has unread messages…

[23:35:46.0071] <sideshowbarker>
In general it seems like the UI/UX of app.element.io and the Element desktop app are worse in pretty much every way than Slack and Discord too. Stuff “just works” in the Slack and Discord UIs, but in Element makes even the simple things difficult.

Before I had hoped that Element UI/UX would eventually get better but it’s been this bad for so long now that at this point it seems pretty clear it’s never going to really improve significantly

I wish there were a way to disable threads for a room

[00:10:43.0769] <annevk>
I think I found what you have to do to get rid of the dot. Next to the (i) in the top right corner there's a threads button. But all the threads in there have a dot as well, despite having gone through those at least once in the past. I suspect it simply doesn't remember across sessions or some such. It's just bad.

I have a question about the term resource. Is it referring to a variable name or a function name? And why do we have to write it in two different ways, one normal and one italicized? I could not find the  formating rule behind it

[02:21:52.0075] <annevk>
It's a type followed by variable name for the type.

[03:39:57.0326] <zcorpan>
If it was a JS template string instead, it would be:
`an optional ${type} <var>${parameter}</var> (default ${defaultValue})`

and the example below has for the navigationType param:

type="boolean"
parameter="exceptionsEnabled"
defaultValue="false"

[08:45:39.0587] <chargeitall>
is there a link that defines the type resource? with examples?

real examples of algorithms that use the “resource” type,


2024-01-16
[00:51:16.0400] <freddy>
I think this bit in infra is an example. But I found `media resource` in https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#media-resource and fetch uses the term "resource" a lot for something that is supposed to be fetched. But it doesn't seem to be defined or used in an algorithm there.

keithamus: how do I get diff of diffs in github? I mean there is some older version of a pr and new one and I'd like to know what has changed

[07:01:48.0080] <smaug>
(oh, and reviewing HTML spec prs is now really hard with darkmode)

[07:09:12.0546] <keithamus>
If you scroll through the timeline items it should show you the diff range. If someone has force pushed it’ll give you a link so the commit ranges. There should also be a “view changes” button in the timeline that’s personalised to you, to the last time you viewed the diff 

[07:09:30.0468] <keithamus>
What makes dark mode difficult?

[11:33:06.0613] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
There's a 'mark as read' button in the room's ... menu. It took me so long to find it, after all the threads got spontaneously marked as unread.

[11:35:09.0216] <Jeffrey Yasskin>
I believe "resource" comes from https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#resources

Ooh, looks like I missed a few colors, that's on me. I'll file a PR later this week.

Even after doing that thing with the threads button, you can still end up with Element showing that you have unread messages. My element’s been that way for a long time.

The only thing which does actually work in that case is to do what Jeffrey said and just use the 'mark as read' button.

This is apparently a known issue — see https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/issues/24392 (raised nearly a year ago…).

And unfortunately, there’s no option to completely disable threads in Element — see https://github.com/element-hq/element-meta/issues/1090.

Per comments in that issue, the Element product team has intentionally chosen not to provide any such disable-threads option — despite the stuck-notifications bug. And given their track record on fixing bugs, it’s very unlikely they’re going to get the stuck-notifications bug fixed any time soon.

You can propose a breakout session by going to https://github.com/w3c/breakouts-day-2024/issues/new/choose to create a session proposal — though per https://github.com/w3c/breakouts-day-2024/#who-can-propose-a-session you need to be participant in a W3C group to do that.

We should just have a bot that kicks anyone who replies in thread

[13:36:53.0052] <bakkot>
annevk or whoever: do you know why Fetch provides `.arrayBuffer` instead of `.uint8Array`? various other places generally prefer vending `Uint8Array`, and I found https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1724#issuecomment-1814626681 which says that "We decided that we'd use Uint8Array generally for byte buffer representation."

[13:37:14.0116] <bakkot>
maybe it's just that the `arrayBuffer` method predates the more general tendency to prefer `Uint8Array`?

[14:17:47.0657] <Alan Stearns>
Arthur Hemery (and Camille Lamy): what do you think about proposing a “Breakouts Day” session on your proposal for https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6364? It might be a way to get some more webkit/gecko input and make some progress. See sideshowbarker’s post above about the breakouts day.

[21:30:37.0634] <Domenic>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> maybe it's just that the `arrayBuffer` method predates the more general tendency to prefer `Uint8Array`?

I think this is likely.

[21:40:27.0733] <bakkot>
Figure there's any appetite for adding a `.bytes()` method to get a Uint8Array? It feels a bit unnecessary given that you can just do `new Uint8Array(await body.arrayBuffer())`, but it would be more consistent in allowing people to never think about ArrayBuffers

[21:56:01.0756] <Domenic>
I think so. Seems uncontroversial, but also the kind of thing that would benefit from someone being willing to submit patches since it's not exactly fitting into any team's quarterly goals.

[23:45:05.0730] <annevk>
bakkot: that seems reasonable. We'd have to add it to some other APIs too that copied Fetch. And maybe we should annotate `arrayBuffer()` somehow so it doesn't get copied further.

[23:59:40.0770] <bakkot>
a quick glance through https://dontcallmedom.github.io/webidlpedia/names/ArrayBuffer.html suggests it has been copied only to PushMessageData and Blob, which isn't too bad so far

[00:00:10.0543] <annevk>
Yeah, that sounds about right.

[00:00:23.0515] <bakkot>
FileReader also has `readAsArrayBuffer` which is a bit odd

[00:00:58.0491] <annevk>
Right, we don't have to care about updating FileReader though. It's kinda like XHR (which also has responseType = "arrayBuffer" come to think of it).

[00:01:43.0926] <bakkot>
huh, wonder why that doesn't show up on the WebIDLpedia page

[00:01:47.0320] <bakkot>
anyway yeah

[00:02:04.0920] <annevk>
Probably because it's an enum value?

[00:02:19.0083] <annevk>
 * Right, we don't have to care about updating FileReader though. It's kinda like XHR (which also has responseType = "arraybuffer" come to think of it).

[00:02:42.0245] <bakkot>
I'd expect it to show up in the algorithm, though. maybe the enum value gets threaded through to Fetch?

[00:03:07.0458] <bakkot>
anyway, if "things which vend bytes should vend Uint8Arrays specifically, not ArrayBuffer" is indeed a general principle to follow, might also be worth documenting in the design principles?

[00:14:36.0207] <annevk>
bakkot: XHR has responseType (takes an enum) and response (which returns the type corresponding to the enum)

[00:21:12.0736] <bakkot>
hmm, https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#the-response-attribute does refer to "a new ArrayBuffer object", and ArrayBuffer links; not sure why WebIDLpedia wouldn't pick up on it. 

[00:21:18.0122] <bakkot>
possibly because of https://github.com/whatwg/xhr/issues/376 I guess

[00:21:25.0286] <bakkot>
anyway, not super important

Domenic: I was looking at https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/21041 again and I think they match implementations, but not the spec. The spec grabs the document when calling parseFromString(). But implementations (and the tests) assume it's grabbed as part of the DOMParser invocation.

[23:31:39.0680] <annevk>
Domenic: I prototype'd the spec in https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/22971 and got a number of test failures.

[23:33:17.0835] <annevk>
There's also some differences across implementations from code inspection. Only Gecko seems to carry over the base URL. And Gecko caches the URL when DOMParser is constructed. So pushState() doesn't impact it. (This fails some tests, though a design like that might be simpler in certain ways.)

[23:34:04.0292] <Domenic>
Hmm, good catch. Strange that I added tests specifically for this sort of multi-global madness but didn't match the spec when doing so.

[23:44:28.0933] <Domenic>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> Domenic: I was looking at https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/21041 again and I think they match implementations, but not the spec. The spec grabs the document when calling parseFromString(). But implementations (and the tests) assume it's grabbed as part of the DOMParser invocation.

Wait, no, I think the tests match the spec. "this's relevant global object's associated Document" is equivalent to the global at the time `new DOMParser()` was called; `new DOMParser()` creates `this`.

[23:44:46.0084] <Domenic>
Your patch prototypes using the current global object's associated Document, which is not what the spec says.

[23:49:24.0454] <annevk>
Domenic: interesting, thanks! So whenever we use relevant I guess we implicitly require the implementation to store a reference in the constructor. I guess that makes sense.

[23:52:52.0271] <Domenic>
Yeah, I kind of thought all implementations already did that? Web IDL certainly assumes it.

[23:53:02.0741] <Domenic>
At least a reference to the global, from which you can get the document

[23:54:14.0732] <annevk>
Domenic: It looks to be manual in all three implementations. Chromium and WebKit even use a WeakPtr which worries me a little bit, but it's hard to force GC in tests so not sure if my concerns are well-founded.

[23:55:32.0053] <Domenic>
Hmm yeah, in Chromium there's a variety of easy utility classes and templates you can inherit from I guess, but that makes sense.

[23:55:48.0806] <annevk>
Or maybe there's just some leftover code in DOMParser that's redundant with more recent IDL developments?

I see that https://github.com/WICG/identity-credential/blob/main/digital-credentials-2-proposal.md (frontend web-platform API for “Digital Credentials”) seems to have gotten some implementor interest.

I don’t really know much of anything about credentials/identity stuff, except some incidental awareness of the W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) stuff — and only then, because the groups working on those things are at the W3C.

So is the implementor interest in WICG Digital Credentials also an indicator that implementors now see W3C Verifiable Credentials (and maybe DID also) as something actually possibly relevant for the web platform?

I’ve gleaned that W3C Verifiable Credentials are just one possible data format for Verifiable Credentials — and the WICG Digital Credentials draft cites a protocol spec at https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html which mentions W3C VC but also an “ISO mdoc” data format that seems to be for basically the same thing.

Anyway, I’m basically just wondering whether there’s now actually enough browser-implementor interest in this stuff — in integrating it into the web platform through frontend APIs — that I should actually start paying attention to any of it.

How come https://url.spec.whatwg.org/ isn't WHATWG green?

Refresh? There was a CI issue earlier

Doesn't help. I guess there's a sticky cache somewhere.

I was seeing green from my own cache. Probably the build step needs to run again

Yeah, Domenic and I should deploy some spec-factory changes. But also, turns out i18n-glossary is at it again squatting on UTF-8 making it impossible to build the URL Standard: https://github.com/w3c/i18n-glossary/issues/66 :/

I had missed that Gecko now passes most URL tests. Nice work!
