annevk: right, what is the next step? It's still doesn't touch the **custom element reactions stack**

[23:58:58.0165] <annevk>
Oh, I was confusing it with the queue. I think the stack is being used when for instance a custom element is being constructed and its constructor uses a thing with CEReactions.

We often check for detached documents by checking if some relevant global object "is a Window" and that it's associated doc is fully active. Is there is an equivalent we need to do for workers/other globals?

[08:24:16.0682] <Dominic Farolino>
Can workers ever become "detached" or "inactive" in the same way that requires this checking?

[08:25:38.0952] <Dominic Farolino>
I'm writing a spec for an interface that is being introduced to Window and Workers, but I have a bunch of "relevant global object's active Document is fully active" checks. But that's obviously insufficient for Workers, so I'm trying to figure out if I need a similar check for those environments or not

[08:49:43.0094] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: I think in theory a worker can be bfcache'd and then it'd prolly apply, but that's poorly defined

+1 that it would be lovely for org admins and moderators to be able to see an org-wide view of reported content. Then folks wouldn't need to know to forward spam to keithamus; they could just use Github's reporting API.

Should Infra have any advice on how specs should use exceptions? https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#algorithm-control-flow says algorithms can throw, and the exception will silently propagate up the stack, but I feel like it's a best practice to at least mention which algorithms can throw.

I want to propose allowing `blocking=render` on inline scripts, would that be a "new feature" or a "new issue"?

Noam Rosenthal: I guess up to you which template you want

Hmm ok thanks.

annevk: well, you confirm my suggestions about API that decorated by CEReactions that can create an element and invoke constructor method with another API decorated by CEReations. Thanks.
