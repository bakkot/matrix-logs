I would strongly support that; it seems like a good fit...

annevk, Domenic : Do you happen to know the history of why step 1 "Map under section 4 "Processing" in UTS 46 leaves disallowed characters in place and they are only checked in step 4 "Convert/Validate"? https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#Processing

PR Preview is now saying `Error: 405 Method Not Allowed: Must use POST to process URL` at https://github.com/whatwg/websockets/pull/48

I retried a few times.

keithamus: The wpt Interop  team has an issue with a new GitHub account seemingly beeing detected as a spam account (because we made a script to comment on a 100+ issues).  Is it easy to unblock the account?

[09:50:33.0969] <zcorpan>
`wpt-interop`

[09:57:46.0178] <keithamus>
Sure. Is that the name of the bot? Iâ€™ll get it handled 

[10:05:01.0476] <zcorpan>
keithamus: Thanks! We've started posted manually, so maybe we get some duplicates, but we can remove dup comments. Should it work to run the script for all issues now?

[10:07:08.0190] <keithamus>
Okay zcorpan that user has been restored and marked as `hammy` which hopefully means it wonâ€™t get flagged for that kind of activity again ðŸ˜‰

[10:07:39.0141] <zcorpan>
keithamus: TY!

[11:04:04.0039] <keithamus>
Yeah it shouldnâ€™t get flagged for being overly active now

Working on implementing a webidl parser in Zig. Looks like this is a good place to ask questions.

Yes, this is a reasonable spot for questions about the spec.

mfreed: I think it would be nice if you or we together drafted a small blog post around the shadow tree changes
