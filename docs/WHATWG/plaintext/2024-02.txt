I would strongly support that; it seems like a good fit...

annevk, Domenic : Do you happen to know the history of why step 1 "Map under section 4 "Processing" in UTS 46 leaves disallowed characters in place and they are only checked in step 4 "Convert/Validate"? https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#Processing

PR Preview is now saying `Error: 405 Method Not Allowed: Must use POST to process URL` at https://github.com/whatwg/websockets/pull/48

I retried a few times.

keithamus: The wpt Interop  team has an issue with a new GitHub account seemingly beeing detected as a spam account (because we made a script to comment on a 100+ issues).  Is it easy to unblock the account?

[09:50:33.0969] <zcorpan>
`wpt-interop`

[09:57:46.0178] <keithamus>
Sure. Is that the name of the bot? Iâ€™ll get it handled 

[10:05:01.0476] <zcorpan>
keithamus: Thanks! We've started posted manually, so maybe we get some duplicates, but we can remove dup comments. Should it work to run the script for all issues now?

[10:07:08.0190] <keithamus>
Okay zcorpan that user has been restored and marked as `hammy` which hopefully means it wonâ€™t get flagged for that kind of activity again ðŸ˜‰

[10:07:39.0141] <zcorpan>
keithamus: TY!

[11:04:04.0039] <keithamus>
Yeah it shouldnâ€™t get flagged for being overly active now

Working on implementing a webidl parser in Zig. Looks like this is a good place to ask questions.

Yes, this is a reasonable spot for questions about the spec.

mfreed: I think it would be nice if you or we together drafted a small blog post around the shadow tree changes

Regarding trailing (not leading) characters in floating-point number values: Does the parsing algorithm at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#rules-for-parsing-floating-point-number-values require implementations to ignore all trailing characters that are not ASCII digits?

[00:35:21.0240] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: yeah, it ends up ignoring essentially everything at a certain point. Whereas before that it is quite strict.

[00:36:00.0858] <sideshowbarker>
OK, thanks

[00:37:18.0064] <sideshowbarker>
That complicates dealing with U+000Bâ€¦ Implementation-wise, it would be easier to just reject it everywhere

[00:46:33.0257] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: I left a comment on your implementation. You need to go deeper. :-)

[00:47:41.0550] <annevk>
The source of the problem is WebKit's (copied by Chromium) string to double operations. They do a bit too much.

Yeah, Iâ€™m discovering that nowâ€¦

[00:52:02.0089] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: It might be a bit much though so not handling U+000B for now would be reasonable too.

[00:52:29.0143] <sideshowbarker>
OK

[00:53:36.0470] <annevk>
Ideally string to double would just do the minimal thing. It would progress some character pointer and return failure or a number. And then after that the caller gets to decide whether to ignore trailing characters or not.

[00:54:04.0471] <annevk>
And the caller also gets to decide where the character pointer starts (i.e., whether to skip whitespace and what type of whitespace beforehand).
