Alexander Kalenik: Did you have a chance to look at https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9148#issuecomment-1610989949 ? I would love to get your implementer experience-informed opinion, before I go making changes.

Google Workspace uses it heavily to hint for process isolation among its many same-site cross-origin pages.

Domenic: ok. Do you know if there's interest from non-Google properties?

[00:57:26.0556] <Domenic>
I haven't been in touch with any. Unfortunately it looks like it's not used on the sites HTTP archive picks up, but it's used by ~0.5% of page views. https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/3286

Domenic: ok, thanks!
