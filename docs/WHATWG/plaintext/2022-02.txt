anyone know if we ever defined what headers should not be included in subsequent requests after a cross-origin HTTP redirect?

[14:59:15.0612] <Domenic>
> <@hixie:matrix.org> anyone know if we ever defined what headers should not be included in subsequent requests after a cross-origin HTTP redirect?

I see nothing relevant in https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-redirect-fetch . This might fall into the still-underspecified https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#:~:text=Modify%20httpRequest%E2%80%99s%20header%20list%20per%20HTTP.

[15:27:35.0811] <Ian Hickson>
yeah i couldn't find anything either

[15:28:32.0358] <Ian Hickson>
context is we're trying to figure out how the Dart HttpClient should be updated, but so far it seems the list of headers to skip is just something we copy from Curl or Chrome...

What’s the current best-practice way to programmatically detect if a document is in a frame?

[04:24:40.0876] <Noam Rosenthal>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> What’s the current best-practice way to programmatically detect if a document is in a frame?

I guess https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/frameElement ?

[04:52:55.0574] <Noam Rosenthal>
(I usually do something like `window.parent !== window.self` but `frameElement` feels more like a best practice)

[06:23:59.0236] <sideshowbarker>
Noam Rosenthal: thanks much

> <@hixie:matrix.org> anyone know if we ever defined what headers should not be included in subsequent requests after a cross-origin HTTP redirect?

Not sure how I missed this yesterday but a coworker pointed me to https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-redirect-fetch step 11. So basically remove https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#request-body-header-name

[08:51:47.0062] <smaug>
jgraham: in wpt, is there a way to test behavior when alert() pops up?

[08:51:55.0421] <smaug>
or basically, is there a way to close it?

[09:31:48.0426] <Noam Rosenthal>
smaug: seems like WebDriver has support for this, but it's not patched through to testdriver and not used in tests. Shouldn't be difficult to accomplish IMO. But maybe jgraham has more context (or others at #wpt:matrix.org)

[11:07:30.0365] <Ian Hickson>

oh interesting. but that doesn't include things like Set-Cookie and Authorization?

[11:08:10.0127] <Domenic>
Right so removing credentials is conditional on your credentials mode being "same-origin", let's find that...

[11:09:10.0189] <Domenic>
Those two are only conditionally included in step 20 of https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-http-network-or-cache-fetch based on several pieces of input

[11:46:08.0641] <jgraham>
smaug, Noam Rosenthal I think the way that the wpt harness uses WebDriver makes it quite hard to test alert behaviour; that probabaly requires WebDriver-BiDi

[12:01:35.0565] <Ian Hickson>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Those two are only conditionally included in step 20 of https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-http-network-or-cache-fetch based on several pieces of input

i might just be rusty in my spec-fu but i have to say i can't really figure out how to point someone to this spec in a sufficiently clear way to explain what headers they should include when :-(
like, https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2018-1000007.html removes Authorization during a redirect, but is that all we should remove?

[13:20:56.0091] <Domenic>
I mean the intention isn't just to give people answers to "what HTTP headers to remove during a redirect", it's to give "if you want to build a browser-compatible fetch algorithm here is step-by-step how to do it"

[13:21:11.0063] <Domenic>
And so in particular part of that is only adding in Authorization or Set-Cookie under certain conditions

[13:21:55.0237] <Domenic>
Whether that particular algorithm is applicable to non-browser software, yeah, unclear.

[13:41:03.0547] <Cory>
right place to ask a spec question/comment? this is about selecting and copying arbitrary text from an html page. 

often, content and styling makes sense for the screen, but doesn't translate when pasted as plain-text.

as an example, if i copy those room notifications immediately above ===^ it will paste the text "Today" instead of a timestamp.

the img tag has the alt attribute which (among other things) provides a text representation for the clipboard -- has there ever been any discussion around expanding that to a global element attribute? or providing a mechanism for helping the browser convert an arbitrary selection on the page to plain text (without having to use js)?

[13:43:16.0151] <Andreu Botella>
something that doesn't require JS, I don't know, but you can customize what gets copied into the clipboard with the clipboard API

[13:43:19.0234] <Andreu Botella>
https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis

[13:51:00.0550] <Cory>
that's great for specialized situations but creating something that allows arbitrary selections would be difficult.  ...and i guess expanding alt to non-images would be difficult for the same reasons, like partial selections.  i donno. copying/pasting text from pages sucks though, ha

yea this is not for cross-origin

[22:58:53.0464] <sideshowbarker>
yeah I thought it _never_ worked cross-origin — but then I found for the case of the iframe at the end of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API/Using_the_Notifications_API#replacing_existing_notifications it did actually seem to work

[22:59:03.0906] <sideshowbarker>
but maybe I was just testing it wrong

[22:59:41.0476] <sideshowbarker>
anyway, reverting to just the usual `window.self !== window.top`

or “top top” for short

[00:07:10.0484] <annevk>
`frameElement` can only work cross-origin when `document.domain` is involved and the documents are same-site. If you find it does something in other cases I'd love to see a testcase.

Yes, I'm keeping a close eye on that. It seems so far it'll just be an auxiliary BC with some flag on it... not as intrusive on other parts of the stack like browsing context groups / navigation. Although, like prerendering, they will need a lot of API restrictions. (Unlike prerendering, theirs will be simpler as they can just deny stuff, there's no transition-to-a-real-BC phase.) https://github.com/steimelchrome/document-pip-explainer/issues/1

[07:53:54.0160] <architect88>
Hello everyone. I'm working on my first template and can't figure out the nuances of semantic markup (in automatic key). 
I apologize if some of the questions are inappropriate.

The first question is about the <aside> tag. How correct is it to place the all sidebar zone in it? because the content of the sidebar can contain a variety of elements, such as widgets, navigation elements, search filters, ad units, etc.

The second question is about the <header> tag.
Here is an example, how correct is it?
```
<header>logotype \ navigation</header>
<nav>breadcrumbs</nav>
<main>
<article>
<header> <h1>Article title</h1></header>
article content
</article>
</main>
```

maybe it's better to move the <h1> from the <article> or from the <artcile> and <main>,  like this?
```
<header>logotype \ navigation</header>
<nav>breadcrumbs</nav>
<header> <h1>Article title</h1></header>
<main>
<article>
article content
</article>
</main>
```

which design is more correct or is it better to do it in a completely different way? 

[07:57:54.0427] <annevk>
Domenic: there's another question as to whether it should count as auxiliary or nested from a privacy perspective

[07:58:18.0816] <annevk>
Domenic: depends a bit on whether it can show UI and what that UI would end up blaming as the responsible party, too

[08:54:26.0483] <Domenic>
Well I think the idea is for it to not show any UI (like other PiP windows). Which is pretty scary, so, I'm curious what the security folks say...

[09:19:39.0029] <annevk>
Domenic: so all APIs that could/would trigger some kind of user agent dialog would have to be disabled?

[09:20:31.0934] <Domenic>
annevk: yes, I think so. I don't think the team has done the audit to make sure that lines up well with their plans but I filed the issue to tell them such an audit is necessary.

[09:20:39.0263] <npd>
does "PIP" stand for "next generation of annoying pop-up ads that are hard to close"? ;)

[09:20:41.0420] <annevk>
If there's no UI indicating the origin of the PiP I'd think it would have to be fully partitioned

[09:21:16.0596] <annevk>
npd: I had a similar thought

[09:21:32.0614] <npd>
more seriously, I did find the picture-in-picture explainer. and I am scared about abuse

[09:21:32.0922] <Domenic>
> <@npd:mozilla.org> does "PIP" stand for "next generation of annoying pop-up ads that are hard to close"? ;)

I don't think so, unless you can trick a user into pressing play on a video, then pressing the video's PiP button.

[09:22:04.0974] <npd>
well, this isn't just videos any more, it sounds like, and any user gesture can trigger it?

[09:22:37.0947] <Domenic>
Hmm yeah I was under the impression there were more restrictions but maybe that's the case...

[09:23:01.0370] <Domenic>
I guess it closes when the opener closes automatically, that's some slight mitigation...

[09:23:43.0843] <npd>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> I guess it closes when the opener closes automatically, that's some slight mitigation...

for sure, although the lack of UI maybe makes it harder to see which pip came from where and how to make it go away

[09:25:00.0686] <Domenic>
npd: annevk: if you were able to file these issues on the repo I think they'd be much appreciated, especially the privacy/partitioning/user prompts one as the full constraints there aren't obvious to me.

[09:25:05.0438] <Domenic>
I can give it a shot otherwise.

annevk: with the fetch API, if a response has no body — for example, for a 204 response — will `response.body` be null? context: https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/12862#issuecomment-1034609833 

[01:45:20.0312] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: yeah, it would make sense for it to be null in that case

[01:45:31.0156] <annevk>
(and the spec allows for it to return null)

[01:47:48.0659] <sideshowbarker>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> sideshowbarker: yeah, it would make sense for it to be null in that case

OK, thanks — though in the case of the response from https://httpstat.us/204 it does seem to end up being a `ReadableStream` and not null. But maybe that’s due to them sending a 0-byte response? (if that’s actually possible)

[01:48:41.0733] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: that would be a browser bug per spec...

[01:49:00.0944] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: spec special cases a couple of response codes

[01:49:12.0184] <sideshowbarker>
ah

[01:49:20.0973] <sideshowbarker>
/me looks back at the spec

[01:53:19.0898] <sideshowbarker>
hmm I’m not finding anything about special-casing in the spec that would allow an empty response to ever be a `ReadableStream` rather than null

[01:54:03.0040] <Andreu Botella>
https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-null-body-status

[01:54:19.0543] <sideshowbarker>
and even testing with a HEAD request, I still get a `ReadableStream`

[01:54:33.0744] <sideshowbarker>
```js
fetch("https://httpstat.us/200", { method: "HEAD" }).then(response => console.log(response.body))
```

[01:54:52.0936] <sideshowbarker>

fetch("https://httpstat.us/204").then(response => console.log(response.body))
```

[01:55:06.0499] <sideshowbarker>
> <@abotella:igalia.com> https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-null-body-status

thanks, looking now

[01:55:08.0080] <Luca Casonato>
That's a browser bug

[01:55:23.0772] <sideshowbarker>
OK

[01:55:38.0276] <Luca Casonato>
Deno does this correctly: 
```js
/m/s/P/g/denoland ❯❯❯ deno
Deno 1.18.2
exit using ctrl+d or close()
> fetch("https://httpstat.us/200", { method: "HEAD" }).then(response => console.log(response.body))

Promise { <pending> }
> null
> fetch("https://httpstat.us/204").then(response => console.log(response.body))

Promise { <pending> }
> null
```

[02:19:25.0013] <sideshowbarker>
> <@lucacasonato:matrix.org> That's a browser bug

OK, so based on simple testing just now, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome all seem to have this same bug.

[02:19:31.0860] <Luca Casonato>
:D

[02:20:23.0767] <sideshowbarker>
yeah, so I think I probably now need to do a follow-up to the MDN change I made, to indicate that while the spec says it should be null, browsers don’t conform

[02:21:17.0317] <annevk>
So if you do new Response().body it's null in Firefox, but maybe once networking gets involved it gets messed up

[02:21:56.0675] <Luca Casonato>
I thought there was a WPT for this (I remember fixing it in Deno). But that might actually have only covered the `new Response(null, {status: 204})` case

[02:22:20.0624] <annevk>
I'm surprised this isn't tested as well, but I have not paid as close attention to all the streams stuff

[02:23:09.0060] <Luca Casonato>
This is the only related test I can find right now:
```js
test(function() {
  var response = new Response(null, {status: 204});
  assert_equals(response.body, null);
}, "Testing null Response body");
```

[02:23:25.0092] <Luca Casonato>
oh and this:
```js
var nullBodyStatus = [204, 205, 304];
nullBodyStatus.forEach(function(status) {
  test(function() {
    assert_throws_js(TypeError,
      function() { new Response("body", {"status" : status }); },

Oh I’d take one then, if that’s okay. “karwa” on GitHub.

[10:06:30.0985] <mek>
How do reviews work on whatwg specs? Or I guess how do I find out who other than myself has write access to approve PRs to the new FS spec (since I presumably shouldn't approve my own changes, even if they are purely editorial)?

[10:12:49.0973] <annevk>
mek: sorry, I've been meaning to get to it, but huge backlog is huge; maybe Domenic can help out

[10:13:18.0633] <annevk>
mek: one thing I found kinda strange is that the `for=` attribute didn't contain the name of the term, but I didn't really take the time to explore

[10:15:07.0993] <annevk>
At a more meta-level, we don't really have a system and if it turns out to be prohibitive for your spec, we can remove the reviewer requirement; I'd recommend against doing that though, it's usually worth the wait

[10:15:49.0703] <mek>
I'm totally in favor of reviews, the fact that github gives no way to even figure out who can give reviews is mostly annoying...

[10:17:18.0821] <annevk>
mek: right, I think currently it's you and WHATWG admins, but we can add more folks, e.g., inexorabletash and asuth are reviewers for Storage

[11:54:03.0786] <zcorpan>
Domenic: did you consider document conformance rules when reviewing `blocking=render`? It seems to me that it's allowed to have any  value

[12:03:30.0204] <Domenic>
> <@zcorpan_:matrix.org> Domenic: did you consider document conformance rules when reviewing `blocking=render`? It seems to me that it's allowed to have any  value

I think you are right this is not correct. It is constrained to be a space-separated sequence of tokens but I made the wrong assumption that "supported tokens" helped with conformance.

[12:04:04.0699] <Domenic>
"A blocking attribute must have a value that is an unordered set of unique space-separated tokens. " -> "A blocking attribute must have a value that is an unordered set of unique space-separated tokens, each of which is a possible blocking token"?

[14:07:39.0483] <zcorpan>
Domenic: right. Yeah, the proposed text should do it I think

[14:08:23.0586] <zcorpan>

Just had a couple minutes to spare. Added some basic tests here: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/32813

[04:29:06.0426] <miketayl_r>
> Enter the Storage Access API. This API lets third parties request storage access as if they were a first party. This is called “unpartitioning” and it gives browsers and users control over which third parties can maintain state across first-party origins as well as determine which origins they can access that state from.

(from https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/02/improving-the-storage-access-api-in-firefox/) annevk - here "storage" is just cookies, right?

[04:29:40.0899] <miketayl_r>
i thought that was the plan, but it references unpartitioning storage a few times and i'm confused now

[04:32:04.0739] <miketayl_r>
ok, i just saw https://github.com/privacycg/storage-partitioning/issues/9#issuecomment-1035960211, so probably yes "storage" means _only_ cookies in the blog post

[04:38:06.0886] <annevk>
miketayl_r: our current implementation still does storage as well

[04:38:42.0729] <annevk>
miketayl_r: we plan to migrate away from that, but it takes some doing and it might end up shipping later therefore

hi

[12:28:40.0854] <and3co>
As a beginner I experiment with fetch() in chrome console. the command is const req = await fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people/");  on some page it is work on some others doesn't. It is because the cors, I would like to know how a page could enable this cors functionality?

I'm not sure if this is the correct forum for this, but I want to discuss rendering across browsers. I know that different computer systems and devices do things differently, but when I look at the same page on two different browsers on the same computer I should see the same rendering. I remember the old days when every browser "had to be different" but this is 2022. You would think by now that Sir Tim Berners-Lee's original vision would be implemented more concisely than it is. It's OK that the browsers look different in terms of their UI, and that their code is not identical, but it is unacceptable that the way a web page is rendered has to be so different. As an example, I will use one of my web pages. I use Firefox as my primary browser, but Edge came with the OS so I use it for only two purposes: to see what a page I am developing looks like and any searches regarding Windows or Microsoft products such as Office. Otherwise I use Firefox. I invite anyone who chooses to to look at my page in any browser you have and let me know how it compares to Firefox. https://wayneca.neocities.org/WebDesign/TagList.html

WHATWG is a consortium of browser developers at heart, so it would make sense that now they can focus on rendering. Web pages are the product of many web page developers, but they all have one thing in common. They want their pages to look the same no matter what browser you are using. Let me describe the difference between Edge and Firefox as far as my page is concerned. Firefox displays it the way I intended for it to look. Edge enlarges the font so it uses more space, resulting in the bottom of the page going below the bottom of the viewport and causing a vertical scrollbar to appear in the viewport pushing the content to the left and changing the way the page looks. This is on the exact same computer. It should not be doing that. Tahoma 12 point should be Tahoma 12 point in every browser. Smaller screen or lower resolution? OK that's a thing, but when it's the same screen and the same resolution the rendering should be identical.

Since the page I used for an example is a work in progress, I decided that I would discuss here what I am doing with it. It is supposed to be as complete a list as possible of every tag and attribute that has existed in the history of HTML and the W3. I am finding that with the previous versions of the DTD (the SGML based ones through 4.01) it is easy to determine what attributes were given to each element. In the Living Standard version, being removed from the SGML requirement for things to be so specific, the specification is written very differently. It has become difficult to determine exactly which attributes should be listed with a given element, and which attributes from the past are no longer relevant. I am also having difficulty with finding a list of the onEvent attributes (such as onMouseDown) in the HTML 5 specification. Is there a concise list?

[07:09:04.0151] <wayneca>
It also seems like the Global Attributes contain members that are not all useful on every element that has them. Is there a way to differentiate between them as they pertain to a given element?

[07:20:24.0954] <wayneca>
Also, I feel I should make a distinction in what I said in my first post. I am not saying Firefox is right and everyone else is wrong. I'm saying that there needs to be an agreed upon definition of proper rendering that all browsers should adhere to if they want to render web pages correctly. Then all web pages would look the same in every browser no matter what platform or browser the user has. Of course, there are limits, such as different screen size and resolutions. The authors of the web pages would have to ensure that they code the pages in such a way that it accommodates as many users as possible, realizing that there will be some users who simply won't see the page as intended.

[07:31:32.0687] <wayneca>
While this site is still basically offline while I develop the pages, I have made that page available so those that need to or are interested can see my progress. I have also now included my Notes page (https://wayneca.neocities.org/WebDesign/Notes.html) so you can see the remarks I have made concerning the effort. This is also a work in progress as I have just begun this work over the past week.

[07:47:57.0919] <annevk>
wayneca: FWIW, although we do define how HTML maps to CSS in the Rendering section of the HTML Standard, how those CSS rules translate into a picture on your screen is not something the WHATWG works on (W3C's CSS WG does), though many here have some expertise in it. (And some a lot.)

Thanks for your input. I realize that the focus of the WHATWG may not be the same as the W3C, but this is the only forum I know of that has so many browser developers in one place. I am reaching out to the browser developers because this is something that has not really been addressed in the history of the W3 that I know of.

[07:55:43.0810] <Luca Casonato>
All three major browser vendors are members of W3C. How exactly a page is rendered (how flex works, how tables should flow, etc) is all specified by the CSSWG. You can see the members here: https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members.en.php3

[07:56:22.0437] <wayneca>
Also, if it was all so straight-forward as the specification defines it, different browsers would not render the pages so differently. I believe that this can and should be remedied by the browser developers coming together and defining the specifics of what a rendered page should look like.

The problem here is not specifications. They exist. The problem is that there are three different engines with different bugs. If you see rendering differences, then these are bugs in individual engines.

[07:57:49.0073] <Andreu Botella>
I don't know about how things are rendered on your system, but in mine the differences between Firefox and Chrome are because I don't have Tahoma installed in my system, and different browsers use different fallback fonts. So that's also something that you can't expect browsers to agree on.

[07:58:15.0329] <wayneca>
I see. So it's a matter of finding and squashing the bugs.

We have shared test suites to tackle this, but they do not have 100% coverage. And even with 100% perfect coverage, the actual implementation of the specs definitly follows the 80:20 rule. The last 20% of issues is just as hard as the first 80%.

Well, I know that this is why you can specify multiple fonts to fall back on. I haven't done it yet, but that's because I am still trying to get all of the data in. Once that is done I can worry about fallback fonts. That was my thinking. I guess I should remedy that now though.

What would any of you say are the most common sans-serif fonts? Would Monaco be one?

[08:03:10.0818] <wayneca>
 * What would any of you say are the most common sans-serif fonts? Would Monaco be one?

[08:05:08.0503] <wayneca>
I have already specified sans-serif as a family in my font-family property. Is that not enough for a system to use whatever is available on a system that doesn't have Tahoma?

[08:07:43.0192] <Alan Stearns>
That is enough, and the text will render in whatever font the browser chooses.

[08:08:30.0215] <wayneca>
That is what I thought too, but I updated the files to include  Verdana, Arial, Helvetica also.

[08:10:25.0684] <Alan Stearns>
That’s usually not necessary (unless you really have a preference for those fonts). Picking your first desired font, then having a generic family fallback is fine

[08:11:50.0729] <wayneca>
OK. I had thought that was the case, but when Andreu Botella stated that they didn't have Tahoma installed on their computer it made me rethink.

[08:13:55.0819] <Andreu Botella>
Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica are all fonts that come with Windows systems and don't tend to come with, say, Linux

[08:14:18.0883] <Andreu Botella>
there are fonts with the same metrics that might come in Linux systems, but they don't have those names

[08:15:19.0949] <wayneca>
That is why I initially included sans-serif in the family list: font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;

[08:16:14.0789] <wayneca>
I thought I understood that this would allow a system that didn't have Tahoma to fall back on whatever sans-serif font it has.

[08:17:01.0733] <Andreu Botella>
if there are multiple, browsers are free to choose one, and different browsers might choose differently

[08:18:08.0417] <wayneca>
Well, I really don't have the means to see what every sans-serif font looks like, so I try to allow the user to determine their own preference when possible.

Hi, I hope this is a good place for my question. I tried to figure out why only link and script tags support SRI. I had a chat with Eric Lawrence, and he told me that there are some theoretical plans to support it (see https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/#verification-of-html-document-subresources). Does anyone know what the current status of this is? Eric told me that potentially Mike West might have some insights, but maybe also someone else knows anything about it.

[23:32:18.0236] <annevk>
Lorenz: having said that, I'm not sure there's a lot of interest to expand SRI support at this time, but I could be mistaken
