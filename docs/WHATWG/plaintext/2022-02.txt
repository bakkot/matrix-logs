anyone know if we ever defined what headers should not be included in subsequent requests after a cross-origin HTTP redirect?

I see nothing relevant in https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-redirect-fetch . This might fall into the still-underspecified https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#:~:text=Modify%20httpRequest%E2%80%99s%20header%20list%20per%20HTTP.

context is we're trying to figure out how the Dart HttpClient should be updated, but so far it seems the list of headers to skip is just something we copy from Curl or Chrome...
