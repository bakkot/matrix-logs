anyone know if we ever defined what headers should not be included in subsequent requests after a cross-origin HTTP redirect?

[14:59:15.0612] <Domenic>
> <@hixie:matrix.org> anyone know if we ever defined what headers should not be included in subsequent requests after a cross-origin HTTP redirect?

I see nothing relevant in https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-redirect-fetch . This might fall into the still-underspecified https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#:~:text=Modify%20httpRequest%E2%80%99s%20header%20list%20per%20HTTP.

[15:27:35.0811] <Ian Hickson>
yeah i couldn't find anything either

[15:28:32.0358] <Ian Hickson>
context is we're trying to figure out how the Dart HttpClient should be updated, but so far it seems the list of headers to skip is just something we copy from Curl or Chrome...

What’s the current best-practice way to programmatically detect if a document is in a frame?

[04:24:40.0876] <Noam Rosenthal>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> What’s the current best-practice way to programmatically detect if a document is in a frame?

I guess https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/frameElement ?

[04:52:55.0574] <Noam Rosenthal>
(I usually do something like `window.parent !== window.self` but `frameElement` feels more like a best practice)

[06:23:59.0236] <sideshowbarker>
Noam Rosenthal: thanks much

Not sure how I missed this yesterday but a coworker pointed me to https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-redirect-fetch step 11. So basically remove https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#request-body-header-name

[08:51:47.0062] <smaug>
jgraham: in wpt, is there a way to test behavior when alert() pops up?

[08:51:55.0421] <smaug>
or basically, is there a way to close it?

[09:31:48.0426] <Noam Rosenthal>
smaug: seems like WebDriver has support for this, but it's not patched through to testdriver and not used in tests. Shouldn't be difficult to accomplish IMO. But maybe jgraham has more context (or others at #wpt:matrix.org)

oh interesting. but that doesn't include things like Set-Cookie and Authorization?

[11:08:10.0127] <Domenic>
Right so removing credentials is conditional on your credentials mode being "same-origin", let's find that...

[11:09:10.0189] <Domenic>
Those two are only conditionally included in step 20 of https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-http-network-or-cache-fetch based on several pieces of input

[11:46:08.0641] <jgraham>
smaug, Noam Rosenthal I think the way that the wpt harness uses WebDriver makes it quite hard to test alert behaviour; that probabaly requires WebDriver-BiDi

[12:01:35.0565] <Ian Hickson>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Those two are only conditionally included in step 20 of https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-http-network-or-cache-fetch based on several pieces of input

i might just be rusty in my spec-fu but i have to say i can't really figure out how to point someone to this spec in a sufficiently clear way to explain what headers they should include when :-(
like, https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2018-1000007.html removes Authorization during a redirect, but is that all we should remove?

[13:20:56.0091] <Domenic>
I mean the intention isn't just to give people answers to "what HTTP headers to remove during a redirect", it's to give "if you want to build a browser-compatible fetch algorithm here is step-by-step how to do it"

[13:21:11.0063] <Domenic>
And so in particular part of that is only adding in Authorization or Set-Cookie under certain conditions

[13:21:55.0237] <Domenic>
Whether that particular algorithm is applicable to non-browser software, yeah, unclear.

right place to ask a spec question/comment? this is about selecting and copying arbitrary text from an html page. 

often, content and styling makes sense for the screen, but doesn't translate when pasted as plain-text.

as an example, if i copy those room notifications immediately above ===^ it will paste the text "Today" instead of a timestamp.

the img tag has the alt attribute which (among other things) provides a text representation for the clipboard -- has there ever been any discussion around expanding that to a global element attribute? or providing a mechanism for helping the browser convert an arbitrary selection on the page to plain text (without having to use js)?

[13:43:16.0151] <Andreu Botella>
something that doesn't require JS, I don't know, but you can customize what gets copied into the clipboard with the clipboard API

[13:43:19.0234] <Andreu Botella>
https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis

[13:51:00.0550] <Cory>
that's great for specialized situations but creating something that allows arbitrary selections would be difficult.  ...and i guess expanding alt to non-images would be difficult for the same reasons, like partial selections.  i donno. copying/pasting text from pages sucks though, ha

[22:57:57.0352] <Noam Rosenthal>
> <@sideshowbarker:mozilla.org> so I’m now realizing that while that seems to work in some cases of cross-origin iframes, it returns null in others

yea this is not for cross-origin

[22:58:53.0464] <sideshowbarker>
yeah I thought it _never_ worked cross-origin — but then I found for the case of the iframe at the end of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API/Using_the_Notifications_API#replacing_existing_notifications it did actually seem to work

[22:59:03.0906] <sideshowbarker>
but maybe I was just testing it wrong

[22:59:41.0476] <sideshowbarker>
anyway, reverting to just the usual `window.self !== window.top` 

[23:01:12.0292] <sideshowbarker>
oh, cool to see there’s a `.top` TLD now — recursively appropriate…

[23:01:56.0977] <sideshowbarker>
makes for some good fun and confusion for any technical writer who has to document it

kind of a “Who’s on first?” thing

[23:02:35.0945] <sideshowbarker>
“the top top-level domain“

[23:02:53.0312] <sideshowbarker>
or “top top” for short

[00:07:10.0484] <annevk>
`frameElement` can only work cross-origin when `document.domain` is involved and the documents are same-site. If you find it does something in other cases I'd love to see a testcase.

Yes, I'm keeping a close eye on that. It seems so far it'll just be an auxiliary BC with some flag on it... not as intrusive on other parts of the stack like browsing context groups / navigation. Although, like prerendering, they will need a lot of API restrictions. (Unlike prerendering, theirs will be simpler as they can just deny stuff, there's no transition-to-a-real-BC phase.) https://github.com/steimelchrome/document-pip-explainer/issues/1

[07:53:54.0160] <architect88>
Hello everyone. I'm working on my first template and can't figure out the nuances of semantic markup (in automatic key). 
I apologize if some of the questions are inappropriate.

The first question is about the <aside> tag. How correct is it to place the all sidebar zone in it? because the content of the sidebar can contain a variety of elements, such as widgets, navigation elements, search filters, ad units, etc.

The second question is about the <header> tag.
Here is an example, how correct is it?
```
<header>logotype \ navigation</header>
<nav>breadcrumbs</nav>
<main>
<article>
<header> <h1>Article title</h1></header>
article content
</article>
</main>
```

maybe it's better to move the <h1> from the <article> or from the <artcile> and <main>,  like this?
```
<header>logotype \ navigation</header>
<nav>breadcrumbs</nav>
<header> <h1>Article title</h1></header>
<main>
<article>
article content
</article>
</main>
```

which design is more correct or is it better to do it in a completely different way? 

[07:57:54.0427] <annevk>
Domenic: there's another question as to whether it should count as auxiliary or nested from a privacy perspective

[07:58:18.0816] <annevk>
Domenic: depends a bit on whether it can show UI and what that UI would end up blaming as the responsible party, too

[08:54:26.0483] <Domenic>
Well I think the idea is for it to not show any UI (like other PiP windows). Which is pretty scary, so, I'm curious what the security folks say...

[09:19:39.0029] <annevk>
Domenic: so all APIs that could/would trigger some kind of user agent dialog would have to be disabled?

[09:20:31.0934] <Domenic>
annevk: yes, I think so. I don't think the team has done the audit to make sure that lines up well with their plans but I filed the issue to tell them such an audit is necessary.

[09:20:39.0263] <npd>
does "PIP" stand for "next generation of annoying pop-up ads that are hard to close"? ;)

[09:20:41.0420] <annevk>
If there's no UI indicating the origin of the PiP I'd think it would have to be fully partitioned

[09:21:16.0596] <annevk>
npd: I had a similar thought

[09:21:32.0614] <npd>
more seriously, I did find the picture-in-picture explainer. and I am scared about abuse

[09:21:32.0922] <Domenic>
> <@npd:mozilla.org> does "PIP" stand for "next generation of annoying pop-up ads that are hard to close"? ;)

I don't think so, unless you can trick a user into pressing play on a video, then pressing the video's PiP button.

[09:22:04.0974] <npd>
well, this isn't just videos any more, it sounds like, and any user gesture can trigger it?

[09:22:37.0947] <Domenic>
Hmm yeah I was under the impression there were more restrictions but maybe that's the case...

[09:23:01.0370] <Domenic>
I guess it closes when the opener closes automatically, that's some slight mitigation...

[09:23:43.0843] <npd>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> I guess it closes when the opener closes automatically, that's some slight mitigation...

for sure, although the lack of UI maybe makes it harder to see which pip came from where and how to make it go away

[09:25:00.0686] <Domenic>
npd: annevk: if you were able to file these issues on the repo I think they'd be much appreciated, especially the privacy/partitioning/user prompts one as the full constraints there aren't obvious to me.

[09:25:05.0438] <Domenic>
I can give it a shot otherwise.
