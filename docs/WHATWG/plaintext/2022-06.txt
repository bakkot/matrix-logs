For the `elementtiming` content attribute, I haven’t found a PR for adding it to the HTML spec. Don’t we need one?
It’s not adequately specified in https://wicg.github.io/element-timing/#sec-modifications-DOM but from what can be gleaned from that, it seems like it would need to be added to HTML as a new global attribute. Right?

Yes, any HTML global attributes with multi-implementer interest should be specified in HTML. I suspect this is a single-implementer spec?

Hi all! I wish everyone is well! How are you all? 
1. I would like to publicize my GitHub profile here are the ideas implemented in Js. Some ideas I filed, I found it very bad to implement and they didn't have a good concept. In summary, I implemented the following ideas(apis): 'BestReadOnTheWeb', 'MeasuringUserInteractionTimeWithWebsite' - I would to have positive or negative feedback of each idea - if you all wants. Note: Other ideas I've shelved too - because they're bad ideas because they depend on other things and/or ideas to get done. Link: https://github.com/raphaellouisandress - the licenses for each code are MIT.
2. I hope I helped with a few things to make the web better, safer, transparent
3. I feel that after building some of these implementations my help has ended, goodbye folks. Keep up the great work all, I really enjoyed the feedback I got here.

yeah, it's okay to say we have interests informally, however I'd like this standard position issue https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/192 to be resolved first before adding the attribute

[13:43:12.0410] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
annevk: Would https://github.com/annevk/orb block a response for a non-safelisted MIME type, that also came back with `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`? (Should it?)


2022-06-02
[23:39:33.0575] <annevk>
Eric Portis (he/him): it currently does, in https://github.com/annevk/orb/issues/30 I mention it as a possible fast path, but to match its processing model we'd have to track it across redirects

[23:41:18.0547] <annevk>
Eric Portis (he/him): I think if we do it properly (i.e., account for redirects) it's probably reasonable to safelist such responses

[03:33:48.0865] <Ondřej Žára>
Looks like the "Libera" IRC is not the proper whatwg chat place, right?

Yeah, I have no memories about how I got from Freenode to Libera. Whatever.

[03:43:08.0335] <Ondřej Žára>
Let me repaste my original Libera question then

[03:43:15.0874] <Ondřej Žára>
are there any general guidelines regarding "js property <-> HTML attribute" reflection for custom elements?

[03:43:23.0502] <Ondřej Žára>
for instance those interactive components whose properties change quickly (`<my-map lat=... lon=...>`)

[03:43:50.0933] <Ondřej Žára>
I recall people suggesting to use attributes as the source of truth

[03:43:57.0242] <Ondřej Žára>
But that might not hold any more?

[03:52:30.0157] <annevk>
Might be a good question for #web-components:matrix.org though it's not very active. There's definitely no guidelines in the standard. I'd recommend looking at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#reflect and seeing how it might be applicable for a custom element. At least if you want them to behave like built-in elements. Often that does use the attribute as a source of truth, but you could optimize around that a fair bit.

[03:53:31.0279] <Ondřej Žára>
Thanks for the pointers. Will read the spec part a bit, then probably re-ask in that channel.

[06:58:12.0713] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
annevk:  Ok, thanks! This would make the story for third party media hosts that want to upgrade resources without requiring every document that embeds from them to also upgrade, well, livable, I think.

Eric Portis (he/him): I mean in principle ORB shouldn't really impact anyone, though I suppose there might be some perf implications if you don't have your MIME types in order

[07:50:39.0314] <annevk>
Eric Portis (he/him): it might be a reasonable way out however for new image formats and over the long term require something like that for all cross-origin fetches

Noam Rosenthal: Just want to make sure I understand the rationale behind the LargestContentfulPaint spec. So if the image is expanded, we don't report the actual painted size, but rather we report the intrinsic size of the image 

[10:59:14.0669] <sefeng>
is it because we don't want web devs to game the metric?

[11:06:43.0007] <Eric Portis (he/him)>
annevk: “in principle ORB shouldn't really impact anyone”

Half of all <img>s load cross-origin; I’d suspect CSS background-image to have a similar breakdown. My mental model of ORB previously was: in order to adopt new image formats, lots of HTML was going to have to change, and there just wouldn’t be a way to use new image formats across origins in CSS. Big impact! Mitigated by CORP.

[11:08:06.0139] <annevk>
Eric Portis (he/him): I see, new media formats definitely have that wrinkle atm

[11:08:21.0608] <annevk>
Eric Portis (he/him): I'd be okay with this compromise

[11:08:42.0803] <annevk>
Eric Portis (he/him): do you want to put it forward in https://github.com/annevk/orb/issues/3?

[11:09:29.0596] <Eric Portis (he/him)>

> <@sefeng:mozilla.org> Noam Rosenthal: Just want to make sure I understand the rationale behind the LargestContentfulPaint spec. So if the image is expanded, we don't report the actual painted size, but rather we report the intrinsic size of the image 

That’s the basic idea. We don’t want an enormously scaled 1x1 image to be considered “largest”

[11:18:42.0767] <sefeng>
Noam Rosenthal: I see, I start to understand the penalty factor thing..but if a scaled 1x1 image is the largest, what's wrong of reporting it..?

[11:30:54.0985] <Noam Rosenthal>
It’s ok but you don’t want to report it as 1000x1000

[11:43:16.0228] <sefeng>

[01:58:43.0097] <Noam Rosenthal>

It is a heuristic to make higher quality images count as larger than upscaled ones. that metric can be gamed in so many other ways though IMO. Yoav Weiss probably has more context on LCP than myself ☺️

> <@noamr:matrix.org> It is a heuristic to make higher quality images count as larger than upscaled ones. that metric can be gamed in so many other ways though IMO. Yoav Weiss probably has more context on LCP than myself ☺️

Think of the placeholder use case, when an image element shows a low-quality upscaled image and then loads the full-res image later. The full-res image would be considered larger for purposes of LCP than the placeholder

Yoav Weiss: looking at https://www.w3.org/TR/largest-contentful-paint/ I see it still shows https://wicg.github.io/largest-contentful-paint as the ED URL — where instead it should be https://w3c.github.io/largest-contentful-paint/ (which the wicg URL redirects to).
Should I go ahead and raise a PR with a patch?

[02:14:42.0167] <sideshowbarker>
hmm I see the source at https://github.com/w3c/largest-contentful-paint/blob/4a0930ca74a98941237635424cd34c8a44825b2d/index.bs#L10 does already have the w3c URL

Can you re-build and re-publish that to https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/WD-largest-contentful-paint-20220524/ ?

Hi

[08:32:20.0816] <Domenic>
Yes

[08:32:37.0148] <smaug>
The paragraphs below seem to hint that value and max content attributes should be parsed.. so leading whitespace is removed

[08:32:40.0512] <smaug>
ok

[08:33:15.0809] <smaug>
(browsers aren't consistent with this)

Does anyone understand why https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Char is actually "any Unicode character, excluding the surrogate blocks, FFFE, and FFFF"? Seems like, e.g., U+0000 NULL is excluded?


2022-06-07
[22:11:18.0981] <annevk>
Domenic: excluding control code points is quite typical

[22:12:00.0645] <Domenic>
But this infects the [^] syntax it appears: https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-notation

[22:12:47.0106] <Domenic>
As well as just the [] syntax in general

[22:12:56.0430] <Domenic>
So it looks like XML-defined EBNF is just not really usable?

[22:13:53.0258] <annevk>
Oh great, I didn't realize that ☹️

[22:15:12.0854] <Domenic>
How do we feel about JS-compatible RegExps... The other main alternative is to just write a parser algorithm

[08:38:46.0964] <Noam Rosenthal>

[08:39:51.0603] <Domenic>

[08:40:57.0953] <Noam Rosenthal>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> I really wish someone would write a Bikeshed source code formatter we could use, ideally mostly compatible with existing conventions to not mess up blame too much

Is there an open issue for what's required? I can fiddle with it. I know a bit of Rust

[08:58:57.0758] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: so I'm not sure what's happening with the review-resolve cycle but I'm finding the same issues as Yutaka it seems, e.g., timing global seemingly having an unaccounted null value; except this specific Yutaka issue was marked as resolved (whereas some others were not but do appear addressed)

[09:00:13.0616] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: as for the formatter, essentially something that takes a WHATWG-style `*.bs` file, parses it, and then serializes it according to the rough formatting guidelines in `README.md`

[09:00:31.0877] <annevk>
Domenic might have more informed thoughts 🙂

[09:01:23.0692] <Domenic>
Yeah, no open issue. It's hard because parsing/serializing bs (or Wattsi-style HTML) is not an identity function.

[09:01:27.0473] <annevk>
I guess Yutaka also r+'d it and there was no forced rebase so hmm

[09:02:49.0302] <Domenic>
Another problem with HTML formatters is that it's hard to know what whitespace is significant. E.g. HTML Tidy often creates `foo.\n</p>` which is undesirable by our standards.

[09:03:33.0299] <Domenic>
But like `<li>\n<p>` is technically different than `<li><p>`
 (different DOM structure, with a text node in the middle for the former) but we consider them both OK

That comment was resolved with a reply, ‘timingGlobal’ is null in the case of early hints, I will look at it again though to make sure 

[09:05:23.0960] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: as written fetch's _timingGlobal_ argument is either "client" or a global object afaict (though the usage side suggests "none" can be valid and the algorithm suggests null can be valid)

Ok, I will revise it and the usage to state null should be valid

[09:07:09.0865] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: to be clear I think it would be better if you made that "none" for consistency with "client"

[09:07:40.0022] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: if we're doing enum or object let's not also add null to the possible types

[09:07:55.0656] <Noam Rosenthal>

Done, thanks. Working on PotentialCustomElementName now.

[09:21:46.0445] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: fixed comments. re. request vs. fetch: the idea is that all timing-related things are associated with fetch and not with a request. So if the request is forwarded by a service worker the timing info, initiiator and reporting global relate to the service worker and not to the original fetcher

[09:23:27.0067] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: does that mean we need to change the fetch params when we hand it over to the SW?

[09:24:00.0658] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: no need. new fetch params are created when the SW calls `fetch()`

[09:24:47.0796] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: well yes, if it does that, but that's also the case for bits on request so I'm not sure how that's an argument for this setup

[09:26:38.0550] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: you mean the TAO bit etc.? I think they should also move to fetch-params

[09:26:53.0215] <Noam Rosenthal>
also those are a bit different because they're not passed from the outside

[09:28:50.0213] <Noam Rosenthal>
To me it seems cleaner if the request was something somewhat immutable and transient that kind of matches with the `Request` object, and doesn't need to be "reset" when forwarded by the SW. In the case of timing though, it currently doesn't really have any observable difference 

[09:31:35.0017] <Noam Rosenthal>
currently we keep bumping into these issues of ambiguity between request and fetch-params, I'm hoping that by making request somewhat immutable & transient we can avoid them, but maybe it's hard to accomplish because of thing's like request's client

[09:34:47.0271] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: but if you think it's preferable to make `timingGlobal`& `initiator` request-associated I could go with it, it keeps the current separation of fetch taking a request + callbacks as parameters

[09:52:21.0972] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: so to me the string field seems very similar to "destination" (and should probably be an enum like it)

[09:52:41.0235] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: and longer term we want to figure out how they relate going forward

[09:53:21.0860] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I'm less sure about the other fields and I do like the idea of moving some stuff out of request as it's quite overloaded

[10:03:14.0968] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: ok, I will move both to being request-associated. Maybe changing it to an enum is more involved though for this patch, an initiator type could potentially be any element name

[10:03:50.0597] <annevk>
I see, yeah, please file a follow-up?

[10:03:53.0771] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: I forget, in the case of iframes, is request's client the container or the reserved environment of the iframe? If it's the former I can probably do away with `timingGlobal`

[10:05:00.0390] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: hmm, that's a very good question; I'm not sure

[10:05:20.0886] <Noam Rosenthal>
(the code in HTML for that is a bit hard to follow)

[10:05:46.0912] <annevk>
For the initial request you kinda need both I think, but I'm not sure what is written down and whether that maps to what implementations do

[10:06:17.0940] <annevk>
As in, you need the parent for referrer thingies, but you don't want the parent for SW selection, say

[10:14:25.0143] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: yea both are passed, and the client is the container. https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#process-a-navigate-fetch

[10:14:29.0262] <Noam Rosenthal>
(2)

[10:15:39.0225] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: it means that I can do away with `timingGlobal` - it's always `client`, and in the early hints case request's `client` is a reserved environment which doesn't have a global object, I can infer that instead of pass it from outside

[10:16:26.0093] <Noam Rosenthal>
for the cases where there are no reporting (e.g. cross-origin style subresources) initiatorType can be null or `do not report` etc

[11:21:32.0479] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: done, though currently fetch doesn't build due to some biblio thing?

[11:57:46.0155] <sefeng>
Yoav Weiss: For this test https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/largest-contentful-paint/initially-invisible-images.html, wouldn't you expect an `green-1x1.png` entry first and then the `yellow.png` one? 

[12:22:00.0511] <Yoav Weiss>
@sefeng: According to the spec, I think you're right and that's what I'd expect, because "potentially add an LCP entry" is called after the image is loaded 

[12:26:08.0907] <sefeng>
Okay, yeah, that assertion is going to fail for non “yellow” images, I’ll make some changes to the test

[12:27:33.0505] <Yoav Weiss>
Thanks!

Why does https://wicg.github.io/background-fetch/#header-syntax and https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#simple-range-header-value only handle a subset of RFC 7233?

[18:34:26.0963] <dlrobertson>
Opened https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1450 before I realized background fetch didn't handle the `suffix-byte-range-spec`

[18:35:54.0243] <dlrobertson>
I didn't really have a strong reason for opening the issue... I was mostly just curious

[00:27:55.0825] <annevk>
dlrobertson: Jake Archibald hopefully remembers

[05:21:59.0562] <dlrobertson>
I'll look at the commit message PR thread... maybe there will be useful info there as well

[05:45:33.0713] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: Fetch build isn't passing because a few RFCs were merged into `HTTP-SEMANTICS`, I posted a fix: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/1451

[05:55:19.0482] <annevk>
dlrobertson: if there's nothing there I'd be inclined to treat this as a bug; it's definitely a problem that we don't call it out in a note or some such

[05:55:52.0425] <annevk>
dlrobertson: I also thought that instead of "simple" we could use "single" or "single-range" to describe the semantics more clearly once we adjust this

[05:55:56.0649] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: thanks!

Ah! I like that

[05:56:57.0532] <dlrobertson>
I'd seen your note about renaming that, but hadn't thought of anything

[05:59:33.0531] <annevk>
Noam Rosenthal: I'm going to take that PR and adjust it a bit, I think that'll be quicker than review

About the new static Response.json() which can't be documented in MDN/BCD yet: https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/16613

[23:56:41.0385] <Ms2ger 💉💉>
Oops

[23:58:44.0810] <sideshowbarker>
_“hope this doesn't happen much”_ indeed

[00:01:38.0602] <sideshowbarker>
foolip: Another possible option is to make a subfeature of `api.Response.json` named `"static"` — which is ugly and backwards but at least we wouldn’t need a separate filename or new subdirectory (and no mass updates of existing data)

[00:01:50.0201] <annevk>
foolip: perhaps you could do something like api.Response$statics.json, but stuffing prototype in all of the existing members would be correct

[00:02:27.0804] <sideshowbarker>

[00:04:50.0457] <foolip>
It would solve the problem, and would have the benefit that it tells BCD consumers what's static and what's not, but it would be a big change. It's notable that it's not done even for the javascript.* data, even though .prototype. is in the page titles (but not URLs) there, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/groupByToMap for example.

[00:09:52.0911] <sideshowbarker>
yeah in hindsight I guess it all should have been done that way from the beginning but at the point is seems like the correcting it globally would maybe be a case of the cure being worse than the disease

[00:15:38.0059] <sideshowbarker>
As far as my `"static"` subfeature hack, one side effect of it is that the current tooling would cause the compat data for the static method to show up in the BCD table for the instance method at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json#browser\_compatibility as an additional subfeature.

We wouldn’t want that of course — but I know the code for generating the BCD tables very well, and it would be easy to add some special-handling to it to cause it ignore any case of `"static"` as a subfeature but not ignore it when it’s called directly as a feature — that is, ignore it for the MDN page that specifies its relevant BCD feature/query is `api.Response.json` but not ignore it if the MDN page specifies its relevant BCD feature/query is `api.Response.json.static`.

dlrobertson: what other parts of the range syntax do browsers support?

[01:30:36.0660] <Jake Archibald>
(I've replied to the issue)

[03:28:38.0282] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: About the controller PR, I ended up spelling out all the initiator types, it does feel cleaner than a string. The PR build passes now and I went through all the comments again, I think it's ready.

[05:38:47.0411] <dlrobertson>

Thanks! I'll comment in the issue as well

[05:45:52.0193] <dlrobertson>
tl;dr I think this would in practice only be used for blob slicing (and we don't have to support this)

foolip: sideshowbarker: IMO the more we can move the ecosystem away from incorrectly thinking of prototype/instance methods and properties as static ones the better... I'm excited that this is providing a forcing function. I hope one day strings like "Document.createElement" never appear in anyone's infrastructure...

It’s just a lot of work, and even if done there isn’t another agreed-upon shorthand, so I think we’ll keep seeing this for a long time…

[07:46:41.0060] <foolip>
Someone would have to go on a long and dedicated cleanup campaign to sort this out across MDN, BCD and maybe other places.
