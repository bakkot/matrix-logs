For the `elementtiming` content attribute, I haven’t found a PR for adding it to the HTML spec. Don’t we need one?
It’s not adequately specified in https://wicg.github.io/element-timing/#sec-modifications-DOM but from what can be gleaned from that, it seems like it would need to be added to HTML as a new global attribute. Right?

Yes, it looks like the Fetch PR is landed, I will land the HTML PR.

Yes, any HTML global attributes with multi-implementer interest should be specified in HTML. I suspect this is a single-implementer spec?

Hi all! I wish everyone is well! How are you all? 
1. I would like to publicize my GitHub profile here are the ideas implemented in Js. Some ideas I filed, I found it very bad to implement and they didn't have a good concept. In summary, I implemented the following ideas(apis): 'BestReadOnTheWeb', 'MeasuringUserInteractionTimeWithWebsite' - I would to have positive or negative feedback of each idea - if you all wants. Note: Other ideas I've shelved too - because they're bad ideas because they depend on other things and/or ideas to get done. Link: https://github.com/raphaellouisandress - the licenses for each code are MIT.
2. I hope I helped with a few things to make the web better, safer, transparent
3. I feel that after building some of these implementations my help has ended, goodbye folks. Keep up the great work all, I really enjoyed the feedback I got here.

sideshowbarker: there was some interest in `elementtiming` from Mozilla folks, but I'm not sure if it's enough for WHATWG HTML integration

yeah, it's okay to say we have interests informally, however I'd like this standard position issue https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/192 to be resolved first before adding the attribute
