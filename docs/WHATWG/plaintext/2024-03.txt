zcorpan: I vaguely recall there's an issue tracking something like that? I think there's also some things around navigation that are not being tracked accurately, such as the changes people want to make around bounce-tracking.

PSA: https://whatwg.org/stages is live (might have to hard refresh for better table styling)

so, I now have tests, and I checked epiphany (which should be webkit, right?), and load events for cross origin navigation of iframes is done there as well

[05:45:12.0303] <annevk>
That makes sense. That's been the behavior in browsers for literally decades and I think it's also what HTML still requires.

[05:46:10.0171] <annevk>
I don't really have a good idea for how to solve the issue here apart from not dispatching anything at all. Or maybe only dispatching for the initial load, but that will likely break things.

[05:49:12.0194] <farre>
I'm looking at aligning gecko to do this as well. it still leaves the timing issue, but at least it will be the same

[05:58:09.0393] <annevk>
Gecko doesn't fire an event currently?

[06:18:44.0864] <farre>
not when updating #hash, no

[07:08:25.0409] <annevk>
Wait what, firing a load event for that case doesn't sound right. I guess I missed something.

[07:08:35.0790] <annevk>
Looking forward to the tests. :-)

[07:33:47.0821] <farre>
np, I'll ping you a phabricator link tomorrow when I've run try. I'm planning on letting the tests get upstreamed from the gecko repo if you don't object

[07:45:34.0970] <annevk>
That seems fine. But if they don't match the specification please make sure they have `.tentative` in the name.

emilio mfreed: I think the CSS WG should probably come up with the native appearance story as it should be the same for all form controls, no? We want something with intrinsic width and height that uses the border-box. There's a number of things that should continue to work, such as transform, positioning, visibility, but there's also a number of things that shouldn't, such as background, font, etc. However, both of those lists are continuously evolving and it seems unreasonable for HTML to be in charge of that?

I will file an issue later today to get the conversation started.

annevk: hey, I was wondering if you have an idea when we could get a review of the shadowrealms pr

[06:34:15.0798] <annevk>
Ms2ger: last I heard implementers are skeptical on it. Has that changed? It's really hard to get a sense of the amount of buy-in this has beyond a handful of interested parties. Are there recent statements from Chromium and Gecko available?

[06:36:19.0151] <Ms2ger>
I can try to get statements if I can't find any

[06:38:44.0360] <annevk>
Ms2ger: thanks! For instance, https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm/issues/401 is the latest I saw from mgaudet. Which I guess is not really saying no, but it's not an enthusiastic endorsement either and perhaps something we need more clarity on to prevent a future `setTimeout()` issue.

[06:41:06.0491] <Ms2ger>
That's fair
