zcorpan: I vaguely recall there's an issue tracking something like that? I think there's also some things around navigation that are not being tracked accurately, such as the changes people want to make around bounce-tracking.

PSA: https://whatwg.org/stages is live (might have to hard refresh for better table styling)

[05:26:46.0427] <farre>
so, I now have tests, and I checked epiphany (which should be webkit, right?), and load events for cross origin navigation of iframes is done there as well

[05:45:12.0303] <annevk>
That makes sense. That's been the behavior in browsers for literally decades and I think it's also what HTML still requires.

[05:46:10.0171] <annevk>
I don't really have a good idea for how to solve the issue here apart from not dispatching anything at all. Or maybe only dispatching for the initial load, but that will likely break things.

[05:49:12.0194] <farre>
I'm looking at aligning gecko to do this as well. it still leaves the timing issue, but at least it will be the same

[05:58:09.0393] <annevk>
Gecko doesn't fire an event currently?

[06:18:44.0864] <farre>
not when updating #hash, no

[07:08:25.0409] <annevk>
Wait what, firing a load event for that case doesn't sound right. I guess I missed something.

[07:08:35.0790] <annevk>
Looking forward to the tests. :-)

[07:33:47.0821] <farre>
np, I'll ping you a phabricator link tomorrow when I've run try. I'm planning on letting the tests get upstreamed from the gecko repo if you don't object

[07:45:34.0970] <annevk>
That seems fine. But if they don't match the specification please make sure they have `.tentative` in the name.

[02:27:44.0703] <annevk>
emilio mfreed: I think the CSS WG should probably come up with the native appearance story as it should be the same for all form controls, no? We want something with intrinsic width and height that uses the border-box. There's a number of things that should continue to work, such as transform, positioning, visibility, but there's also a number of things that shouldn't, such as background, font, etc. However, both of those lists are continuously evolving and it seems unreasonable for HTML to be in charge of that?

I will file an issue later today to get the conversation started.

[06:27:19.0457] <Ms2ger>
annevk: hey, I was wondering if you have an idea when we could get a review of the shadowrealms pr

[06:34:15.0798] <annevk>
Ms2ger: last I heard implementers are skeptical on it. Has that changed? It's really hard to get a sense of the amount of buy-in this has beyond a handful of interested parties. Are there recent statements from Chromium and Gecko available?

[06:36:19.0151] <Ms2ger>
I can try to get statements if I can't find any

[06:38:44.0360] <annevk>
Ms2ger: thanks! For instance, https://github.com/tc39/proposal-shadowrealm/issues/401 is the latest I saw from mgaudet. Which I guess is not really saying no, but it's not an enthusiastic endorsement either and perhaps something we need more clarity on to prevent a future `setTimeout()` issue.

[06:41:06.0491] <Ms2ger>
That's fair

[06:49:37.0475] <annevk>

Could use editor review on https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10043 (easy) and https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10168 (bigger)

[17:13:00.0495] <akaster>
Is it expected that cryptographic keys created by SubtleCrypto are stored in a fun and secure place like a Trusted Platform Module or Secure Enclave? 

[17:13:12.0704] <akaster>
Or would that just be a quality of implementation bonus

[00:56:52.0341] <freddy>
it's not expected and afaiu subtlecrypto predates wide availability and adoption of TPM / enclaves

[00:58:54.0939] <annevk>
Domenic: I'll leave the bigger one for zcorpan.

[01:23:24.0559] <annevk>
yulia | sick: https://github.com/w3c/trusted-types/issues/471 is probably of interest to you. Maybe also to littledan.

[01:24:10.0887] <annevk>
freddy: you too I suppose. Some of the research participants could really use a built-in sanitizer.

[01:24:19.0909] <emilio>
annevk: jarhar: Do you know what kind of styling differences do we want for the `<select>` case in https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5998?

[01:25:04.0903] <emilio>
Basically, I think the main thing we really need is the non-replaced box stuff, but I'm not aware of all the intended differences between `base` and `none`

[01:25:07.0336] <annevk>
emilio: essentially we want to build something from the ground up, irrespective of auto/none styling.

[01:25:28.0194] <yulia | sick>
wow thats great

[01:25:29.0318] <emilio>
annevk: why? It seems virtually all the default `select` styles would be applicable to the "base" case

[01:26:17.0818] <yulia | sick>
(not really back yet)

[01:26:18.0951] <annevk>
emilio: the mechanism has to work for all form controls, not just `select`. So over-indexing on `select` doesn't seem useful.

[01:26:20.0224] <emilio>
annevk: modulo the `!important` stuff which right now can't be overridden by authors, but maybe we should just fix that

[01:27:00.0831] <emilio>
annevk: I guess I'm looking for a counter-example where it doesn't work. I've thought mostly about `<select>` and `<input switch>`, and seems not overcomplicating stuff would work for those at least

[01:27:55.0547] <emilio>
annevk: that is, the default styles for form controls are sorta reasonable, what is not customizable is the stuff inside them. And _that_ is fixable with appearance: base without weird hacks / internal mechanisms which are generally unsound

[01:33:12.0313] <annevk>
emilio: I don't think people want the base style to match the none style. They want something closer to the auto style, except not platform bound.

[01:35:39.0842] <annevk>
emilio: Also `select` like other form controls is currently undefined, except for like 3 properties?

[01:35:52.0404] <emilio>
annevk: I thought the point of `base` was basically give you control over the inner bits of the control. `none` already gives you something that is a functional control, and the system colors used there are in control of the UA, so can be changed. `border-radius` is the only tricky thing IMO

[01:36:11.0390] <emilio>
annevk: it doesn't have to be that way, select styles are fairly interoperable iirc?

[01:36:34.0841] <annevk>
No the point of `base` is to give somewhat unified cross-browser controls that are fully stylable, but also accessible, etc.

[01:37:06.0285] <annevk>
 * No the point of `base` is to give unified cross-browser controls that are fully stylable, but also accessible, etc.

[01:37:38.0502] <annevk>
I would expect some sort of consistency across `base` controls.

[01:37:44.0726] <emilio>
annevk: well, sure, my point is that `appearance: none` is that, except it doesn't let you style the stuff inside the control

[01:38:21.0753] <emilio>
and the "doesn't let you style stuff inside the control" part is solvable without weird shenanigans

[01:38:54.0884] <annevk>
It's not for checkboxes and it's also not really for other controls? Some of that might be fixable, but I don't think `none` always meets the bar. (And I'd rather `none` going forward actually mean `none`.)

[01:39:56.0338] <annevk>
(The stuff inside the control also has to be described in terms of CSS already for `base`, to be clear.)

[01:40:50.0774] <emilio>
Sure, but that's not an issue because we can do whatever in the UA sheet for inner elements / pseudos inside `base`, and have it not affect `none` / `auto`

[01:41:10.0354] <emilio>
You're right that checkboxes are an issue here, but those are the exception rather than the rule

[01:46:15.0732] <annevk>
emilio: I think the pseudo elements should also work for `none`.

[01:47:10.0786] <emilio>
annevk: that doesn't match how `none` behaves right now, but maybe, if we can get away with it? But that means that we should make the `none` behavior also describable via css.

[02:00:48.0332] <annevk>
emilio: the solution has to work for checkboxes too though. But I also think we want the freedom to be able to change certain things (such as the default size) for `base` to make them really good defaults for people to build on.

[02:01:46.0283] <annevk>
As such I don't really believe in trying to shoehorn it into the existing mess (which I do agree we should clean up as well, but I think we're more limited there in what can be done).

[02:06:35.0610] <emilio>
annevk: I don't see why it wouldn't work for checkboxes fwiw, assuming checkboxes gain some pseudo tree (which they'd need to, right), you could style that however you want. You'd need some special code to not render that tree in the `none` case, to match existing behavior, but that seems feasible

[02:08:00.0015] <emilio>
annevk: I don't think we want css magic, because whatever that magic is we're going to need to explain it to authors. And this is exactly the kind of magic that we don't want to expose to the web (https://wiki.csswg.org/faq#selectors-that-depend-on-layout)

[02:09:02.0741] <emilio>
Anyways I need to go do some work, but I think we can get away without CSS magic.

[02:37:39.0827] <annevk>
I think it's fine to have "magic" when it's constrained. This wouldn't really become a generic thing, it's just for form controls. You want the magic to be more tightly scoped it seems, but I'd rather have it a little wider to decouple things a little more.

[06:54:53.0415] <jarhar>
for appearance:base select as i am trying to implement it, most of the actual new styles are on the button and the datalist children, not the select itself, which makes it easier to put in the UA stylesheet. It looks kind of bad imo to still have the border and other stuff there from the appearance:auto select around the parent element of the button, but maybe once i finish implementing appearance:base and demo it to some more people then maybe nobody will care that much and we can just leave the UA rules in there.

[06:55:14.0179] <jarhar>
if you look at the "actual" and "expected" pictures of this test output, you can see what difference the built-in borders make: https://chromium-layout-test-archives.storage.googleapis.com/results.html?json=chromium/try/linux-rel/1729863/blink_wpt_tests%20%28with%20patch%29/full_results_jsonp.js

[06:55:53.0010] <jarhar>
also it should probably be completely the same across browsers by default when using appearance:base, and if we aren't using the same UA border rule for select then that wouldn't be the case anymore

[09:01:03.0560] <jub0bs>
Hey all. I have some more thoughts about CORS...

[09:04:14.0077] <jub0bs>
A common misunderstanding (dispelled by annevk [long ago](https://twitter.com/annevk/status/948831079649169408)) about CORS is that it is some kind of defence. I think some overeager middleware libraries can be blamed for this, but I'm starting to wonder whether CORS error messages in Chrome specifically could be improved:

> Access to fetch at 'https://example.org' from origin 'https://example.com' has been _blocked by CORS policy_. [...]

My emphasis.


[09:06:03.0131] <jub0bs>
The phrase "blocked by CORS policy" seems to mislead some practitioners into conflating the effects of the SOP and CORS. How about something like the following message instead?

Two: Some folks attempt to solve their CORS issues by including an `Origin` header in their request. Of course, because `Origin` is a [forbidden request-header name](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-request-header), user agents deny clients' attempts to include such a header in a request. The XHR API is vocal about it and issues an error message:

```
httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
httpRequest.open('GET', 'https://www.example.com', true);
httpRequest.setRequestHeader("Origin", "http://localhost")
httpRequest.send(null);
```

```

jub0bs: for 1/2, improving warning messages is probably best filed directly with web browsers. Maybe sideshowbarker has done some work on these in the past perhaps. I'd certainly be open to reviewing WebKit patches that improve this. For 3, I think that's also best done as a warning message by web browsers. I wouldn't want to constrain what people can do with HTTP at the API level, but giving them a hint they're likely making a mistake seems reasonable.

[09:39:17.0034] <jub0bs>
annevk: Thanks. I was hoping to catch some browser folks here, actually. As for 3, I believe a warning would be a good middle ground.

jub0bs: If you raise bugs and Cc me, I would be happy to write browser patches for adding warnings or improving existing ones.

And while we’re at it, I think we should also try to get a patch landed to make Chrome stop emitting the _“If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled"_ message.

…because to 99.99% or whatever of web developers, that message is in practice the complete opposite of being helpful to them.

[01:29:02.0220] <jub0bs>
sideshowbarker: True. Many people believe that setting the request's mode to `'no-cors`' will magically resolve their CORS issues.

[01:30:14.0072] <jub0bs>

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#reflecting-content-attributes-in-idl-attributes:reflected-idl-attribute-31 is somehow oddly written

[04:27:54.0466] <smaug>
first there are some items, and after them actual getter and setter steps. But what is for example the first item? Is that part of some algorithm or is it not?

[05:12:31.0223] <annevk>
smaug: the first list item is introducing a shorthand, used in the remaining list items for defining infrastructure

[05:13:46.0167] <annevk>
I do agree it's a bit strange, but I also wasn't sure how to refactor it when I last fixed some reflecting stuff.

[06:32:47.0877] <Dominic Farolino>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/C#becomes-connected happens when the insertion steps for an element are called *and* it is "connected". But can the insertion steps ever be called for an element that's _disconnected_?

[07:44:24.0592] <Jake Archibald>
Folks who are familiar with `delegatesFocus`… what are the use-cases? Is it much different to putting everything in the shadow root in a `<label>` pointing to the field?

[09:15:04.0715] <keithamus>
Jake Archibald: or a custom button or similar.

[09:17:27.0723] <keithamus>
https://github.com/muan/input-duration-element an example in the real world.

[09:21:52.0084] <Jake Archibald>
Yeah, support for `.focus()` is nice. I guess I don't always want the "clicking anything in the shadow root delegates focus to one element" thing


2024-03-09
[22:10:02.0761] <Domenic>
IIRC it was mainly added because we knew built-in controls like `<input type=date>` had that behavior.

Hello, does anyone know about the "willful violation of RFC 5322" note in section 4.10.5.1.5 Email state of the whatwg HTML spec? The comment raises some concern for me, since RFC-5322 is not the appropriate standard to find the syntax of email addresses as used on the public Internet today to route email. The correct standard is RFC-5321, which defines the SMTP protocol and includes a grammar for Mailbox which is what most people think of as an email address. This is what people sometimes call the "envelope" address.

The RFC-5322 document specifies the format of the email message content, not the protocol used to transport mail.

So, yeah: you should not follow RFC-5322, but you should follow RFC-5321.


[23:40:55.0276] <annevk>
dean.highpower: there's a long discussion in https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4562 without much progress, though someone from the i18n WG might make another attempt this year.

Hello, I badly apologize if the question does not fit this room, but I'm having trouble understanding a piece of JavaScript code and no one could help me in regular javascript servers. The code I'm concerned with is the following (ready to use):
```js
(async () => {
    const stream = (function* chunks(json) {
        const jsonString = JSON.stringify(json);
        const jsonBytes = new TextEncoder().encode(jsonString);
    
        let index = 0;
        while(index < jsonBytes.length) {
            const i = index;
            const j = Math.min(jsonBytes.length, i + 10);
    
            const slice = jsonBytes.slice(i, j);    // LINE (A)
            index = j;
            yield slice;
        }
    })({"Hello!": [2023, 2024 ]});
    
    const jsonBack = await new Response(new ReadableStream({
        type: "bytes",
        start: function(controller) {
            for(const chunk of stream) {
                controller.enqueue(chunk);
            }
            controller.close();
        }
    })).json();
    
    console.log(jsonBack);
})()
```
this code works as expected (google chrome, firefox; latest versions). However, when I replace in line A, `.slice` with `.subarray`, I get different kind of issues, telling me the JSON ends abnormally (in both browsers). I've crawled the official specification of the different API's, and I couldn't find a single clue about whether or not the version with `.subarray` violates the specification. 

For what is worth, turning `.json()` to `.text()` confirms that in the `.subarray` case, only the first chunk seems to be taken into account. I assume (but not sure about it) the same happens for `.json()`.

My question, to make it clear, is: is the current code with `.slice` already violating a point of the specification; and is the version with `.subarray` violates it and how? Could it be a browser bug, common to both Firefox and Google Chrome? Many thanks in advance! This issue puzzles me a lot for some days now

Do you mean "reasonable options" for fixing the CORS error? I'm not sure I can think of more than what I've already suggested, tbh. One difficulty is that browsers are often left with insufficient contextual information about a preflight failure to produce a helpful error message. For a typical example, see https://jub0bs.com/posts/2023-02-08-fearless-cors/#9-ease-troubleshooting-by-eschewing-shortcuts-during-preflight

okay for what's worth, I understood what happened here. When enqueuing, the buffer is detached. This forces the length to go down to 0, which abruptly terminates my emission loop and I never emit more than 1 chunk, which is the cause of all issues. That's why I don't have the expected TypeError, since actually I never pass a detached buffer, as the loop terminates after.

I must say debugging this was kind of an adventure! Not sure if it's all clear for everyone that enqueue detaches the buffer, while reading the documentation. but I eventually found it, collecting all the pieces together

[09:12:52.0213] <dean.highpower>
That issue is regarding the extension of the Mailbox grammar in RFC-5321 to support Unicode, which is done in RFC-6531, section 3.3 Extended Mailbox Address Syntax. I should note that the analogous extensions of all the the RFC-5322 grammars is done in RFC-6532.
So yeah, get the basic US-ASCII syntax right by using the grammar in 5321, then extend for Unicode using 6531.


[09:15:24.0015] <dean.highpower>
The way the JSON Schema Validation standard handles this is to recognize two types: "email" for the US-ASCII style, and "idn-email" for an Mailbox address supporting Unicode.

[15:07:12.0598] <dean.highpower>
annevk: I put in my $0.02 in the github issue. Does anyone take the position that RFC-5322 (+RFC-6532) is the relevant standard for email address syntax? (As implied by the "willful violation" comment?)

Per https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#rules-for-parsing-floating-point-number-values, when parsing floating-point number values should implementation return Infinity and NaN if that’s the number value a string parses to — or instead should implementations treat Infinity and NaN be treated as errors ?

In that HTML spec algorithm itself, there’s nothing explicit about handling Infinity and NaN — but in the WebIDL spec at https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-idl-float①, I see:

[00:34:19.0030] <Domenic>
sideshowbarker: the HTML algorithm treats strings like "Infinity" or "NaN" as errors, if that's what you're asking. It's completely separate from the Web IDL algorithm, and has different call sites.

[00:38:02.0335] <annevk>
I'm not sure, but I think there's definitely a worry about changing the existing contract drastically as it'll impact many websites.

[00:38:25.0109] <sideshowbarker>
So I guess the only way that algorithm would ever return Inifinity or NaN is if it were given "Infinity" or "NaN"  as input? If so then I guess another way to state it is: The algorithm never returns "Infinity" or "NaN" — it always returns either an actual number, or any error?

That looks correct, from a quick glance.

[00:43:53.0623] <Domenic>
The latter statement seems correct. But the former doesn't. If the algorithm were given "Infinity" or "NaN" as an input, then it would return error, not Infinity or NaN.

[00:45:41.0791] <sideshowbarker>
Right, sorry — I misspoke there. I guess meant to say something more like, The only way something would end up getting _evaluated_ (not returned) by the algorithm as Inifinity or NaN would be if it the algorithm were given the strings "Infinity" or "NaN"  as input.

Ooh. I noticed the "lookup" column just now. That explains fetchability vs. display.

[05:38:59.0688] <hsivonen>
annevk: I'm looking at the unit tests of the IDNA crate and have trouble believing what I'm seeing. Is it really intentional that empty DNS labels are allowed in URLs as long as the domain as a whole isn't empty? (Somehow I imagined that only a trailing empty label was allowed.) Browsers don't seem to treat hsivonen.fi.xn-- as equivalent to hsivonen.fi. , but I fail to find spec text that says so. What am I missing?

[05:42:21.0971] <annevk>
So `https://example..com/` parses. I think I was surprised by that as well. Not sure about `xn--` though.

[05:48:05.0652] <annevk>
hsivonen: I guess what's not clear is where decoding `xn--` fails. It does seem good for it to fail though as it would normalize away, which seems bad.

> <@annevk:matrix.org> hsivonen: I guess what's not clear is where decoding `xn--` fails. It does seem good for it to fail though as it would normalize away, which seems bad.

When reading the RFC, I don't see `xn--` failing at all.

[05:49:21.0422] <hsivonen>
annevk: But are other empty labels supposed to be allowed. Is hsivonen..fi really supposed to be allowed?

[05:49:45.0343] <annevk>
hsivonen: I think it has worked in all browsers since forever?

[05:50:36.0460] <annevk>
If we just did DNS there's a whole bunch of things we could ban, but we don't and therefore it's trickier.

[05:51:33.0997] <hsivonen>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> hsivonen: I think it has worked in all browsers since forever?

Ah, in Firefox the URL bar behavior depends on the URL scheme being there

[05:53:54.0222] <annevk>
I think per https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#ProcessingStepPunycode and https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3492.html `xn--` is indeed expected to become the empty string. That seems like a bug though.

More generally, it seems like a bug not to require Punycode decode to output at least one non-ASCII code point.

[07:43:04.0088] <dean.highpower>
The existing HTML spec respects no RFC (5321 or 5322), instead invents a new syntax for email addresses. This new syntax rejects perfectly valid us-ascii mailbox addresses that are and have been valid (since at least 1982) with no apparent basis. This is harmful. I have seen this new syntax used by other projects, citing the HTML spec as the authority for their "willful violation of RFC 5322" -- with no mention of the standard they *should* be looking at, RFC-5321.
I understand the practical considerations of wanting a simple grammar to check against. Could we specify a simple syntax check that would not reject any mailbox address considered valid by RFC-5321?
A strict check could be used to test *exact* adherence to the RFC, such checkers exist for many languages. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/smtp-address-parser for JavaScript.)
The HTML spec is a "living standard" so should be open to change. Please can we fix it?
