Hi! Do you know a debug tool such a firefox console to list trusted type tags in dom please?

[05:01:22.0693] <freddy>
I work on Firefox and my team is responsible for Trusted Types, but I am not sure what your question is.

[05:01:46.0473] <freddy>
Also, we don't really support Trusted Types yet. It's behind a pref in Nightly specifically because it doesn't fully work.

[05:02:09.0576] <freddy>
Maybe #security:mozilla.org would be a better discussion channel.

Something like that yeah

Whoa, someone left a lot of spam. Thanks for dealing with it Domenic!

annevk: I'm going through Ladybird failures on the scoped custom element registry tests, and passing a registry to `Document.importNode()` isn't making sense to me. I see that Safari passes all of custom-elements/registries/Document-importNode.html, so maybe the implementation doesn't match the spec there. I'm looking at the second subtest there:

`assert_true(document.importNode(document.createElement('some-element'), {customElementRegistry: scopedRegistry}) instanceof ScopedSomeElement);`

`some-element` gets created using the document's registry. The test then expects `importNode()` to return a node that is using `scopedRegistry` instead. But, the registry is passed as `cloneNode()`'s `fallbackRegistry`, and that's only used if the node doesn't already have a registry. And it does have one!

[03:00:02.0453] <AtkinsSJ>
The idea of cloning a custom element and getting a different type of custom element seems strange to me but maybe I just need to read up on that more.

Hey, im reading through the spec and have a question. Hope this is the place to ask. The first point from the section on inserting a node into a parent is unclear to me: https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-insert

It says:
> Let nodes be node’s children, if node is a DocumentFragment node; otherwise « node ».

What does "<< node >>" mean?


[04:33:53.0799] <AtkinsSJ>
It means it's a list. https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list

[04:35:26.0148] <Martin Spasov>
that was fast, thank you!

[04:36:30.0271] <AtkinsSJ>
You're welcome!

[05:19:22.0925] <annevk>
AtkinsSJ: that might well be a bug. I think we decided that `importNode()` wouldn't change the registry (except if its null).

[05:24:33.0136] <annevk>
AtkinsSJ: yeah I don't think WebKit matches the specification.
