Hi! Do you know a debug tool such a firefox console to list trusted type tags in dom please?

[05:01:22.0693] <freddy>
I work on Firefox and my team is responsible for Trusted Types, but I am not sure what your question is.

[05:01:46.0473] <freddy>
Also, we don't really support Trusted Types yet. It's behind a pref in Nightly specifically because it doesn't fully work.

[05:02:09.0576] <freddy>
Maybe #security:mozilla.org would be a better discussion channel.

* sideshowbarker: doing (very late) spring cleanup?

[23:09:26.0045] <sideshowbarker>
Something like that yeah

[23:14:47.0475] <annevk>
Whoa, someone left a lot of spam. Thanks for dealing with it Domenic!

[02:55:27.0378] <AtkinsSJ>
annevk: I'm going through Ladybird failures on the scoped custom element registry tests, and passing a registry to `Document.importNode()` isn't making sense to me. I see that Safari passes all of custom-elements/registries/Document-importNode.html, so maybe the implementation doesn't match the spec there. I'm looking at the second subtest there:

`assert_true(document.importNode(document.createElement('some-element'), {customElementRegistry: scopedRegistry}) instanceof ScopedSomeElement);`

`some-element` gets created using the document's registry. The test then expects `importNode()` to return a node that is using `scopedRegistry` instead. But, the registry is passed as `cloneNode()`'s `fallbackRegistry`, and that's only used if the node doesn't already have a registry. And it does have one!

[03:00:02.0453] <AtkinsSJ>
The idea of cloning a custom element and getting a different type of custom element seems strange to me but maybe I just need to read up on that more.

Hello freddy I am happy to meat the core team!

I was asking, how can I see in the inspector of the dom of mozilla if the result of an innerHTML or what else creation is TrustedTYpe or not pleqse? I need to check for xss.

[04:33:01.0703] <Martin Spasov>
Hey, im reading through the spec and have a question. Hope this is the place to ask. The first point from the section on inserting a node into a parent is unclear to me: https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-insert

It says:
> Let nodes be nodeâ€™s children, if node is a DocumentFragment node; otherwise Â« node Â».

What does "<< node >>" mean?


[04:33:53.0799] <AtkinsSJ>
It means it's a list. https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list

[04:35:26.0148] <Martin Spasov>
that was fast, thank you!

[04:36:30.0271] <AtkinsSJ>
You're welcome!

[05:19:22.0925] <annevk>
AtkinsSJ: that might well be a bug. I think we decided that `importNode()` wouldn't change the registry (except if its null).

[05:24:33.0136] <annevk>
AtkinsSJ: yeah I don't think WebKit matches the specification.

Once again not seeing anything agenda+ed for tomorrow's WHATNOT.  Should I cancel it?

What does it mean when the HTML spec says that something "is expected to act as follows"? Is it different from "should act as follows"?

[18:54:13.0366] <Domenic>
It's probably nothing special, but there is a specific case in which "expected" has a special meaning: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#rendering

[18:56:22.0613] <jmdyck>
Okay, thanks.

[22:14:51.0034] <annevk>
jmdyck: it'd prolly be "must" not "should"

Hello. I am looking for an rss feed as well as any way to get the latest update in w3c spec. I need to get the latest update for cyber security research.

Do you know a such rss feeed please?

[01:27:46.0703] <AtkinsSJ>
Depends what exactly you're after but there's https://www.w3.org/news/feed/

[01:30:56.0630] <AtkinsSJ>
The HTML spec (and a few others) are run by the WHATWG instead which is separate from W3C. I don't think there's a feed for those. What I've ended up doing is subscribing to the github repo for the specs I care about. There are feeds if needed, eg https://github.com/whatwg/html/commits/main.atom

[01:34:10.0764] <AtkinsSJ>
Would you like me open an issue about it? I'm not sure which repo to place it under.

[02:01:30.0204] <gogo>
> <@atkinssj:serenityos.org> Depends what exactly you're after but there's https://www.w3.org/news/feed/

Sounds good. Letvme cgeck.

[02:08:16.0911] <annevk>
AtkinsSJ: I am planning to create a WPT PR later today, based on https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/47489

[02:13:56.0820] <gogo>
> <@atkinssj:serenityos.org> Depends what exactly you're after but there's https://www.w3.org/news/feed/

I am after new features and if possible cybercsec alerts.

[02:24:37.0464] <gogo>
The main.atom does not sounds presents in any repo https://github.com/tomnomnom/wappalyzer/commits/main.atom

[02:25:46.0580] <AtkinsSJ>
The "main" is the name of the branch. In some repos that's "main", others it's "master", or it could be something else.

[02:26:19.0047] <AtkinsSJ>
Looks like removing the branch name and just doing github.com/tomnomnom/wappalyzer/commits.atom works

[02:31:50.0556] <gogo>
oh my god thank you for the trick! I had previously created a git diff script to grep latest updates

[02:32:04.0701] <gogo>
there are 2 different purposes of course

[02:33:27.0688] <gogo>
time to register to https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commits/main.atom lol :)

[02:56:54.0522] <gogo>
> <@atkinssj:serenityos.org> Depends what exactly you're after but there's https://www.w3.org/news/feed/

I like the feed. I am looking purely on new feature. If possiblevon features thzt enables js please?

[04:42:58.0248] <AtkinsSJ>

[07:33:57.0662] <smaug>
nm then

[11:23:05.0139] <gogo>
no worry. I already advanced a lot of with the main branch updates! After I can subscribe to the feed

[11:27:32.0415] <gogo>
sounds very good. I am a noob with rss feed. Is there any category?

Hi all, just a friendly reminder to post any discussion topics for this Thursday's joint CSSWG/WHATWG/OpenUI task force meeting to the meeting agenda issue: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11435

[09:22:04.0393] <keithamus>
Just trying to look at the updates to https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#valid-element-local-name and I feel like there's a discrepancy...

The regexp (`/^(?:[A-Za-z][^\0\t\n\f\r\u0020/>]*|[:_\u0080-\u{10FFFF}][A-Za-z0-9-.:_\u0080-\u{10FFFF}]*)$/u`) validates that `a-\x01` returns `true` but as best as I can see the regexp does not follow the spec prose. Specifically the first match group of `/^[A-Za-z][^\0\t\n\f\r\u0020/>]*$/` says "must start with a letter, then should be any character _except_ these code points" but the prose says something quite different. 

Am I missing something obvious? /cc jarhar Domenic 

[09:23:07.0081] <keithamus>
Oh... I see, the prose has branches for the whole string with an early return. 

[09:23:49.0129] <keithamus>
I glossed over step 2.2.

Hello fellow humans

[16:34:12.0768] <jarhar>
anything i can do to help get https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10548 merged? i believe that i've addressed all the comment threads.

If you are working on implementing that note that there is currently a bit of a mismatch between spec and tests that we are fixing in https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1387 / https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/1388 / https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/53533
