For https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#attr-writingsuggestions can somebody remind me why the empty string is a conforming value for that — even though the table there only explicitly lists `true` and `false` as the allowed values?

[17:46:44.0304] <sideshowbarker>
And note that at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3:~:text=writingsuggestions the index of attributes is where the spec (though non-normatively there, I guess) states that the empty string is an allowed value.

[17:48:03.0230] <sideshowbarker>
…and similarly for, e.g., the `spellcheck` attribute, the index at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3:~:text=spellcheck also says the empty string is allowed for that.

[17:48:51.0957] <sideshowbarker>
And for `hidden` too https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3:~:text=hidden,-HTML

[17:50:10.0920] <sideshowbarker>
But looking at the whole index, I guess it’s just those three which the index says are allowed to have the empty string as a value. `hidden`, `spellcheck`, and `writingsuggestions`
