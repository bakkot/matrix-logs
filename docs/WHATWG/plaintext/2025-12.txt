For https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#attr-writingsuggestions can somebody remind me why the empty string is a conforming value for that — even though the table there only explicitly lists `true` and `false` as the allowed values?

[17:46:44.0304] <sideshowbarker>
And note that at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3:~:text=writingsuggestions the index of attributes is where the spec (though non-normatively there, I guess) states that the empty string is an allowed value.

[17:48:03.0230] <sideshowbarker>
…and similarly for, e.g., the `spellcheck` attribute, the index at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3:~:text=spellcheck also says the empty string is allowed for that.

[17:48:51.0957] <sideshowbarker>
And for `hidden` too https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3:~:text=hidden,-HTML

[17:50:10.0920] <sideshowbarker>
But looking at the whole index, I guess it’s just those three which the index says are allowed to have the empty string as a value. `hidden`, `spellcheck`, and `writingsuggestions`

[17:52:02.0659] <sideshowbarker>
…whereas, in contrast, if you look at what the index says about other enumerated — such as `wrap` at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3:~:text=integer-,wrap — the index _does not_ say the empty string is allowed.

[17:53:34.0633] <sideshowbarker>
see `popover` at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3:~:text=popover,-HTML for another empty-string-not-allowed example

[17:58:53.0000] <sideshowbarker>
d’oh nevermind — found the requirement at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#enumerated-attribute:~:text=The%20empty%20string,-and

> For authoring conformance purposes, if an enumerated attribute is specified, the attribute's value must be one of:
>
> - An [ASCII case-insensitive](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive) match for one of the conforming keywords for that attribute, with no leading or trailing whitespace.
>
> - The empty string and the attribute must have an [empty value default](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#empty-value-default) defined.
