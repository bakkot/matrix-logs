It's not useful to know that it can only throw due to OOM? Is there anything else?

[08:46:36.0334] <Domenic>
Stack overflow IIRC was a big thing for our implementation

annevk: I'm not sure. Certainly for reading the specification, and trying to hold it together as a concept I think it's helpful. As an implementer, I'm less sure of the value (could be wrong, would welcome other opinion). 

[09:55:30.0931] <mgaudet>
I know I definitely came into some of this with an incorrect assumption that OOM handling was something done on the web in complicated code bases-- that seems to not actually be the case though?

[09:56:32.0326] <mgaudet>
(The concern I had/have is broken streams that originate from states 'impossible' in the specification, generated by things like OOM, or stack overflow)

Hey, I noticed setting Node.parentElement works in all browsers. But the spec says it is readonly, doesn't that mean setting it should throw. Or am I missing something?

How could I get someone else interested in https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3255  ?

ah never mind, I was trying this in the inspector console, which doesn't use `"use strict"` I guess

mgaudet: I think only for ArrayBuffer allocation is OOM defined; some have the ambition to define it more exhaustively, but I haven't seen progress on that for many years

I will ping the relevant internal team chat, and make frowny faces at them for not responding earlier :(

Thank you!

hober: by any chance, do you happen to know examples of "we found several examples of web pages that had incorrect behavior when requestAnimationFrame() callbacks were fired at a non-60Hz frequency." mentioned in https://github.com/WebKit/explainers/tree/main/animation-frame-rate ?

I'll ask!

Anyone can explain the difference between embed and iframe tags? (any reason to ever use embed instead of iframe in modern browsers)
