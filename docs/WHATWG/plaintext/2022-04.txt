It's not useful to know that it can only throw due to OOM? Is there anything else?

Stack overflow IIRC was a big thing for our implementation

annevk: I'm not sure. Certainly for reading the specification, and trying to hold it together as a concept I think it's helpful. As an implementer, I'm less sure of the value (could be wrong, would welcome other opinion).

I know I definitely came into some of this with an incorrect assumption that OOM handling was something done on the web in complicated code bases-- that seems to not actually be the case though?

(The concern I had/have is broken streams that originate from states 'impossible' in the specification, generated by things like OOM, or stack overflow)
