It's not useful to know that it can only throw due to OOM? Is there anything else?

[08:46:36.0334] <Domenic>
Stack overflow IIRC was a big thing for our implementation

[09:55:29.0747] <mgaudet>
annevk: I'm not sure. Certainly for reading the specification, and trying to hold it together as a concept I think it's helpful. As an implementer, I'm less sure of the value (could be wrong, would welcome other opinion). 

[09:55:30.0931] <mgaudet>
I know I definitely came into some of this with an incorrect assumption that OOM handling was something done on the web in complicated code bases-- that seems to not actually be the case though?

[09:56:32.0326] <mgaudet>
(The concern I had/have is broken streams that originate from states 'impossible' in the specification, generated by things like OOM, or stack overflow) 

[13:21:31.0325] <Jesper van den Ende>
Hey, I noticed setting Node.parentElement works in all browsers. But the spec says it is readonly, doesn't that mean setting it should throw. Or am I missing something?

[13:24:06.0541] <evilpie>
How could I get someone else interested in https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3255  ?

ah never mind, I was trying this in the inspector console, which doesn't use `"use strict"` I guess

[08:37:20.0920] <annevk>
mgaudet: I think only for ArrayBuffer allocation is OOM defined; some have the ambition to define it more exhaustively, but I haven't seen progress on that for many years

[14:51:15.0749] <Andreu Botella>
come to think about it, maybe embed and object could be moved to the obsolete features section

[14:52:18.0944] <vrafaeli>
btw nice to see you Andreu. I think we chatted a bit before on IRC


2022-04-06
[23:35:57.0122] <annevk>
Yeah, the plan is to obsolete `embed`/`object`. `object` in particular has some capabilities that are unique to it still, but we're chipping away at those.

[01:02:51.0320] <annevk>
GitHub's "smart URL paste" continues to trip me up, I keep forgetting it's there and ending up with a result I don't want

[01:03:18.0944] <annevk>
And I kinda worry that if I learn it I'll expect it in other places and run into trouble there

[02:23:57.0117] <freddy>
I'm looking for something that resets a whole document, including expando attributes etc. - I suppose I could emulate this by serializing+parsing the whole document or by cloning it. But, ideally, I'm looking for existing patterns for this "reset" or at least individual puzzle pieces. It seems to me that even the puzzle piece that removes "all" event handlers from an element seems to be a "no" already :/

[04:54:03.0550] <annevk>
freddy: "document open steps" does a bunch of that

[04:55:20.0364] <freddy>
I _did_ see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dynamic-markup-insertion.html#opening-the-input-stream, but it "replace the document with a new object" sounded to me as if the corresponding element-tree would be gone?!

[04:56:03.0246] <freddy>
OK, I realize I only read the non-normative stuff (I feel bad now)

[04:56:08.0438] <freddy>
 * OK, I realize I only read the non-normative stuff (I feel bad now)

[04:57:36.0122] <annevk>
freddy: it definitely doesn't do sanitization though; for sanitize() I'm still curious what the actual envisioned usage patterns are

[04:58:13.0194] <annevk>
But we do have primitives such as "remove all listeners" in the platform, but they're not widely available

[04:59:41.0350] <freddy>
Yeah, so the thing is that there's an apparent lack of "inside knowledge" from the sanitizer folks (freddy, otherdaniel, koto) about the potential state that could be attached to the document. The lack of knowledge lead to a security-conservative "we want it all gone" design goal. Similar to the other security-conservative choices we made (can't just a string-to-string API and hope for the best, can't parse a string with implicit/wrong context element, etc.).

[05:00:17.0222] <freddy>
So, one ideas is that I'm trying to find out if there's an algorithm that would a) shine some light on the apparent lack of details and b) alleviate the concerns by being an existing thing.

[05:00:54.0823] <annevk>
Again though, what's the actual input here? If you start with a tree, don't you have to trust that tree already?

[05:01:08.0909] <freddy>
On the other hand, I know that all other sanitizer libraries traverse a DOM tree based on the input (or parse it based on the input) and not even re-use those elements but create completely new ones and copy the bits over selectively. Which is a bit like a clone, but more... iterative

[05:01:56.0050] <freddy>
No. You don't. E.g., `<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin" src="bad stuff>` contains attacker-controlled stuff and you want to "promote" it into the current document, but need it to be sanitized first

[05:02:13.0997] <freddy>
so `sanitize(iframe.contentDocument)`

[05:03:50.0083] <freddy>
OK, admittedly a `sandbox`ed iframe wouldn't have event listeners (because it doesnt script). But maybe your privilege-separation mechanism is `<iframe sandbox="allow-script" src="some-sandbox-domain-for-user-content">` (google, github, mdn, bugzilla use those sandbox-domains _A LOT_). And if you'd want to promote that into a current document you wouldn't iframe it, but instead `XHR()` it and sanitize the returned `document`

[05:04:03.0954] <freddy>

Let me explain one thing that I'm concerned now. Imagine the following scenario.
You list through several PDFs, and in-between (when the loading happens for example) you don't want to show the document.

But I guess we don't want the iframe/embed/object to be removed from the DOM and then added again, cause that might cause performance penalty?
We can hide this HTML element using CSS I guess which is probably optimal.
One of the alternatives is to put "about:blank" in the "src" attribute. But then "iframe" will lose the type information.
So I'm concerned that in this alternative the browser's PDF engine will get "remounted" which might cause performance penalty?

(this is perhaps browser specific thing, but I'd appreciate your thoughts on this)

[09:40:04.0483] <annevk>
freddy: how would you get iframe.contentDocument unless it's same-origin?

[09:47:07.0133] <freddy>
annevk: (Sorry, I somehow changed direction midsentence above?!) I suppose the more realistic scenario, is that the content is on a sandbox domain that is CORS-enabled and you fetch it via XHR? OK, I see...then the follow-up question is why would anyone add stuff to the document before sanitizing? Mh. I suppose assuming that a framework is operating in mysterious ways? Realistically, people don't write all the code themselves. I admit that it's getting handwavy. 😕 But given that we took the conservative approach with all string-returning APIs, why don't we take the conservative approach when accepting documents?

[09:48:19.0996] <freddy>
Actually, I really have to disconnect. I will be back tomorrow.

[10:24:07.0495] <annevk>
freddy: the conservative approach is to just add setHTML() until we understand this better, imo

hey, folks! i think there's a couple of issues with the [named character reference state](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#named-character-reference-state) in the html spec but i wanted to check i'm not missing anything before filing an issue...

- the example says character references are not parsed in attributes, but this is not reflected in the algorithm. wouldn't a properly matched name would fall in the `if there's a match > otherwise` branch? (if inside attribute AND last not a semicolon AND followed by either equals or alphanumeric, then flush it, _otherwise_...)
- while browsers will indeed not parse `&notit;` in attributes, they'll parse at least `&amp;`, `&quot;` and `&apos;`, so even if the example is right it doesn't seem to be the whole story

does this seem right?

Hi

[07:35:53.0600] <vrafaeli>
Anyone knows what the hack is going on with iframe:
https://codesandbox.io/s/iframe-size-bug-bb3hgi?file=/src/App.tsx
Why is it 10% bigger than the defined size? same in Chrome and Mozilla

(The space on the right seems to be of the size of the vetical scrollbar, which is not there. Perhaps the same is true for the bottom excessive size.)

[07:52:06.0376] <emilio>
Without having looked in depth (on the phone) iframes have borders by default, and the default box-sizing is content-box, so the width is what you specified plus borders

[08:03:22.0721] <vrafaeli>
> <@emilio:mozilla.org> Without having looked in depth (on the phone) iframes have borders by default, and the default box-sizing is content-box, so the width is what you specified plus borders

You are rigth regarding the borders. I noticed that also. But the borders are only 2px big. Removing them does reduce the size by negligible amount.

[08:05:14.0764] <vrafaeli>
Seems like the additional size is (borders +) scrollbar

[08:06:44.0515] <vrafaeli>
first is with the 2px iframe border, second is without that

[08:38:38.0591] <vrafaeli>
> <@emilio:mozilla.org> Without having looked in depth (on the phone) iframes have borders by default, and the default box-sizing is content-box, so the width is what you specified plus borders

 * You are correct about the fact that borders do exist. I noticed that also. But the borders are only 2px big and removing them does reduce the size by negligible amount.

[08:50:40.0908] <emilio>
vrafaeli: ok at the computer now. Other than the border, what you're seeing is that the iframe is baseline-aligned by default. You can avoid that with `display: block`, for example

[08:51:02.0659] <emilio>
`<iframe>` is `display: inline` by default, like `<img>` and other replaced elements

[08:52:26.0573] <emilio>
Also `vertical-align: top` would work in your example

[08:52:32.0363] <emilio>
Anyways that's all behaving as expected

> <@emilio:mozilla.org> vrafaeli: ok at the computer now. Other than the border, what you're seeing is that the iframe is baseline-aligned by default. You can avoid that with `display: block`, for example

I see. Thanks a lot.

[10:11:45.0008] <annevk>
mrkishi: it's an example, by necessity it's not the whole story; and it's an example about a very specific instance so generalizing from it in that way would be wrong

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> mrkishi: it's an example, by necessity it's not the whole story; and it's an example about a very specific instance so generalizing from it in that way would be wrong

right, but the example isn't reflected in the algorithm, and neither is current browser behavior... unless i'm missing something?

[10:14:23.0120] <mrkishi>
i know examples aren't normative :p

[10:14:57.0128] <annevk>
mrkishi: I'm pretty sure the example is correct

[10:16:37.0652] <mrkishi>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> mrkishi: I'm pretty sure the example is correct

what's your interpretation of this, then?

> If the character reference was consumed as part of an attribute, and the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), and the next input character is either a U+003D EQUALS SIGN character (=) or an ASCII alphanumeric, then, for historical reasons, flush code points consumed as a character reference and switch to the return state.
> 
> Otherwise:

and where is the `&amp;`, `&apos;` and `&quot;` exceptions handled?

[10:17:12.0041] <annevk>
Well, you need to start with the first paragraph of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#named-character-reference-state

[10:17:50.0255] <annevk>
For `&notit;` that gives you `not` in the table, as the example says. So you have a match.

[10:18:15.0567] <annevk>
But say you're parsing an attribute it won't work as it doesn't end in `;`

[10:18:35.0250] <annevk>
But if the input was `&quot;` it would, since that does end in `;`

[10:18:37.0844] <mrkishi>
oh, i'm an idiot.

[10:19:02.0615] <mrkishi>
this whole time i thought not's named reference was `&notit;`

[10:19:03.0785] <annevk>
Well, I wouldn't go that far; reading specifications is a skill you need to learn

[10:20:00.0952] <mrkishi>
> <@annevk:mozilla.org> Well, I wouldn't go that far; reading specifications is a skill you need to learn

i have some other pretty convincing rationale, but i'll spare you the details

[10:20:05.0806] <annevk>
And even then it can be involved 🙂

[10:20:25.0983] <mrkishi>

looking at https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/15030, to test `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`, any advice on how I can emulate a system without a camera and microphone?

[17:08:59.0092] <sideshowbarker>
I want to make `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` throw a `NotFoundError` error at (I guess) step 9.3.1 of https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia

[17:11:14.0894] <miketayl_r>
sideshowbarker: you might send `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=()` and try in chrome

[17:11:20.0453] <miketayl_r>
in theory that should work

[17:11:47.0972] <miketayl_r>
(maybe it throws some other error tho... like NotAllowedError)

[17:12:09.0534] <miketayl_r>
hm, step 11 suggests that

[17:12:18.0768] <sideshowbarker>
thanks — will try it

[17:12:36.0685] <miketayl_r>
sideshowbarker: it looks like it should throw the wrong error

[17:12:43.0083] <sideshowbarker>
ah OK, yeah

[17:12:48.0672] <sideshowbarker>
 * ah OK, yeah

[17:12:57.0910] <miketayl_r>
next up: get a screwdriver... :P

[17:16:46.0923] <sideshowbarker>
I thought maybe I could change my OS system settings on my laptop to completely disable my microphone and camera — but macOS at least does not provide a way to do that, as far as I can see

[17:17:43.0404] <miketayl_r>
hmmm

[17:18:21.0703] <sideshowbarker>
ah wait, maybe this: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-to-the-microphone-on-mac-mchla1b1e1fe/mac

[17:18:31.0303] <miketayl_r>
this kinda looks like the right thing to poke at

[17:18:34.0596] <sideshowbarker>
yeah, that :)

[17:18:39.0767] <miketayl_r>
good idea

[17:18:51.0370] <sideshowbarker>
will try it

[17:19:17.0492] <sideshowbarker>
hope it’s reversible 😆

[17:22:06.0803] <sideshowbarker>
incidentally, I notice that Element/Matrix now have (beta) support for (Slack-like) threaded replies/conversations

[17:22:20.0548] <sideshowbarker>
wonder how long that’s been there

[17:22:57.0162] <miketayl_r>
oh, interesting

[17:23:52.0042] <sideshowbarker>
OK yeah, that worked 🎉 I got it to throw the `NotFoundError` I wanted

[17:57:25.0114] <sideshowbarker>
OK, raised https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/15038 — thanks much, miketayl_r

[21:03:13.0235] <sideshowbarker>
looking at https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/15129 — when `setTimeout(handler, timeout, ...arguments)` is called with a _timeout_ that’s not a number, what spec defines how it gets coerced into a number?

[21:04:24.0783] <sideshowbarker>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/timers-and-user-prompts.html#timer-initialisation-steps says nothing about coercing _timeout_ to a number but instead assumes it’s already a number

[21:29:48.0138] <sideshowbarker>
I guess somehow I end up at https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#abstract-opdef-converttoint

[23:56:38.0532] <arai>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#windoworworkerglobalscope-mixin says the definition is `long setTimeout(TimerHandler handler, optional long timeout = 0, any... arguments);`

[23:57:16.0163] <arai>
so, the conversion defined in https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#es-long happens

[02:27:48.0528] <sideshowbarker>
OK, so then for a string like `"1 second"`, I think ultimately that:

1. calls into the ES spec at https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/abstract-operations.html#sec-stringtonumber, which then:
2. calls into https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-source-code.html#sec-parsetext with`ParseText(_text_, _StringNumericLiteral_)` — which for a string like `"1 second"` fails to be parsed as a _StringNumericLiteral_, and instead returns a List of errors, and so then:
3. we reach step 3 at https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/abstract-operations.html#sec-stringtonumber, “If _literal_ is a List of errors, return **NaN**.“
4. we go back to https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#abstract-opdef-converttoint and hit step 8, “If _x_ is **NaN**, +0, +∞, or −∞, then return +0“

Does that sound right?

I'm the kind of person who had noticed months ago that nested worker termination when the parent worker closes is wonky in the spec, but put it off as "not that important" months ago... but got nerd-sniped into opening that bug right now in order to justify a minor point in a different issue

[05:19:57.0424] <Jake Archibald>
Does anyone know the history of `DOMContentLoaded`, as in, why is it named using a different pattern to other events?

[05:23:30.0399] <Jake Archibald>
I guess the mattern started with mutation events in DOM-level-2

[05:48:59.0127] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: yeah, there was a group of people that thought we should prefix and case event names in that manner, see also DOMFocusIn and the like

[05:49:37.0424] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: I suspect it had strong overlap with the Java people, but I don't know for sure, predates me

[15:19:34.0660] <sideshowbarker>
TabAtkins: In MDN, for https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap/ we now have a bunch of links with broken fragments.


[15:20:08.0146] <sideshowbarker>
So I notice that, e.g., the anchor at https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap/#scroll-padding no longer exists.
But I see it at https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap-1/#scroll-padding.
So I guess the cause must be that the https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap/ alias was recently changed to point to the https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap-2 spec rather than the https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap-1/ spec.

[15:21:31.0523] <sideshowbarker>
I don’t understand why the Level 2 spec doesn’t have those same parts from the Level 1 spec.
Is the Level 2 spec a delta spec or something?

[15:22:34.0339] <sideshowbarker>
At MDN we have a policy of using the level-less URLs for all https://drafts.csswg.org/ specs (or really, for leveled specs in general)

[15:22:53.0196] <sideshowbarker>
 * I don’t understand why the Level 2 spec doesn’t have those same parts from the Level 1 spec.
Is the Level 2 spec a delta spec or something?

[15:25:51.0752] <sideshowbarker>
…except in cases (like this one, I guess) where the leveled version which a level-less URL points to lacks some parts/anchors for features documented in MDN that are in some (earlier or later) leveled version

[15:30:37.0262] <sideshowbarker>
So I could fix the broken-fragments problem in this case by updating MDN to use the Level 1, e.g., https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap-1/#scroll-padding URLs, but there’s a lot of them that broke — about 25.
And I guess that means there are at least 25 features that are in the Level 1 spec that are missing from the Level 2 spec — which kind of makes me wonder why the https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap/ alias was changed to point to the Level 2 spec.
 

[15:31:19.0330] <sideshowbarker>
TabAtkins: So I wonder if maybe the https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scroll-snap/ alias could be changed back to pointing to the Level 1 spec rather than the Level 2 spec?

[15:43:04.0277] <TabAtkins>
Yup it should be, I've just adjusted it

[15:43:11.0948] <TabAtkins>
Thanks for the catch

[15:44:03.0200] <TabAtkins>
(we shouldn't be pointing the unleveled aliases at delta specs, please report if you catch us doing that)

> <@tabatkins:matrix.org> (we shouldn't be pointing the unleveled aliases at delta specs, please report if you catch us doing that)

will do — pretty sure that for now was the only current one (otherwise my mdn-spec-links build automation would catch it, which is what happened in this case), but definitely will give a heads-up if/when I never run into another one

[17:58:52.0042] <Seirdy>
Bit confused about `aria-labelledby` versus `aria-describedby` wrt `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`. reading MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Figure_Role), it says that `aria-describedby` is for long captions and `aria-labelledby` is for short captions, but we should use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` instead. If the figure caption is a wee bit long (say, >150 characters), does it switch from being a label to a description? Firefox's accessibility tree doesn't seem to indicate so, and neither did the HTML Living Standard when I checked.
Some of my captions start with something like "Code Snippet 4 (shell): ...", and then comes a longer description. I'd ideally want to make everything before the colon the "label" and the full caption the description (or maybe just everything after the colon?).
I hope I'm not being too "clever" by breaking the first rule of ARIA, but it seems like plain HTML really doesn't handle the distinction between labels and descriptions when using "figure" elements.

[07:57:43.0881] <Domenic>
Seirdy: have you tried testing with a screen reader? I'm not sure screen reader users actually benefit from having both label (thing before the :) and description (thing after the :). Just a longer description would work better for them IIRC.

[08:47:39.0590] <Seirdy>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> Seirdy: have you tried testing with a screen reader? I'm not sure screen reader users actually benefit from having both label (thing before the :) and description (thing after the :). Just a longer description would work better for them IIRC.

Good point. Though I should try testing with different verbosity levels too...

[08:57:52.0095] <Seirdy>
yeah it looks like Orca does understand the difference but doesn't read the description by default when the label is provided.

[08:58:50.0562] <Seirdy>
hang on, i think there's more. gimme a sec...

[09:02:38.0000] <Seirdy>
ok i got it:

[09:02:53.0447] <Seirdy>
orca understands "everything before the colon" is the aria-label and reads it first.

[09:03:05.0163] <Seirdy>
then orca reads the entire figcaption.

[09:03:12.0664] <Seirdy>
(including everything before the colon)

[09:03:19.0953] <Seirdy>
so there's some repetition.

[09:04:13.0371] <Seirdy>
Now, I have like 20 code snippets on this page so I want people to be able to quickly identify them using a short label rather than the full caption. So I don't wanna give up on the concept of a label shorter than the "full description".

[09:04:55.0899] <Seirdy>
semantically I think the right thing to do would be to make "everything before the colon" a heading.

[09:06:05.0940] <Seirdy>
visually i might have to mess with CSS a bit to make that "look right" and not look like a new subsection of the article (i.e. look like a figure).

[09:07:06.0595] <Seirdy>
ideally "everything before the colon" would not get is own newline, so i could just break the first rule of ARIA and give the pre-colon text a role="heading" 😈

[09:24:08.0095] <Seirdy>
huh apparently if you navigate to a figure landmark, orca will read the label (which is the caption) and then enter the figure and  includi including the caption. the caption gets read twice. making "before the colon" the aria-label has improved this.

[09:24:53.0868] <Seirdy>
idk why i didn't think to actually follow SR behavior before, i got too caught up in theory. Thanks for the reality check Domenic! Seirdy out, for now.

[10:19:49.0165] <smaug>
Domenic: I guess in my mind NavigationTransition or some such would be the object which the event had a pointer to and once event dispatch was done, Navigation.transition would point to that (if navigation would proceed). So effectively this object which tells about transition would be created before, not after, the event dispatch and event dispatching is used to tell how the transition should work by modifying that object. 

[10:20:17.0972] <Domenic>
Hmm, well, the idea behind the name transition was that it only exists if you call transitionWhile().

[10:49:30.0462] <smaug>
But it is an object created for navigation and whether or not Navigation.transition ends up pointing to it is a separate thing.

emilio: so what's the viewport of `new Document()`? The viewport of its relevant global object or some such?

[04:47:22.0201] <emilio>
annevk: I think viewports of documents which have no rendering are generally 0x0

[04:47:34.0723] <emilio>
annevk: display: none iframes are another example

[04:48:42.0231] <annevk>
I see what you mean with the `matchMedia()` remark now. Okay, so code exists, unclear if it's defined

[04:49:41.0261] <annevk>
And abstracting/duplicating that logic for workers is not something you see the value in

[04:50:40.0839] <annevk>
Seems we might need something for `letterSpacing` too

[04:51:28.0069] <annevk>
And `wordSpacing`

[04:52:02.0991] <emilio>
yeah, I looked into it and it was rather annoying, in the sense that you either get all the viewport sizes upfront and pass them around (which slows down absolute length resolution), or make a bunch of that stuff virtual, which is also not-great, and adds another abstraction layer just for this

[04:52:26.0688] <emilio>
(same for stuff like font-metrics, inherited font family, etc)

[04:52:54.0940] <emilio>
So it is either a bunch of stuff to pack upfront, or a silly abstraction layer to have (imo)

[04:53:20.0580] <emilio>
Specially since it's not like it does something useful, like on the main-thread case

[04:53:37.0493] <emilio>
It's just fixing a 0x0 viewport with a 10px sans font

[04:53:59.0998] <annevk>
Yeah, even if it makes some code more portable it doesn't seem entirely likely that you'd always expect a 10px font or a 0x0 viewport for that matter

[04:54:32.0650] <annevk>
And even if there was some magical future with elements in workers they wouldn't become reference points for OffscreenCanvas

[08:49:36.0685] <annevk>
Media elements are so weird

I presume what's intended is "the object doesn't contain any of the defined dictionary keys"

[14:39:32.0122] <TabAtkins>
I don't understand why that spec text is adding that condition, tho, since all the text under that step just explicitly tests for key presence.

[18:19:08.0196] <Justin Martin>
Is there any mechanism to enforce subresource integrity upon a document, such that one can know that a document-like entity (e.g. an iframe or Document object) was initialized from a resource with a given content hash?

[22:16:11.0985] <annevk>
Justin Martin: no and no plans for that either at this point that I know of

[08:37:30.0389] <annevk>
Domenic: to be clear, I agree that ideally <link rel=preload> does not do type-specific fetching, but how is it not a layering violation for `fetch()` to act on `Link` headers? At that point it would no longer be the lowest-level primitive we could offer. Definitely seems counter to its design goals.

[08:38:26.0624] <Domenic>
fetch() is already not the lowest-level primitive; it builds on top of HTTP which has a bunch of header-triggered behaviors (including further fetches), like Location, CORS, etc.

[08:39:20.0128] <Domenic>
Link being another one of those seems reasonable to me; there's a bit of an IETF/WHATWG mess where IETF doesn't have the toolbox to specify Link caches in proper detail but that's fine, we can do it.

[08:39:41.0566] <Domenic>
(We already have to specify things like Location redirect limits)

[08:40:18.0246] <annevk>
The Link header is not part of HTTP proper though, Location is.

[08:40:32.0537] <Domenic>
I think that's just a SDO split and does not reflect any interesting architecture

[08:41:16.0688] <annevk>
It's the same SDO and that SDO has pulled in headers that are part of the core HTTP architecture into HTTP, so I'm not really sure you understand the setup...

[08:41:45.0567] <Domenic>
I think I understand the IETF's desired setup. I don't think it matches how the web actually works in browsers.

[08:41:56.0540] <Domenic>
Or how it is experienced by web developers

[08:42:25.0751] <Domenic>
I don't think any web developer thinks of Link and Location and X-Content-Type-Options and Access-Control-Allow-Origin as on different layers of the stack.

[08:42:38.0532] <Domenic>
And I don't think they should have to

[08:42:53.0570] <Domenic>
And I don't think that reflects any implementation split (in web browsers at least)

[08:43:40.0457] <annevk>
Web browsers actually have that kind of split quite a bit (and match Fetch far less than would be ideal)

[08:44:16.0467] <Domenic>
That is not my understanding of the Chromium and Gecko codebases.

[08:44:31.0397] <annevk>
I agree that web developers might perceive things differently

[08:44:35.0276] <Domenic>
The main split there is renderer vs. browser/network processes

[08:44:55.0636] <Domenic>
And that largely has to do with whether stuff should or needs to be accessible to the main thread

[08:45:17.0613] <Domenic>
E.g. ACAO (Fetch-level, not HTTP-level) stays in the network stack, and this helps against Spectre defenses.

[08:45:46.0219] <annevk>
Both Chrome and Gecko wrap network code with a bunch of Fetch thingies

[08:46:07.0003] <Domenic>
Yep, but their headers are implemented all over the place, e.g. a lot of stuff supposedly in Fetch is in the network code.

[08:46:35.0967] <Domenic>
The layering is not based on specs, it's based on security mostly.

[08:46:39.0524] <annevk>
And some of it has shifted over time, that's fair, but I don't think browsers necessarily represent an ideal architecture either 🙂

[08:47:14.0535] <Domenic>
For sure, I don't think there is a single ideal architecture, it depends on your goals. Security vs. aligning with web developer expectations vs. writing well-factored specs across SDO boundaries are all different goals.

It'd be interesting to know if web developers expect `Link` headers to take effect when you use `fetch()`

[08:48:02.0148] <Domenic>
+1

[08:48:24.0838] <annevk>
I suspect they wouldn't expect that when using it in Deno or Node.js and I kinda doubt they expect it from browsers, but who knows

[08:48:39.0115] <Luca Casonato>
+1

[08:48:47.0325] <Domenic>
Deno has some similar stuff for import(), but yeah I dunno about fetch().

[08:49:03.0376] <Domenic>
(It'll auto-fetch types based on certain headers.)

[08:49:04.0848] <Luca Casonato>
What would `Link` headers in fetch even do?

[08:49:15.0936] <Domenic>
preload and preconnect

[08:49:30.0863] <Luca Casonato>
ah

[08:49:31.0189] <Domenic>
and modulepreload

[08:50:27.0614] <Luca Casonato>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> (It'll auto-fetch types based on certain headers.)

Yup, but I think most folks understand that as happening in the module loader, not on the http layer (it is an additional parallel request unlike `Location` which redirects the current chain of fetches)

[08:51:28.0412] <Luca Casonato>
I think most devs expect `fetch` et al (low level network primitives) to be relatively stateless. Ie they don't go and trigger something to happen out of bounds that you can't really observe

[08:53:20.0854] <annevk>
(I also don't think that the layering in browsers is necessarily based on security. A lot of it is just "happened to be easy to do this way". There's some higher-level layering that's for security reasons, but a lot of the decisions within a single security "zone" are rather arbitrary. And sometimes confusing, with both the networking and application code parsing the same header.)

[08:55:27.0201] <Domenic>
I'll say that on Chromium parts the layering is extremely security-motivated; we have multiple year+ projects to move things between processes and parts of the codebase for security.

[08:55:29.0315] <Luca Casonato>
FWIW, i don't think `fetch` should respect preload or preconnect. it makes for very confusing debugging if a server can trigger an additional background fetch by just setting a header on the response imo

[08:55:47.0952] <Domenic>
Maybe that's just us though

[08:55:47.0955] <Luca Casonato>

Domenic: that's the higher-level layering

[08:57:09.0340] <Domenic>
I'm not sure how many "levels of layering" you have in mind, but I think we don't conceptualize the Chromium codebase that way at least :)

[09:01:43.0208] <Luca Casonato>
No, we also maintain this split between privileged and unprivileged sides in Deno. But it's a really tricky thing for this networking stuff, because there are so many interconnected pieces that all operate on slightly different layers of the system. Any time any of these layers can have side effects, it makes for much much more complex implementation because then we may need to jump from deep inside of trusted code, back into untrusted code.

[09:49:51.0001] <annevk>
Luca Casonato: for the multipart issue, Domenic was playing with `multipart/x-mixed-replace`; from your response it seems you are not?

[09:50:10.0218] <annevk>
(Context: https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1021.)

[09:51:44.0074] <Domenic>
Yeah, multipart/form-data is extremely different from multipart/x-mixed-replace

[09:52:49.0542] <Domenic>
Also I don't see why we would close the issue? We didn't satisfy the feature request of adding a native TransformStream for multipart responses...

[10:19:30.0633] <TabAtkins>
> <@domenicdenicola:matrix.org> I don't think any web developer thinks of Link and Location and X-Content-Type-Options and Access-Control-Allow-Origin as on different layers of the stack.

As a web dev, I had no idea that was even possibly a thing that could be true. All the headers are partitioned into "something something HTTP" in my head.

[10:20:48.0694] <legostarwars_saga>
hello

[10:52:17.0029] <Luca Casonato>
Domenic annevk my bad. I only skimmed over the issue. Disregard my comment. 

[11:03:47.0819] <TabAtkins>
What is the purpose of the "type name" thing in WebIDL? Afaict it's not used *anywhere* in the spec; the only references to it are things defining what their type names are. Is this just some weird legacy thing dating back to when WebIDL pretended it was useful for Java, and we've kept it going out of inertia?

[11:12:04.0199] <annevk>
TabAtkins: blame points to https://github.com/whatwg/webidl/commit/8e66595d495b40d05c9926fbd01b0fa0be5ecb6a, but I wasn't able to figure it out based on that (perhaps there's some corresponding email or some such)

[11:14:09.0687] <TabAtkins>
thanks for tracking it down, I agree that the commit doesn't provide enough context. I'll ping @heycam, thanks!

[11:16:49.0319] <TabAtkins>
Oohhhhhhh, it was used for the old `T[]` syntax that produced Array subclasses; it would name the subclass accordingly.

[11:17:01.0888] <TabAtkins>
Its' the final mention of the term "type name" in that commit.

[11:17:29.0583] <TabAtkins>
okay, opening a bug to discuss removing it

should localstorage instances called on windows between iframes still work?

[17:33:08.0185] <devsnek>
i found an interesting bit of js that works around a website deleting localStorage by creating an iframe and setting window.localStorage from iframe.contentWindow.localStorage

 * i found an interesting bit of js that works around a website deleting localStorage by creating an iframe and setting window.localStorage from iframe.contentWindow.localStorage

[17:54:56.0916] <Domenic>
That seems reasonable, we generally don't inspect callstacks in web specs at least

[19:57:58.0056] <devsnek>
yeah i just wasn't sure if it was some sort of like, branding thing that was broken. if it comes down to call stacks the behavior seems reasonable.

[23:37:55.0092] <annevk>
devsnek: web platform brands are cross-realm

[00:15:21.0048] <sideshowbarker>
what’s a “brand” in this context? Never heard the term used as such, and I don’t find it in the ES spec, so I guess it’s coined somewhere else?

[00:21:31.0920] <sideshowbarker>
/me finds _“Passes various brand checks”_ in code comment in the WebIDL spec, but no reference anywhere to what a “brand” is

[00:22:21.0519] <Ms2ger 💉💉>
https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#implements , basically

[00:22:36.0624] <sideshowbarker>
/me looks

[00:23:34.0802] <sideshowbarker>
thanks — so I guess “brand” and “brand check” are some informal terms for that?

[00:26:55.0302] <sideshowbarker>
OK, finally found https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/main/terminology.md#brand-check

[00:27:12.0424] <sideshowbarker>
> Brand check ("brand" as in a mark, or a brand made with a branding iron) is a term used by TC39 to describe a check against a unique datatype whose creation is controlled by a piece of code.

[00:48:44.0436] <annevk>
sideshowbarker: yeah, it's basically some internal slot that only implementers can set and inspect which prevents emulating the object in pure JS (it can often be observed through side effects of various features)

[01:46:41.0790] <zcorpan>
Do we care about unrelated drive-by fixes being in their own PRs? https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/7829/files#diff-41cf6794ba4200b839c53531555f0f3998df4cbb01a4d5cb0b94e3ca5e23947dL75618

[02:18:24.0860] <annevk>
zcorpan: it depends, wording nits and whitespace changes are fine, if it becomes a large part of the PR it's probably best split

[05:35:40.0580] <zcorpan>
annevk: ok, I guess this markup fix is small and therefore no need to split

[08:26:53.0268] <annevk>
Yeah, a markup fix should  be fine

[08:53:51.0496] <Domenic>
Yeah my criteria is a mix of "Is the diff really confusing when you smash them into one PR" and "would people really want to see this in the GitHub commit log". So like, removing that one <td> line does not create a confusing diff and would be a bit silly to see while browsing the commit log. Whereas, if you reindent a big algorithm that is only slightly related to the part of the spec you're changing, that is worth a separate commit.

[09:52:57.0748] <smaug>
readonly attribute Uint8Array data;  that isn't anything magical and can't be null or undefined, right?  

[09:58:34.0995] <annevk>
smaug: yup

[09:58:59.0055] <smaug>
nm, found the existing bug about midi events 🙂 https://github.com/WebAudio/web-midi-api/issues/168

[09:59:54.0265] <annevk>
"Basic" details of events are hard, film at 11

[10:01:32.0173] <smaug>
Implementing what is spec'ed is hard. (turns out a crash in Gecko's midi impl happens because of this). If one would have tried to implement what is spec'ed, the spec would have been fixed long ago 🙂

[10:03:25.0996] <annevk>
Browsers are hard; let's go shopping. See y'all tomorrow.

[13:53:43.0767] <Domenic>
annevk: smaug: do I recall Firefox trying to implement https://wicg.github.io/page-lifecycle/ ? Trying to figure out the maintenance story for that as apparently I am an editor... and in particular wondering if we should move it into HTML or not.

[14:34:16.0972] <smaug>
I'm not aware of any implementation plans for that

[14:35:03.0526] <smaug>
Would need to re-review it again now that Fission is shipping and bfcache handling is a tiny bit different because of that.

[14:35:33.0524] <smaug>
(page lifecycle API used to have issues with bfcache, but I think most of them were resolved )

[15:59:40.0194] <Domenic>
OK, maybe I just remembered all of your reviews and pointing out those issues.

[16:00:24.0787] <Domenic>
Will plan on keeping it in WICG... and in particular put it on the list of things to rebase on https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6315

[18:20:19.0619] <Peter Silva>
hello there, wondering how to proceed to get html to add "base" as a link relation, corresponding to the BASE element in html.  Where would I go to start such a discussion?

[23:08:21.0367] <annevk>
smaug: I think we used to have plans, but yeah, at this point we should probably review it first

[23:08:55.0943] <annevk>
Domenic: if you have time, Import Maps cleanup would be much higher priority for us as I understand it (cc yulia)

[23:13:50.0156] <annevk>

This would be nice to do, as we are almost done our implementation

[04:01:38.0780] <zcorpan>
TabAtkins: https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/1071 still gets a link error from bikeshed. What gives?

[04:40:56.0959] <annevk>
zcorpan: it could be that the scraper thingie is down, happens a lot

annevk: ok

[07:33:16.0110] <Domenic>
> <@yulia:mozilla.org> This would be nice to do, as we are almost done our implementation

For sure, I can prioritize that in the next week or two. I'll strip out external support and try to get it merged into HTML.

No, although I created a new class="props" in a PR which you can see at https://whatpr.org/html/6315/history.html#snapshotting-source-snapshot-params , which I was planning to add to Bikeshed at some point

[12:28:08.0640] <Domenic>
zcorpan: for the blog I was able to use a workaround of looking at their password myself and communicating over personal email. Is that possible for the wiki?

[12:33:58.0504] <zcorpan>
Domenic: I don't know how mediawiki stores passwords

[12:34:24.0694] <Domenic>
I guess my question is what other options are there besides "Use a temporary random password and send it to the specified email address"

[12:39:44.0045] <zcorpan>
The account is created already, and the wiki generated a password (but didn't send any email). As far as I can tell, there's no web interface to remove accounts. But someone who can edit the database could remove the account and then we can create a new account and choose a password

[12:40:44.0524] <zcorpan>
The username is "Stevenwadejr"

[12:53:11.0980] <Domenic>
OK, well, I don't really know how to edit the database but I think I can figure it out (the credentials are on the DigitalOcean control panel). And since this is my fault I'll give it a shot.

[13:14:48.0919] <Domenic>
zcorpan: I think I did it

[13:15:15.0236] <zcorpan>
Domenic: thanks!

[13:37:51.0581] <zcorpan>
Domenic: so I created a new account with the same username and a chosen password. But the confirmation page said "The user account for Unknown user (talk) has been created." .... and it's not possible to log in :-/ Trying to create the account again it says the username already exists

[13:38:55.0614] <Domenic>
Maybe you have to mess with more than the user's table :( :(
