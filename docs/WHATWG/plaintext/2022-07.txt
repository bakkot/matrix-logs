Hi! I recently joined a company that already signed the participation agreement - How do I make https://participate.whatwg.org/agreement-status?user=nicolo-ribaudo&repo=html pick it up, rather than being stuck on a non-verified signature I submitted last year?

annevk: is there anything in the websocket spec that still requires what this test is testing? http://wpt.live/websockets/constructor/014.html (i.e. to wait with establishing another websocket connection to the same host while the previous is still connecting, as a DOS prevention mechanism)

[07:57:05.0009] <Yutaka Hirano>
zcorpan: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-4.1 

[07:57:40.0307] <Yutaka Hirano>
If the client already has a WebSocket connection to the remote
host (IP address) identified by /host/ and port /port/ pair, even
if the remote host is known by another name, the client MUST wait
until that connection has been established or for that connection
to have failed.  There MUST be no more than one connection in a
CONNECTING state.

[07:57:44.0433] <Yutaka Hirano>
Maybe this?

[07:58:20.0905] <zcorpan>
Yutaka Hirano: Thanks! Yes. I thought it was defined in the API rather than the protocol

[07:59:25.0189] <zcorpan>
It shouldn't delay the first connection though, but maybe browsers have to wait a microtask or a task to avoid race conditions?

[07:59:40.0700] <zcorpan>
Context: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/8037

[08:05:20.0928] <Yutaka Hirano>
zcorpan: Interesting! As long as the connection establishment is fast enough, subsequent WebSocket connections will not be suffered, right?

[08:07:34.0880] <zcorpan>
Yutaka Hirano: The delaying while connecting applies equally for all subsequent connections

[08:09:05.0964] <zcorpan>
Yutaka Hirano: but I mean, for the first connection, there is no prior connection, so no reason for the browser to wait. But how does the browser know for sure that a connection is the first one, without incurring any delay for the first connection? The "establish a WebSocket connection" steps are defined to be in parallel

[08:09:48.0003] <zcorpan>
Also with the guarantee to never violate the requirement

[08:12:04.0790] <Yutaka Hirano>
@zcorpan: Our implementation runs all the websocket network activities on the same sequence, though It is different from the scripting sequence.

[08:13:08.0876] <Yutaka Hirano>
zcorpan: Thus it is easy for us to distinguish the "first" request (for a server).

[08:13:40.0036] <Yutaka Hirano>
 * @zcorpan: Our implementation runs all the websocket network activities on the same sequence, though It is different from the scripting sequence.

[08:15:48.0977] <zcorpan>
Yutaka Hirano: is strelec's claim "I think that the remainder of the main thread execution delays the connection to the socket (if not according to the spec, then by browser implementations)" true in chromium? That is, does the script that calls the WebSocket constructor need to complete before the network connection is started?

[08:18:54.0037] <Yutaka Hirano>
zcorpan: Sorry, what do you mean by "complete"?

[08:19:53.0597] <Yutaka Hirano>
Due to "in parallel", `new WebSocket(...)` returns immediately. The network connection will be done later.

[08:22:39.0435] <zcorpan>
Yutaka Hirano: the sync part of the script is run, e.g. in `<script>const ws = new WebSocket(url); ws.onopen = handleOpen; await new Promise(resolve => resolve())</script>` after the onopen handler is registered but before the promise has resolved

[08:23:47.0288] <zcorpan>
The question is how much later, and does it depend on when the "script" is done?

[08:25:48.0576] <Yutaka Hirano>
zcorpan: In our implentation, the script completes immediately. The WebSocket constructor kicks the connection procedure in another sequence ("the network thread"). The waiting behavior is implemented in the network thread. Does this answer your question?

[08:27:57.0333] <zcorpan>
Yutaka Hirano: I think so. It sounds like strelec's claim is then not correct (for chromium). To verify, I could do `alert(true) {}` right after the WebSocket constructor, and the browser would still open a connection from the network thread while the main thread is busy running the infinite loop?

[08:29:24.0380] <Yutaka Hirano>
zcorpan: Yes, the connection will be established, but the script wouldn't be able to know that because the `onopen` handler is blocked by the busy loop.

[08:29:55.0820] <zcorpan>
Yutaka Hirano: right. Thanks!

[08:30:33.0869] <Yutaka Hirano>

 * zcorpan: Hello, once again.

[11:11:40.0766] <The Freelancer>
I wanted to ask one question regarding the DOM, which has been confusing me for a while...

[11:15:50.0809] <The Freelancer>
Why does querySelectorAll() return a NodeList and not an HTMLCollection instance?

[11:16:48.0929] <The Freelancer>
The reasoning I have here is that querySelectorAll() is meant to select elements only, and the HTMLCollection interface suits this notion more than NodeList...

[11:17:28.0121] <The Freelancer>
NodeList, as the documentation says, is a collection of nodes. For example, for the childNodes property of an element, it makes perfect sense, as it will contain element nodes, text nodes, maybe even comment nodes.

[11:18:30.0516] <The Freelancer>
But for querySelectorAll(), using NodeList doesn't make sense, as far as I see it. Clearly, there is some story related to using NodeList for querySelectorAll()...

[14:40:10.0806] <zcorpan>
> <@bro2000:matrix.org> zcorpan: Hello, once again.

Hi! I found this thread from a decade ago where this was discussed. https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2012JanMar/thread.html#msg7 Back then some browsers returned HTMLCollection and some returned NodeList. HTMLCollection was not yet part of the DOM spec (so the spec layering  concern applied). Also, HTMLCollection has a  named getter which NodeList does not, and nobody likes  these "magic" named getters (but web  compat might  depend on them).

[14:40:46.0799] <zcorpan>
As for making sense, please  see the topic :)

[14:41:51.0945] <zcorpan>
Both kinds of collections are legacy now, see https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#old-style-collections

[14:43:19.0728] <zcorpan>
and the note in https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-htmlcollection

[14:45:56.0865] <zcorpan>
(The thread  wasn't about querySelectorAll actually, I see now)

[14:56:01.0359] <zcorpan>
The first Working Draft of  Selectors API defined the return value to be StaticNodeList rather than NodeList because NodeLists were  defined to be  live in DOM  3  Core. https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-selectors-api-20060525/#staticnodelist 


2022-07-05
[23:53:10.0764] <The Freelancer>
zcorpan: I still don't understand the intuition behind this decision. I have read the resources that you pointed out, but still things are vague. There must be some reason to use NodeList for querySelectorAll(), or otherwise it was just a bad design decision...

[00:12:52.0489] <annevk>
I'm going to let testsuite.org expire. If anyone here wants it let me know.

[01:00:48.0025] <freddy>

[04:39:07.0776] <Noam Rosenthal>
annevk: if you're around can you review https://github.com/whatwg/xhr/pull/347 when you have time? thanks!

[11:23:26.0914] <zcorpan>
The Freelancer: I don't really know, don't recall if HTMLCollection was ever proposed for querySelectorAll. Maybe at the time, HTMLCollection was seen as a HTML-specific thing while qSA can return any element, so NodeList seemed more appropriate

[11:24:11.0995] <zcorpan>
The Freelancer: if we were to design it today, the return type would probably be `sequence<Element>`

[11:38:22.0838] <The Freelancer>
No problem 🙂. Just thought maybe you knew of it.
I don't get why browsers shifted from using NodeList for getElementsByTagName() and getElementsByClassName() to using HTMLCollection. I went through the resource that you provided from 2012. It contained a couple of chat messages related to this, but I couldn't understand its purpose still.

[11:39:57.0570] <The Freelancer>
zcorpan: I learnt that one thing that irritated browser developers was the fact that HTMLCollection had a namedItem() method. Do you have any knowledge about this?


2022-07-07
[23:41:29.0409] <annevk>
The Freelancer: `namedItem()` is not the problem, but the corresponding getter (Web IDL, special operation) is. That allows for easy confusion between elements of the collection and members of the collection object instance due to the way JavaScript works.

[01:05:19.0036] <The Freelancer>
annevk: I didn't understand what you said. If you don't mind, can you please elaborate it a bit further....

[03:15:12.0924] <annevk>
The Freelancer: say you have an element whose ID is `length` that is part of `collection`; what does `collection["length"]` return?

[04:20:57.0140] <The Freelancer>
Ok, great. Now, I get that.

[04:21:06.0914] <The Freelancer>
annevk: So HTMLCollection doesn't have this problem, right?

Hello! I'm reading the whatwg/html spec, and I'm confused by the difference between the [running script](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#running-script) and the [active script](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#active-script). Is it possible that they are always the same thing?

[11:52:44.0854] <jschoi>
nicolo-ribaudo: I don’t remember for sure, but I kind of remember that there are times when the topmost element of the execution context stack (i.e., the running execution context) is null, right? That’s the key question here.

Aren't both the running script and the active script null in that case?


2022-07-08
[22:47:14.0033] <annevk>
The Freelancer: it does

[02:50:15.0887] <zcorpan>
The Freelancer: HTMLCollection has the problem but NodeList does not. The reason some browsers switched from NodeList to HTMLCollection anyway is for web compatibility. Some websites depended on collection.foobar working.

[09:19:04.0966] <jschoi>
nicolo-ribaudo: There are brief times when the running execution context’s ScriptOrModule is null, right? For example, step 7 of https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-built-in-function-objects-call-thisargument-argumentslist. 



[09:19:20.0577] <jschoi>
Also, hosts have leeway in what kind of execution contexts they are allowed to push onto the stack: https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-hostresolveimportedmodule

> An example of when referencingScriptOrModule can be null is in a web browser host. There, if a user clicks on a control given by `<button type="button" onclick="import('./foo.mjs')">Click me</button>`

[03:11:35.0915] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh well, I guess that the definition of running script just doesn't work in that case, so it's not null but ill-defined

[19:06:18.0971] <Domenic>
sideshowbarker: yeah no idea, that's before my time. Maybe just because it's giant and there was some concern about vertical space? Maybe it used to be multiple columns? Improving the styling would be great there, especially if we can multicol it.

PSA: FYI for anybody who’s been frustrated — or had your work blocked — by the almost-daily https://drafts.csswg.org outages: Today I raised https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7500 to suggest it’s time to consider replacing the backend with something known to be much more reliable (and doesn’t require funding for a person-month of engineering effort to make happen) — namely the https://andreubotella.com/csswg-auto-build/ setup.

I didn’t raise the issue as a troll and it’s not meant to be hostile or provocative — I went out of my way to try to word it as diplomatically as possible — but instead it’s a good-faith effort to try to start a constructive discussion about the problem and the requirements and about one possible solution to consider.

It's because the code was written years ago and various things have bitrotted, plus it gets *way* more spam/spider traffic now than it did when it was first stood up. He hasn't had time to do updates on it in his free time; "keeping it up" is just repeatedly kicking the server when something's crashed.

[09:55:36.0946] <TabAtkins>
But yeah there's a contract going thru the corp machinery to actually pay Peter for his time to get it all refreshed and up to date

[09:56:16.0968] <TabAtkins>
And as Peter said, "just" fixing the front-end specs will just leave the rest of the infrastructure rotting *even worse*, so we're not avoiding anything meaningful by jumping ahead of the work.

Hello guys.

[07:31:11.0476] <The Freelancer>
I have a question related to the DOM standard.

[07:34:37.0319] <The Freelancer>
That is: **why are the `appendChild()` and `insertBefore()` methods defined on the Node interface, when they only work for `Document`, `DocumentFragment` and `Element` instances?** I mean, the methods could've otherwise been defined on the [ParentNode](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-parentnode) mixin as used in the spec which is included by Document, DocumentFragment and Element

[07:35:03.0434] <The Freelancer>
Is there any particular reason for defining these methods on the `Node` interface?

[17:46:49.0550] <Domenic>
> <@bro2000:matrix.org> Is there any particular reason for defining these methods on the `Node` interface?

Probably because they used to work on or accept Attr nodes, many years ago. We could move them to ParentNode now but that would not really improve things in an interesting way. (It would change the type of exception thrown and change various feature-tests like `'insertBefore' in Attr` which I'm not aware of anyone using.)
