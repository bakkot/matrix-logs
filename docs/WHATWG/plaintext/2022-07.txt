Hi! I recently joined a company that already signed the participation agreement - How do I make https://participate.whatwg.org/agreement-status?user=nicolo-ribaudo&repo=html pick it up, rather than being stuck on a non-verified signature I submitted last year?

annevk: is there anything in the websocket spec that still requires what this test is testing? http://wpt.live/websockets/constructor/014.html (i.e. to wait with establishing another websocket connection to the same host while the previous is still connecting, as a DOS prevention mechanism)
