Hi! I recently joined a company that already signed the participation agreement - How do I make https://participate.whatwg.org/agreement-status?user=nicolo-ribaudo&repo=html pick it up, rather than being stuck on a non-verified signature I submitted last year?

nicolo-ribaudo: the reviewer of your first PR should verify it

[05:22:37.0802] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ok thanks! I'll wait until my PR is non-draft before worrying about it

annevk: is there anything in the websocket spec that still requires what this test is testing? http://wpt.live/websockets/constructor/014.html (i.e. to wait with establishing another websocket connection to the same host while the previous is still connecting, as a DOS prevention mechanism)

zcorpan: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-4.1

If the client already has a WebSocket connection to the remote
host (IP address) identified by /host/ and port /port/ pair, even
if the remote host is known by another name, the client MUST wait
until that connection has been established or for that connection
to have failed.  There MUST be no more than one connection in a
CONNECTING state.

[07:57:44.0433] <Yutaka Hirano>
Maybe this?

[07:58:20.0905] <zcorpan>
Yutaka Hirano: Thanks! Yes. I thought it was defined in the API rather than the protocol

[07:59:25.0189] <zcorpan>
It shouldn't delay the first connection though, but maybe browsers have to wait a microtask or a task to avoid race conditions?
