If I were in charge of the web, I'd probably tell GitHub to change GitHub pages or they'd be left behind
(It's probably a good thing I'm not in charge of the web)

Hi people, hope you are having a good day. I have a question, how would one unit test the correctness of an HTML parser, should I just find several malformed html pages and test against what Chrome or Mozilla parses in the browser, I'll also appreciate it there are links to test cases, e.g if you have so so so malformed structure, you get the following output, something like that. I have seen few but I need more to test rigorously. Thanks

devsrealmguy: you may get a better response on https://matrix.to/#/#wpt:matrix.org (though there is a lot of shared people between these rooms)

Thanks, I'll join the room now

annevk Am I correct in my interpretation that `Foo: abc, xyz\r\n` and `Foo: abc\r\nFoo: xyz\r\n` are both fetch spec compliant on the wire encodings for a request issued with `fetch` as follows?
```js
fetch(url, { headers: [["Foo", "abc"], ["Foo", "xyz"]] })
```
