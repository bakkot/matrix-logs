If I were in charge of the web, I'd probably tell GitHub to change GitHub pages or they'd be left behind
(It's probably a good thing I'm not in charge of the web)

Hi people, hope you are having a good day. I have a question, how would one unit test the correctness of an HTML parser, should I just find several malformed html pages and test against what Chrome or Mozilla parses in the browser, I'll also appreciate it there are links to test cases, e.g if you have so so so malformed structure, you get the following output, something like that. I have seen few but I need more to test rigorously. Thanks

[09:15:25.0029] <Alan Stearns>
devsrealmguy: you may get a better response on https://matrix.to/#/#wpt:matrix.org (though there is a lot of shared people between these rooms)

[09:16:22.0205] <devsrealmguy>
Thanks, I'll join the room now

annevk Am I correct in my interpretation that `Foo: abc, xyz\r\n` and `Foo: abc\r\nFoo: xyz\r\n` are both fetch spec compliant on the wire encodings for a request issued with `fetch` as follows?
```js
fetch(url, { headers: [["Foo", "abc"], ["Foo", "xyz"]] })
```

I’m trying to clone an `SVGRect` object using `structuredClone()`, but am getting _DataCloneError: The object could not be cloned` error_ — because, I guess, the `SVGRect` object isn’t serializable.

[10:26:25.0558] <sideshowbarker>
But what part of it wouldn’t be serializable?

[10:28:39.0384] <sideshowbarker>
Specifically, what I have is an SVG `marker` element with a `viewBox` attribute, and I assign that to a `marker` variable, and when I log `console.log(marker.viewBox.baseVal), the browser logs this:
```js
[object SVGRect] {
  height: 10,
  width: 10,
  x: 0,
  y: 0
```

[10:30:04.0258] <sideshowbarker>
…but if I then do this:
```js
let foo = self.structuredClone(marker.viewBox.baseVal);
```
…it fails and that browser logs that _DataCloneError: The object could not be cloned_ 

[10:30:11.0671] <sideshowbarker>

Web APIs are by default not serializable, even with `DOMRect`, which is as close to a plain object as it gets

[12:47:29.0258] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
Maybe it'd be worth it to try and identify such interfaces

[12:55:26.0084] <sideshowbarker>
I see


2022-01-03
[16:17:11.0133] <Domenic>
It is kind of understandable that SVGRect is not serializable though. It is not a plain object; it has an inner connection to a SVG element. And serializing that across realm boundaries is tricky.

[16:17:23.0319] <Domenic>
DOMRect is very simple though and could be made serializable.

[16:17:51.0184] <Domenic>
I believe the spec still says SVGRect is simple but this was a misstep in the spec and they need to change it back to match implementations https://github.com/w3c/svgwg/issues/706

[16:17:54.0714] <Domenic>
We ran into this in jsdom

[16:18:35.0701] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
TIL

[00:12:02.0920] <annevk>
Luca Casonato: I guess it's strictly speaking not defined, yeah

[01:26:47.0804] <annevk>
Luca Casonato: given that people notice it we might still want to define it though

[01:29:31.0544] <Luca Casonato>
I guess we could. The current spec language makes what Deno does the most obvious thing to do I think, as headers in the inner header list are not concatenated. Chrome and FF both concatenate the headers on the wire it seems. I didn’t check Safari or Cloudflare Workers

[01:36:51.0738] <Luca Casonato>
And annevk, as for who noticed that: the author of node-fetch. Have received no reports from “regular” users who are not intimately familiar with the fetch spec.

[01:39:57.0596] <annevk>
Yeah fair

[01:40:25.0401] <annevk>
Combining is also tricky for Set-Cookie, though that's tricky anyway atm

[03:26:30.0518] <csarven>
Is it possible to request target in `asterisk-form` (`OPTIONS *`) with the fetch (or another) API? Any pointers on history/discussion would be great.

[12:04:02.0755] <bakkot>
I've just learned that `postMessage` is async, such that if you do `worker.postMessage(); while (true) {}` the message will never actually fire. Is there a reason for this? If no, could it be changed, possibly as an opt-in option? This comes up in the context of emscripten.

[12:09:29.0250] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
I don't think that's true per the spec

[12:09:30.0043] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#dom-worker-postmessage

[12:10:25.0841] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
The only task or microtask queued in that algorithm is the one that is actually queued on the worker's event loop

[12:12:14.0827] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
But I guess it comes down to the notion of observability, since you can't observe the result of a task in a worker thread if the main thread is stuck in a loop

[12:13:34.0204] <bakkot>
you can with a SAB

[12:13:46.0792] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
True. Then this is a bug

[12:25:56.0599] <bakkot>
MDN has it documented:

> After postMessage() is called, the MessageEvent will be dispatched only after all pending execution contexts have finished. For example, if postMessage() is invoked in an event handler, that event handler will run to completion, as will any remaining handlers for that same event, before the MessageEvent is dispatched.

[12:28:02.0789] <bakkot>
I can't actually tell from reading the spec if the "add a task" implies adding it on the current thread or the worker's, but I'll take your word for it.

[12:30:32.0783] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
That task fires the `message` event, and event firing is synchronous, so it must be on the worker's thread

[12:47:33.0759] <Domenic>
I think this is related to https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3691 . Basically, postMessage() infrastructure assumes the target could be cross-process. Although this is not true for dedicated workers it could be for iframes or shared/service workers. The spec as-written doesn't really acknowledge this so it acts as if you can get synchronous access to the target's message queue. But, in general, you cannot; if your process is busy-looping you're gonna have a hard time pushing messages across process boundaries, I believe.

[12:48:21.0468] <Domenic>
So in theory implementations could maybe special-case dedicatedWorker.postMessage() to make that work even in the presence of busy loops. In practice that'd probably be quite involved as they'd essentially have to create a parallel message-queuing infrastructure for dedicated workers only.

[12:54:06.0434] <bakkot>
huh, ok, it looks like I was actually wrong (I wrote a test case but it was bugged) and the MDN page is are also wrong

[12:54:21.0188] <bakkot>
here's my test case (now that I've fixed it)

```
let workerSrc = `
let arr;
self.addEventListener('message', e => {
  switch (e.data.message) {
    case 'init': {
      console.log('worker: got init');
      arr = new Int32Array(e.data.buf);
      Atomics.notify(arr, 0);
      break;
    }
    case 'next': {
      console.log('worker: got next');
      arr[1] = 1;
      break;
    }
  }
});
`;
let blob = new Blob([workerSrc], {type: 'application/javascript'});
let worker = new Worker(URL.createObjectURL(blob));

(async () => {
  let buf = new SharedArrayBuffer(16);
  let arr = new Int32Array(buf);
  worker.postMessage({ message: 'init', buf });

  if (typeof Atomics.waitAsync === 'function') {
    await Atomics.waitAsync(arr, 0, 0).value;
  } else {
    // give the worker time to start
    await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 1000));
  }

  console.log('init');
  worker.postMessage({ message: 'next' });

  console.log('now we busy-wait, with arr[1] initially =', arr[1]);
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e8; ++i) {
    if (arr[1] === 1) {
      console.log('done! took until i =', i);
      return;
    }
  }
  console.log('never initialized');
})().catch(e => console.error('error', e));
```

[12:54:47.0964] <bakkot>
in chrome and FF this does actually finish; FF seems to take literally no iterations of the loop, where chrome takes a couple hundred

[12:54:56.0127] <bakkot>

the actual behavior in Chrome appears to be, you can synchronously send messages _except in an onmessage handler_, which is pretty bizarre

[09:22:12.0410] <Yoav Weiss>
in terms of who owns this spec?

[09:22:57.0185] <annevk>
Yoav Weiss: well it seems the Perf WG owns it, but it hasn't been moving along the REC track

[09:23:12.0389] <annevk>
Yoav Weiss: and issue addressing went kinda silent a couple years ago

[09:23:59.0863] <annevk>
There was a FPWD in 2017 and that's it

[09:24:28.0794] <Yoav Weiss>
From the eng side, it can use a little more attention. I'm hoping to make progress on attribution later this year

[09:25:43.0345] <Yoav Weiss>
On the spec/WG side, it was adopted to the WG with one implementation. The amount of progress in can make on the REC track without a second implementation is limited

[09:26:37.0941] <Yoav Weiss>
Any specific issues you feel need addressing?

[09:27:44.0748] <annevk>
Not sure, but I imagine some are not really up for being addressed if Chrome has shipped this for that long

[09:28:30.0974] <annevk>
And for some I wonder what ended up being implemented, e.g., elsewhere Perf APIs do account for long URLs, but here the issue is still open

[09:30:15.0732] <Yoav Weiss>
OK, let me take an action item to go over the issues and make sure we make progress on the ones we can make progress on (and close the ones where we can't)

emilio: so :active/:hover use the flat tree, but :has() uses the node tree? Is using the flat tree for selector matching not really expensive?

> <@annevk:mozilla.org> emilio: so :active/:hover use the flat tree, but :has() uses the node tree? Is using the flat tree for selector matching not really expensive?

That is right. :has() uses the node tree like all other selector combinators, why would it use the flat tree?

[04:26:56.0527] <emilio>
Not that it would be impossible to do but it'd be weird 

[04:28:31.0240] <annevk>
emilio: yeah never mind, I guess it all makes sense. And :has can't really use the flat tree as that'd break encapsulation, I think.

[04:30:59.0627] <emilio>
Right

[07:48:47.0837] <Domenic>
Thinking of trying to tackle https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/849 again, or at least make progress ... is there any easy way to know what element names the HTML parser accepts? Or do I have to walk through various parser states?

[07:49:33.0344] <Domenic>
I guess looking at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#tag-open-state + tag name state is not too bad...

[08:14:37.0657] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
can someone who understands how event dispatch is specified comment on https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=234730? because I've utterly confused myself now.

[08:27:09.0889] <annevk>
Domenic: can element names contain `>` today? That seems problematic

[08:27:46.0860] <annevk>
Domenic: I doubt we want to allow CR

[08:27:57.0487] <Domenic>
\> is excluded from LenientElementNameStartChar and LenientElementNameChar in my sketch

[08:28:03.0756] <Domenic>
 * \> is excluded from LenientElementNameStartChar and LenientElementNameChar in my sketch

[08:28:27.0629] <Domenic>
I think CR is probably disallowed by the parser but as preprocessing, so I didn't see it when reading. Good catch.

[08:28:34.0509] <Domenic>
Although what about entities hmm

[08:29:56.0557] <Domenic>
Entities don't work in tag names, huh

[08:30:15.0366] <annevk>
Oh I missed `>` there

[08:30:26.0933] <annevk>
Yeah entities only work inside attributes or between tags

[08:30:48.0959] <annevk>
(Context is https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/849 fwiw.)

[08:31:18.0637] <annevk>
The other thing I wonder about is whether we should only add leniency for the HTML namespace

[08:32:26.0125] <annevk>
But maybe it doesn't matter so much as you can already create trees that cannot serialize as XML so simplicity ought to win

[08:33:10.0967] <Domenic>
I cannot find what in the spec disallows the parser from creating elements with CR

[08:33:14.0791] <Domenic>
But browsers do not allow it http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=9940

[08:34:00.0724] <Domenic>
I think https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#tag-name-state is missing CR

[08:34:12.0004] <Andreu Botella (he/they)>
CR is handled in the preprocessing stage

[08:34:39.0059] <annevk>
> Before the tokenization stage, the input stream must be preprocessed by normalizing newlines.

[08:34:40.0846] <Domenic>
I couldn't find that Ctrl+Fing for "CARRIAGE RETURN", and lots of parser steps actually look for CR...

[08:35:06.0884] <Domenic>
OK, so why does CR appear explicitly in places like https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-initial-insertion-mode

[08:35:56.0596] <annevk>
Domenic: I think that might be due to an entity reference?

[08:36:13.0056] <Domenic>
Seems plausible

[08:37:31.0228] <annevk>
Yeah, it's a conformance error, but it will get through

[08:37:32.0459] <Domenic>
Yeah because the tokenizer converts them then returns to the state it was in previously

[08:37:50.0375] <annevk>
No idea why that was not normalized as well...

[08:37:55.0048] <Domenic>
OK, updating whatwg/dom thread to exclude CR, and it looks like there are no spec bugs around CR

[08:38:35.0068] <annevk>
I guess it wasn't normalized because you can also get there through JS and guarding all entry points would be somewhat pointless overhead

[08:39:16.0101] <annevk>
(Not that specific point, but as an attribute value, say.)

[08:39:17.0841] <Domenic>
Well I think the idea is if you do `&#xD;` in certain places then you actually should end up with a CR in the resulting parsed data

[08:39:50.0855] <Domenic>
And so e.g. if you do that in early parts of the document then the initial insertion mode state will actually see the CR and ignore it, not normalize it

[08:40:50.0668] <annevk>
Right, though then the question is why `&#0;` doesn't work (but JS equivalents do)

[08:40:54.0997] <Domenic>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#parsing-main-incolgroup is a better example where it inserts the CR instead of ignoring it.

[08:41:39.0657] <Domenic>
Hmmm

[08:41:48.0392] <annevk>
Finding logic in the parser might not be the best use of our time 🙂

[08:42:28.0095] <Domenic>
Yeah OK good point

[08:42:48.0257] <annevk>
For strictly split on : it might be worth clarifying you'd split on the first or concatenate return values 1...N

[08:45:07.0601] <annevk>
For Prefix there might still be some edge cases I suspect due to XML 4th/5th edition divide, where browsers didn't uniformly stick with the 4th (not entirely sure if some updated the parser, but not the corresponding DOM methods)

[08:47:03.0913] <Domenic>
Yeah I wonder about tests, I wonder if we can apply https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/theres-only-four-billion-floatsso-test-them-all/ to this

[08:47:31.0105] <Domenic>
Probably not :)

[08:48:18.0296] <annevk>
For PCENChar I think the banning of noncharacters is a bit dumb and removing that would simplify the production a lot

[08:48:35.0510] <Domenic>
Yeah I don't have strong feelings there, happy to take a new suggestion.

[08:54:00.0208] <annevk>
Oh I see, that came from XML and we'll preserve some of that through NameStartChar. I guess I'd consider simplifying that as well to C0 and above or even A0 and above (like URL code points), but I'm not sure how much we want to go for

[08:55:30.0020] <Domenic>
On the one hand, it's pretty separable. On the other hand, maybe we should do this all at once, since it's hard to get momentum for these sorts of things.

[08:56:20.0358] <Domenic>
Oh, or you mean just making LenientNameStartChar even more lenient

[08:56:45.0291] <annevk>
Well all of them I suppose. Less range checks ftw

[08:57:57.0457] <annevk>
Nobody has ever proven the value of segmenting Unicode in such a way to my knowledge and most things work fine without it

[08:58:00.0441] <Domenic>
Unpaired surrogates?

[08:59:16.0236] <annevk>
Hmm that's a good point, you included them but does that actually work?

[09:00:38.0994] <annevk>
Oh wait, URLs do consider noncharacters non-conforming, but they do work. Surrogates cannot work there however.

[09:06:29.0048] <Domenic>
I think they work http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/?saved=9941

[09:06:40.0472] <annevk>
Domenic: as for testing, given Unicode is 2^21 if I'm not mistaken that might actually be feasible? Element-creation is a bit more expensive than floats though I suppose 🙂

[09:06:56.0574] <Domenic>
Yeah that's my worry.

[09:07:26.0151] <Domenic>
IIRC we already have a cloneNode test that can cause timeouts just when creating + cloning one instance of every existing/historical HTML tag name

[09:07:43.0997] <Domenic>
C++ unit tests in browsers could probably be exhaustive though

[09:09:56.0650] <annevk>
We could have a manual test for us to verify things on the side and for when computers get fast

[09:10:07.0698] <annevk>
It does seem that surrogates are fair game, hurray

[09:15:08.0441] <Domenic>
I guess the question is whether we want to make it *easier* to create non-serializable DOMs via DOM APIs. I think that's slightly bad? So maybe sticking with the union of current DOM API values + HTML parser values would be better than just allowing the DOM APIs to be maximally free.

[09:28:45.0900] <annevk>
Domenic: that would somewhat argue for branching on the HTML/SVG/MathML namespaces which is a bit odd

[09:29:16.0884] <annevk>
But I guess it still works if the approach is minimal set of steps starting from the status quo, or some such

[09:29:19.0090] <Domenic>
Well, within reason, I guess :)

[09:29:41.0817] <Domenic>
I'll add a comment with your approach

[09:30:50.0245] <annevk>
Thanks, I guess I mainly want to hear from someone that these range checks are negligible, since otherwise we might as well improve that while we're there

[09:35:08.0505] <Domenic>
In your version what is the justification for excluding tab, LF, CR, FF, space, /, >, and NULL? If we are no longer concerned about serializability seems like they could be allowed...

[09:42:08.0220] <annevk>
Domenic: I think it would all still work in the HTML parser when serialized? It's mainly XML that's affected for worse

[09:42:22.0832] <Domenic>
Oh right

[09:42:35.0020] <Domenic>
Not sure what I was thinking

[09:42:44.0173] <Domenic>
OK I am more in favor of your proposal now

[09:50:21.0437] <Domenic>
OK no I see what I was saying. Consider the following element local name: "$a". This is currently disallowed by createElement(). And the parser cannot parse it. But if we allow a larger set for createElement(), then the resulting serialization is something the parser cannot parse.

[09:51:11.0145] <Domenic>
Like ideally createElement() would only accept ASCII alpha for the first character; that would guarantee it only ever creates elements which serialize in a parseable way. But we already accept, for whatever reason, NameStartChar. The conclusion then is we should probably not expand beyond NameStartChar.

[10:54:32.0507] <ntim>
Domenic: Hi! I'm curious about how the <popup> anchoring works, and how/if it affects the containing block of the element? <popup> are designed to be in the top layer which forces the containing block to the viewport, so it's a question i'm wondering.

[10:54:54.0092] <Domenic>
ntim: I don't know much about <popup>; mfreed is the person to ask there.

[10:55:52.0635] <ntim>
/me hopes it's not yet another special positioning algorithm that isn't CSS describable

[11:04:15.0303] <Alan Stearns>
As far as I know, anchoring of popups is still under discussion. This has some history, and there’s a current proposal linked at the end: https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/599

Do browsers really not support floats in `sx` and `sy` values for canvas `drawImage`? https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/11825

[14:10:00.0551] <sideshowbarker>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#2dcontext:dom-context-2d-drawimage-3 says they’re doubles

[15:21:02.0889] <Domenic>
Maybe by "all browsers" that person means "all browsers on iOS"

[15:57:41.0061] <sideshowbarker>

Ah yeah that seems more likely


2022-01-09
[04:04:48.0850] <annevk>
Domenic: I guess either that or indeed lift all restrictions as it doesn't matter much (though for custom elements we probably want to continue to have parser-compatible requirements)

Mattias Buelens: are the tests in https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/32072 ready for review? Did you check coverage of the new lines perchance?

[08:45:37.0831] <Mattias Buelens>
The new tests can already be reviewed, but we're probably going to need a couple more tests. I haven't checked the coverage yet, I'll do that.

Does there exist something like [this](https://htmlparser.info) for css?

[04:59:48.0858] <annevk>
I don't think so, but CSS was much more designed so if you go over the CSS grammar iterations you can find out a lot

[05:00:20.0981] <annevk>
Probably the biggest change came in 2.1 with it getting defined error handling (iirc)

[05:09:09.0805] <sujaldev>

emilio: I'd appreciate if you could review https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/7361 as well, it looks fine editorially, but I'm not a 100% comfortable with the focus algorithms

Understandable, it's not ideal for Europe to begin with 🙂

[10:42:33.0191] <miketayl_r>
i'm not good at bay area geography, is europe north bay or south bay?

[11:02:24.0427] <TabAtkins>
all of europe is north sea

[11:06:30.0227] <TabAtkins>
tho another answer is that the north/south bay divide is probably right around 37°37′, which means all but the southernmost tips of spain, italy, and greece are north bay

[11:07:02.0899] <TabAtkins>
turkey actually has some non-trivial south bay population

[11:12:48.0213] <annevk>
miketayl_r: Sausalito? Kinda

[11:13:52.0615] <annevk>
Also where does that leave Boston?

[12:36:40.0577] <miketayl_r>
just past Berkeley, i think

@domenic I believe we should also file spec bugs with Firefox and Safari for the changes to *default readers* in https://github.com/whatwg/streams/pull/1168 ? That PR affects *both* default and BYOB readers.

Oh shoot, I somehow missed that obvious fact. Honestly we shouldn't have merged without getting their buy-in. My bad. Please let's file the bugs and if they have objections we can roll back.

[13:20:43.0016] <Mattias Buelens>
All right 🙂

[13:27:21.0884] <Luca Casonato>
Would it be a huge deal of extra work for you all to also open implementation issues on Deno and Node repos for spec changes in whatwg/streams? Just a simple "heads up: this thing is changing" with a link to the PR, or a "cc @lucacasonato @jasnell" on relevant PRs would be very awesome :-)

[14:27:56.0864] <mgaudet>
Question about streams specification; I was looking at an older [chrome security bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1045874). Some cursory testing suggests that in addition to the chrome change, it has been fixed at the specification level. 

Nevertheless, I'm wondering: For lists being iterated where calling into user-defined code, does it make sense to change the specification to adopt a similar policy to the chrome change (move the list into a local, iterate the local instead). Defensively I think it makes sense for our implementation, but I'm not sure how this is looked at from a specification perspective.

[14:33:56.0719] <Mattias Buelens>
Well, exactly that was just landed in https://github.com/whatwg/streams/pull/1168. 😛 We now move the list into a local variable first before we iterate it. This turned out to be necessary for the correctness of the async iterator steps ([see comment](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/pull/1168#discussion_r778476614)).

[14:35:31.0169] <mgaudet>
(Github has those links broken, but I found the conversation). Nice! Looks like I'm ahead of the game for once

has anyone ever suggested the ability to control undo/redo? i didn't see anything on the gh

[16:49:10.0823] <devsnek>
the use case i have in mind is like, say you're switching between tabs of some ui that contain inputs. when you switch tabs, those inputs get removed and added and whatnot, so they lose their history

zcorpan: had you seen https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1687557?

[01:03:15.0541] <johannhof>
annevk: Hey, I was just going through my old needinfos and noticed https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1708354

[01:04:02.0243] <johannhof>
And that bug itself aside, it feels to me like Chrome and Firefox both shipped this restriction but didn't end up updating the spec (I can't even find an issue for it)

[01:06:32.0535] <johannhof>
But I'm slightly confused about which spec is responsible for defining these restrictions, is it the Notifications spec or Permissions?

[01:07:08.0350] <johannhof>
i.e. would it be enough that Notifications says "this is a powerful feature" and then we derive somehow that these are either PP controlled in iframes or forbidden?

[01:45:57.0823] <annevk>
johannhof: I think the idea was that Permissions Policy would take care of this, but it might not have been integrated everywhere just yet

[01:49:12.0581] <johannhof>
annevk: Right, so, I guess there are two things here. As per that bug, these checks should not only apply when requesting permission but also when notifications are sent. The second question is what does PP do for features that are powerful but not explicitly part of PP (which I think notifications is not?)

[01:50:33.0578] <annevk>
Oh right, I guess those we have to update, but that hasn't happened. Same for persistent storage.

[01:51:02.0101] <johannhof>
I guess point 1 might be captured by having the permission check in the constructor https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/#constructors, so that might only be a Firefox implementation issue

[01:52:57.0366] <johannhof>
And then step 3 of https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#reading-current-states will only do the correct thing (deny the request) if there's a policy controlled feature for "notifications" that's always forbidden

[01:55:03.0551] <johannhof>
What is the state of the registry for permissions policy? Is it still up to the individual standards to define their own entry? So would this be a change in Notifications and Storage?

[02:29:47.0243] <annevk>
johannhof: for notifications it probably needs to be a local change; for persistent storage I'm not entirely sure what the model should be

[02:30:31.0764] <annevk>
It makes sense to me that you cannot ask for persistent storage permission, but if you're non-partitioned (i.e., have "storage access") you should probably have persistent storage there

[02:30:56.0498] <annevk>
The equivalent doesn't make sense for notifications however

[02:31:28.0802] <annevk>
Although I guess for storage as well it being non-partitioned is a thing that will soonish no longer be possible

[02:48:32.0157] <johannhof>
Yeah, you're right, storage is more complicated...

[02:49:01.0523] <johannhof>
Another edge case that always partitioning helps with :)

[03:19:50.0589] <johannhof>
