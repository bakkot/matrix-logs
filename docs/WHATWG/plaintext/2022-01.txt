If I were in charge of the web, I'd probably tell GitHub to change GitHub pages or they'd be left behind
(It's probably a good thing I'm not in charge of the web)

Hi people, hope you are having a good day. I have a question, how would one unit test the correctness of an HTML parser, should I just find several malformed html pages and test against what Chrome or Mozilla parses in the browser, I'll also appreciate it there are links to test cases, e.g if you have so so so malformed structure, you get the following output, something like that. I have seen few but I need more to test rigorously. Thanks

devsrealmguy: you may get a better response on https://matrix.to/#/#wpt:matrix.org (though there is a lot of shared people between these rooms)

Thanks, I'll join the room now

annevk Am I correct in my interpretation that `Foo: abc, xyz\r\n` and `Foo: abc\r\nFoo: xyz\r\n` are both fetch spec compliant on the wire encodings for a request issued with `fetch` as follows?
```js
fetch(url, { headers: [["Foo", "abc"], ["Foo", "xyz"]] })
```

I’m trying to clone an `SVGRect` object using `structuredClone()`, but am getting _DataCloneError: The object could not be cloned` error_ — because, I guess, the `SVGRect` object isn’t serializable.

[10:26:25.0558] <sideshowbarker>
But what part of it wouldn’t be serializable?

[10:28:39.0384] <sideshowbarker>
Specifically, what I have is an SVG `marker` element with a `viewBox` attribute, and I assign that to a `marker` variable, and when I log `console.log(marker.viewBox.baseVal), the browser logs this:
```js
[object SVGRect] {
  height: 10,
  width: 10,
  x: 0,
  y: 0
```

[10:30:04.0258] <sideshowbarker>
…but if I then do this:
```js
let foo = self.structuredClone(marker.viewBox.baseVal);
```
…it fails and that browser logs that _DataCloneError: The object could not be cloned_
