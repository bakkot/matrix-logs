Hello, could someone tell what does mean:
> The insertion point is relative to the position of the character immediately after it, it is not an absolute offset into the input stream.

Why not absolute?

PSA: About https://git-pulse.github.io/snapshots/ — a while back I added the WebKit repo to the set of repos it tracks, and yesterday I added the https://github.com/chromium/chromium mirror and https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev mirror.

The Chromium and Gecko mirrors don’t use GitHub for patch reviews, so the PR stats for them aren’t relevant — but the committer stats are. And the [Chromium numbers](https://git-pulse.github.io/snapshots/chromium-chromium-2024-05-31-pulse.html) are [so exceptional](https://git-pulse.github.io/snapshots/?project=chromium_chromium) that it makes me wonder if what my tool is seeing and reporting is actually accurate —

- 13131 commits to main per month
- 1310 unique committers per month
- 11738 total unique committers over the entire repo history
- 49 unique new first-time committers each month
