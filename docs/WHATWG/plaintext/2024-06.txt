Hello, could someone tell what does mean:
> The insertion point is relative to the position of the character immediately after it, it is not an absolute offset into the input stream.

Why not absolute?

[01:40:43.0573] <annevk>
sunil: I think you're correct that it's supposed to work although I'm not sure to what extent we actively considered shared/service workers at the time. I don't recall.

[01:42:20.0539] <sunil>
Thanks annevk, Do you know who could have more idea on this?

[01:45:25.0990] <sunil>
annevk: I am implementing this in Firefox and trying to check if it would be helpful to extend the wpt to  service workers as well. It wouldn't add much value if other browsers do not fully support it for workers though.

OK ‚Äî good to have that confirmation. And I‚Äôm glad now to have finally added the repo to set that tool monitors. The numbers are more interesting relative to other projects (beyond just the absolute numbers)

Yoav Weiss: so noopener-allow-popups would be used on the opener side and make all the newly opened windows opened basically with noopener? Or am I misunderstanding this?

[01:24:51.0700] <smaug>
(in the pr I don't quite understand "maintain its opener relationship with them" - who maintains opener, when we just cut opener relationship )

[01:58:13.0125] <Yoav Weiss>
smaug: If the header is used by a document, its openers would lose the ability to script it, but it would still have the ability to open other same-origin documents and script them

[01:58:48.0491] <Yoav Weiss>
smaug: does that clarify things? I'll reexamine the language I used there to try and make it clearer

[01:59:04.0761] <Yoav Weiss>
I also added an explainer https://gist.github.com/yoavweiss/c7b61e97e6f8d207be619f87ab96ead5

[02:02:00.0669] <smaug>

document.write can insert stuff into the input stream

[02:15:41.0101] <Maxim Vaarwel>

It's clear. I ask you to explain why it talks about relative and not absolute offset. Can you provide an example that can might break logic if it will be an absolute offset?

[02:36:14.0592] <Maxim Vaarwel>
> <@zcorpan:mozilla.org> document.write can insert stuff into the input stream

 * It's clear. I ask why it talks about relative and not absolute offset. Can you provide an example that can might break logic if it will be an absolute offset?

[03:32:48.0027] <smaug>
which makes "noopener" quite confusing, when there can be plenty of other references too if the newly loaded page isn't the first one in the window

[03:35:30.0370] <zcorpan>
I don't know if an absolute offset breaks anything

[03:44:32.0689] <Maxim Vaarwel>
> <@zcorpan:mozilla.org> I don't know if an absolute offset breaks anything

Then I do not understand for what purpose this "warning" was written, contrasting the relative with the absolute offset. By chance, do you know the reason for this formulation?

[04:19:37.0956] <annevk>
smaug: I don't think that's true? Assuming the newly loaded page is the one with the new value. COOP can guarantee nobody has a reference to you, by literally creating a new browsing context and such.

[06:12:39.0082] <smaug>
annevk: I mean the terminology. It is not about opener, but about having a new top level thingie which no one can refer to

[06:18:56.0757] <annevk>
smaug: it's a new thingie without an opener? noopener, if you will :p

[06:19:30.0744] <annevk>
I find noopener clearer than omit, but maybe there's something even better

[06:27:49.0888] <smaug>
I must be confused. This is about opening a new same origin window (or loading a new page to existing window), and we want that nothing from outside has references to it, right?

[07:37:02.0400] <Yoav Weiss>
Yeah, that's correct. I'm fine with renaming to something better, if you have an ideas

[07:38:14.0414] <Yoav Weiss>
(although "nothing from outside" doesn't currently include e.g. an iframe parent)

[07:38:47.0701] <Yoav Weiss>
The current scope is really about the opener

in https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#prod-AttributeName isnt the possible values for `AttributeNameKeyword` already covered by the `identifier` production?

Meghan Denny: I think because of: "If the longest possible match could match one of the above named terminal symbols or one of the other terminal symbols from the grammar, it must be tokenized as the latter." in https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-grammar

right, okay yeah that makes sense I think I didnt connect 2-and-2 for a sec

[11:39:36.0106] <Meghan Denny>
that means when AttributeName is added to the ast it needs to be distinguishable which one it matched as

[11:40:29.0361] <Meghan Denny>
that was the part I was looking for but I can read the doc more to find out

[11:44:15.0943] <Meghan Denny>

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#parsing-main-incdata - another question, does the step about `An end tag whose tag name is "script"` also apply to SVG script? Or is the parsing for SVG contexts specced somewhere else?

Hmmm. Does it also apply before finishing bookmark? The popup opens and the new bookmark is not created yet, and still the star is highlighted

[01:48:00.0363] <smaug>
the page is star'ed immediately, I believe. The star stays highlighted even if you just hide the popup by clicking elsewhere

[01:49:03.0784] <krosylight>
> <@smaug:mozilla.org> the page is star'ed immediately, I believe. The star stays highlighted even if you just hide the popup by clicking elsewhere

Hiding the popup is treated as Save (well, yeah) and saves bookmark

the tests are not written in a way which makes them easy to split

[08:12:51.0009] <bakkot>
test262 does things in a slightly different way, where there is a central list of all the TA types, and in that case I could just conditionally add it to that list based on whether it's present

[08:13:00.0644] <bakkot>
but the WPT tests aren't really set up for that

Luke Warlow: I prolly can't look at Trusted Types PRs again until somewhere next week. Maybe zcorpan or Dominic Farolino can help out with some review on the DOM stuff meanwhile? I think your suggestion of an optional boolean is reasonable, if one path indeed has to be vetted and the other does not. (Not enough time at the moment to deeply investigate.)

[09:50:46.0795] <annevk>
Luke Warlow: and at worst I might not have time until July. Depends a bit on some unknowns.

[09:51:30.0229] <Luke Warlow>
Yeah no worries I'm OOO till at least Tuesday. It would be good to get other eyes on it too. I'm slightly blind to it given the iteration (apologies for the churn). Any other eyes over it would be great!

[09:54:11.0988] <annevk>
zcorpan: Dominic Farolino: for clarity, https://github.com/whatwg/dom/pull/1268 is the PR in question

[10:03:07.0589] <keithamus>
Thanks I‚Äôll look into this as I can. It might be a week or two though. 

[11:30:20.0890] <Dominic Farolino>
If you can formally request my review that'd be a great way to get it in my inbox

[11:30:37.0307] <Dominic Farolino>
Also tough for me to get to it before next Tuesday but I can try, or at the very least review it after.

[12:30:49.0572] <Luke Warlow>
As I say I'm OOO till Tuesday so no rush.

[12:31:55.0343] <Luke Warlow>
* As I say I'm OOO till Tuesday so no rush. I've added you as a reviewer.

Hi! Should I be able to find info about timings for WHATNOT and other relevant information about WHATNOT somewhere? I was looking at https://whatwg.org/working-mode#meetings but don't see how it's regularly scheduled. Thanks.

Only in Google Doc that's not linked to anywhere

[02:07:10.0815] <sideshowbarker>
A while back, I opened a PR to add a link to it somewhere, but the PR did not get approved 

[02:07:18.0005] <muan>
Ha. Cool. Is the Google Doc public and include other relevant info? If so I'd love to take a look.

Dominic Farolino: hey I was curious about something with Observables; when you subscribe with a signal, how would you then use that signal in any of your callback handling? Such as passing it to a fetch you might start based on a click?

[01:01:00.0356] <littledan>
I guess you can always close over that AbortSignal separately, but I wonder if we should make this more automatic by having an implicit AsyncContext variable propagate things (if there wasn‚Äôt already a plan for that)

[01:02:02.0037] <annevk>
Does AsyncContext also work for 'synchronous' events?

[01:03:00.0806] <annevk>
 * Does AsyncContext also work for 'synchronous' events? (I guess it does, given what we discussed.)

[01:04:31.0148] <littledan>
Yes, it is just a mechanism for saving and restoring dynamically scoped variables. The only thing async about it is that it does this around await by default 

[01:04:47.0058] <littledan>
The whole API is synchronous 

[06:35:01.0623] <Dominic Farolino>
annevk: I'm actually not sure I get the question. The signal you subscribe with is for the observable/producer to be aware of consumer-initiated unsubscription. I don't think you want to use the signal in the consumer's callbacks.

[09:00:10.0579] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: why not?

[09:01:03.0429] <annevk>
"I'm no longer interested in this event and if it started any activity on my behalf I'm no longer interested in that either" seems quite reasonable to me.

[14:14:47.0011] <Dominic Farolino>
Right that's reasonable enough. But I don't understand the question "how would you then use that signal"? You just pass it into whatever API (like `fetch()`) receives signals I guess!

[14:19:20.0814] <littledan>
Yeah the question is whether it is practical to thread it through. (Some JS developers I have spoken with say it is, some say it isn‚Äôt)

[14:19:52.0854] <littledan>
* Yeah the question is whether it is practical to thread it through manually, or whether, in practice, people will forget to do so, and strand resources. (Some JS developers I have spoken with say it is, some say it isn‚Äôt)

[20:30:05.0787] <Dominic Farolino>
Hmm, well I'd think if you're already threading it through `subscribe()` (to unsubscribe later), then threading it through more places is the same amount of effort. Otherwise it sounds like a discussion about how practical AbortController/Signal is in general, I guess.

[01:03:11.0119] <zcorpan>
Dominic Farolino: Can you take another look at https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/45650 ? ty :)

[01:41:27.0748] <annevk>
Dominic Farolino: well you could imagine it being exposed to the callback so whoever is writing the callback doesn't need to know about who is subscribing directly

[01:43:51.0666] <annevk>
Though we don't offer that with addEventListener() either I suppose, but I could imagine wanting that. Perhaps AsyncContext will help with these cases.

[06:48:33.0430] <lustigerleo>
Hi folks,

I'm not so much a developer myself as a media archaeologist. I'm currently writing a thesis on the history and development of web browsers and wanted to ask if there are any people here who were involved in the founding of the WHATWG, could put me in touch with such people or could simply tell me something about the history of the WHATWG themselves. It doesn't matter how small or subjective these stories are, but it would help me a lot and maybe it would help to organize the great history of the web and present it to other people. I would be very happy to hear from people.
Best regards from L√ºneburg 
Leonard :)

About the [Disclosures regarding contributions](https://whatwg.org/ipr-policy#561-disclosures-regarding-contributions) part of the WHATWG Intellectual Property Rights Policy: I notice it says this (emphasis added):

> <@annevk:matrix.org> Dominic Farolino: well you could imagine it being exposed to the callback so whoever is writing the callback doesn't need to know about who is subscribing directly

Hmm yeah that is interesting. My gut reaction is that something external like AsyncContext is best to handle this. Exposing things like AC/AS within the callbacks seems potentially useful, but I am not sure how we'd do it. We don't want to store per-subscription state on the Observable itself (see discussion around https://github.com/WICG/observable/issues/22#issuecomment-1804938312). So the alternative would be to somehow set the callback `this` value to some intangible per-subscription object that holds onto, for now, the signal supplied at subscription time. That seems a little funky though.

[09:19:59.0990] <Dominic Farolino>
I guess another option would be to just invoke the next callback with the signal as the last argument every time, but that seems wasteful and not scalable.
