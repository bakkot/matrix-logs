Hello, could someone tell what does mean:
> The insertion point is relative to the position of the character immediately after it, it is not an absolute offset into the input stream.

Why not absolute?

PSA: About https://git-pulse.github.io/snapshots/ — a while back I added the WebKit repo to the set of repos it tracks, and yesterday I added the https://github.com/chromium/chromium mirror and https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev mirror.

The Chromium and Gecko mirrors don’t use GitHub for patch reviews, so the PR stats for them aren’t relevant — but the committer stats are. And the [Chromium numbers](https://git-pulse.github.io/snapshots/chromium-chromium-2024-05-31-pulse.html) are [so exceptional](https://git-pulse.github.io/snapshots/?project=chromium_chromium) that it makes me wonder if what my tool is seeing and reporting is actually accurate —

- 13131 commits to main per month
- 1310 unique committers per month
- 11738 total unique committers over the entire repo history
- 49 unique new first-time committers each month

sunil: I don't know.

[01:40:43.0573] <annevk>
sunil: I think you're correct that it's supposed to work although I'm not sure to what extent we actively considered shared/service workers at the time. I don't recall.

[01:42:20.0539] <sunil>
Thanks annevk, Do you know who could have more idea on this?

[01:45:25.0990] <sunil>
annevk: I am implementing this in Firefox and trying to check if it would be helpful to extend the wpt to  service workers as well. It wouldn't add much value if other browsers do not fully support it for workers though.

These numbers seem pretty believable to me.

sunil: I suspect the most straightforward way to find out is to write those tests and run them

OK — good to have that confirmation. And I’m glad now to have finally added the repo to set that tool monitors. The numbers are more interesting relative to other projects (beyond just the absolute numbers)
