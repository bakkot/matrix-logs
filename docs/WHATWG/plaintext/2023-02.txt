maybe we could call it “The Second System”…

[00:52:15.0697] <sideshowbarker>
or if we’re really optimizing for irony, “Web4”

[00:53:25.0437] <sideshowbarker>
or else just skip to “Web5” (and also create some entertaining narrative for why we skipped past “Web4”)

[00:56:23.0383] <sideshowbarker>
anyway, this rightly seems like something we should have seriously started working on already — and I’ve not heard any sound objections to it other than some assertions that the performance benefits wouldn’t be significant enough to merit the spec work and implementation work required

but as Hixie says in one of his tweets, _“The goal is simplicity and developer ergonomics, more than performance”_

WABI

"applications could ship with their own implementations of high-level concepts like layout, widgets, and gestures" seems like an anti-goal to me.

[05:58:10.0698] <Domenic>
And not one any other successful platform has embraced

[06:39:44.0482] <sideshowbarker>
I think Flutter at least has already essentially embraced it, for their Web output — at least as an option.

See https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/web/renderers — the CanvasKit renderer: https://skia.org/docs/user/modules/canvaskit/, which amounts to every app shipping with its own embedded layout engine (Skia)

I feel like I have a lot of thoughts myself, but also - I kind of don't get at all how aria fits in that particular mix really

[08:12:01.0441] <bkardell>
well, I guess "at all" is an overstatement really

[08:14:18.0595] <bkardell>
but like - it feels like a lot of the industry was trying to go in a not totally dissimilar direction around 2004 before whatwg... like, lots of VMs with core and then a thing atop trying to add an application version of a markup maybe - flex/flash, java/jfx, silverlight/xaml ... no?
