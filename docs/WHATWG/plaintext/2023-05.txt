Thanks. It sounds like that issue was invalid from the start. I'll review Fetch and see about petitioning implementations to support it.

Domenic: on reflection, it should probably be `Document.parseHTML()`. If we ever wanted to tackle non-HTML cases we could do a whole swath of XML-named variants.

Dominic Farolino: did you forget to push in https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/pull/8759? If not, my first comment still applies I think. Please clarify if you think it doesn't.

[05:48:28.0474] <Dominic Farolino>
Oh hmmm... yeah it looks like I did. Sorry, let me fix that in a bit.

[05:49:49.0585] <Dominic Farolino>
I'm pretty sure I made the commit somewhere... maybe on a different computer & never pushed it heh

Domenic: not sure I'm totally onboard yet, but it might be interesting to figure out how often `stopImmediatePropagation()` is used and whether we could make it controlled by yet another boolean controlled by the dispatcher

bkardell: oops, did I leave too early

[09:32:38.0358] <smaug>
I'll try to review the pr

[09:32:51.0821] <smaug>
ping me if I don't

(I was traveling last week)

nope, I just said what it was really and please have a look

[09:55:02.0283] <bkardell>
annevk: sorry about that - i think I fixed the things you mentioned last week. I expect that line wrapping bit is gonna be a general thing to fix in the other :dir PR too

(in the silly 9088 one https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9088)

bkardell: it would be great if any nits are fixed ahead of general review as the nits tend to make reviews very noisy

[10:53:22.0571] <annevk>
Andreu Botella: thanks again for https://github.com/whatwg/url/pull/735#issuecomment-1441503315! I will try to find some time to write tests soon

[10:53:34.0340] <Andreu Botella>
sure!

You mean on the dir one?

[13:08:55.0053] <bkardell>
> <@bkardell:igalia.com> You mean on the dir one?

hopefully done with my last commit!  Unless I've misunderstood, which is totally possible

Anyone been seeing some weird ref box formatting like this?

Probably related to https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/271

[23:29:22.0694] <zcorpan>
annevk: I guess https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/392#issuecomment-510855073 has been addressed?

[23:34:12.0375] <annevk>
zcorpan: at least partially I think, but it's been a while and HTML's terminology around this changed.

[23:34:59.0884] <annevk>
zcorpan: it used to do checks on the number of top-level bcs in a bcg, I think, but again, it's been a while.

[23:43:18.0916] <zcorpan>
annevk: ok yeah, seems to be step 6 in https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/#restricting-the-text-fragment

This room is now also being logged to https://archive.matrix.org/r/whatwg:matrix.org

The logs have timestamp links — but somewhat unfortunately, the links are matrix.to URLs rather than being URLs for the archive.matrix.org logs themselves.

So that means that anybody wanting to view the messages needs to have a Matrix client installed in order to read them.

That seems… suboptimal — so I’m hoping there will eventually be a way to share timestamp URLs to the archive.matrix.org logs themselves. (I’ve pinged the maintainers already to ask.)
