Dominic Farolino: did you forget to push in https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/pull/8759? If not, my first comment still applies I think. Please clarify if you think it doesn't.

Oh hmmm... yeah it looks like I did. Sorry, let me fix that in a bit.

I'm pretty sure I made the commit somewhere... maybe on a different computer & never pushed it heh
