Anyone with Safari? I wonder if it has changed behavior regarding https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2429

I get `log: 195` on Safari Technology Preview (Release 199 (Safari 18.0, WebKit 19619.1.22.5)) and Safari (17.5 (19618.2.12.11.6))

Following up on this, for my usable Dialog component, I eventually added a custom function to loop back to first focusable element and visa versa to encapsulate the tabbing. 

I have seen some concerns about accessibility where it is trapping users to make a decision when they want to move to address bar or other browser controls but it works for me because my Dialog always has escape method that can not be blocked.
