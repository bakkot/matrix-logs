Anyone with Safari? I wonder if it has changed behavior regarding https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2429 

[04:18:24.0322] <arai>
I get `log: 195` on Safari Technology Preview (Release 199 (Safari 18.0, WebKit 19619.1.22.5)) and Safari (17.5 (19618.2.12.11.6))

Following up on this, for my usable Dialog component, I eventually added a custom function to loop back to first focusable element and visa versa to encapsulate the tabbing. 

I have seen some concerns about accessibility where it is trapping users to make a decision when they want to move to address bar or other browser controls but it works for me because my Dialog always has escape method that can not be blocked.

Not with Safari but I've been poking around this in webkit https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/31055

[02:31:57.0754] <Yoav Weiss>
My impression is that all image loading is sync

[02:32:05.0796] <Yoav Weiss>
(I'm trying to fix that)

[08:20:33.0882] <smaug>
But the spec issue hints that some stuff in webkit is async

Adam Rice: Any more thought on the stream close question above? Why is close() alone not sufficient? When constructing a ReadableStream  it is unexpected that you need to call controller.byobRequest.respond(0) after close() when no data is enqueued or risk causing the stream reader to hang.

Sorry, I don't remember what the reason was, and I haven't been able to find the original discussion.

I suggest filing an issue on whatwg/streams. Async discussion will likely get more participants and someone might be able to help. And if there is no good answer we can use the issue to track fixing it.

(I myself have not really been able to follow the issue across the multiple chat messages which often come in while I'm afk :))

https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-preventdefault - this mentions that calling `preventDefault` can have no effect. Does that mean `event.defaultPrevented` will remain false?

[07:31:42.0378] <Jake Archibald>
Or does it just mean that the dispatcher of the event may do nothing with that information

[11:30:00.0719] <TabAtkins>
I think the latter.

In case the cancelable attribute is falsy, or if the passive listener flag is set, it indeed does nothing.

Hello, I have recently been working on trying to implement `console.table` for the LadyBird browser and I have came across the `console` WHATWG repo. Unfortunately, there was no algorithm defined for `console.table`; so, I decided to investigate how Chromium and Firefox implement it and tried to figure out the algorithm. I created a pull request to https://github.com/whatwg/console/pull/237 that tries to describe the algorithm. Please let me know of your comments and concerns about this since this is my first ever contribution to Whatwg.

I just found out that implementations use a decimal library to implement `<input type=number>` while HTML says nothing of the sort. Didn't realize that when initially reporting https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/80. Does anyone know more about this?

We had to do this in jsdom to pass web platform tests.

[10:43:33.0737] <annevk>
So maybe someone wrote some non-floating-point-compliant WPTs and everyone just decided to copy in a decimal lib? lol

[10:53:14.0539] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
I mean if the spec doesn't define behaviour, and everyone thinks it's the right behaviour from a UX point-of-view, then making the tests pass is unsurprising. Or people blindly following the tests, unless it goes against the spec. Or just completely blindly following the tests.


2024-08-15
[18:05:17.0595] <Domenic>
I admit not reading the spec closely when we implemented in jsdom but I kind of assumed the spec was based on mathematical infinite-precision numbers.

[00:14:49.0152] <annevk>
I assumed that for a long time too, but looking at it today it just references floating-point math?

[01:16:33.0469] <Domenic>
I'm not sure, I think it only references floating-point for the parsing/serialization?

[01:17:06.0484] <Domenic>
The tests are for stepUp() etc. IIRC which says "Let value be the result of adding delta to value."

[02:22:21.0916] <annevk>
Ah, I guess that's fair.

[02:22:53.0300] <annevk>
Still, some additional clarity on this wouldn't hurt. Perhaps once we sort out numbers in Infra.

[05:11:37.0097] <sideshowbarker>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> So maybe someone wrote some non-floating-point-compliant WPTs and everyone just decided to copy in a decimal lib? lol

Are the relevant tests https://wpt.fyi/results/html/semantics/forms/the-input-element/number.html? or somewhere else?

[05:14:20.0827] <sideshowbarker>
hmm, I guess it’s probably not those, because Ladybird passes most of those

[05:17:34.0613] <sideshowbarker>
Anyway, I believe Ladybird implements the core `<input type=number>` requirements per-spec — that, is Ladybird uses a double parser. And so, if the WPTs don’t match the spec requirements, then Ladybird should be failing those

annevk janbrasna Can I add you as reviewers for this PR?

[08:15:58.0144] <annevk>
Gasim Gasimzada: I think Dominic Farolino or one of the other editors is prolly better suited to review, maybe Domenic but I suspect he's very busy; if all that fails I could maybe take a look, but I'd have to ramp up on the whole subject so I'd rather not

[08:46:45.0555] <Dominic Farolino>
Ah, yeah I've been notified about the PR, just haven't had time to look at it yet. Coming back from vacation this week, so still warming up

[08:55:18.0691] <annevk>
Samesies. Been going pretty well thus far, but I'm suspecting it's because a lot of other people are away which makes it easier.

zcorpan: I want to confirm something about https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/semantics/embedded-content/the-iframe-element/iframe-loading-lazy-reload-navigation-reload.html#L9-L10. Is this statement true because reloads don't go through the "normal" #navigate path, and it is only the normal #navigate path that clears the lazyload resumption steps? (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/C#beginning-navigation:lazy-load-resumption-steps). Is that the idea?

Thanks! No rush! Just wanted to know who to set in the Checklist for "At least two implementers are interested (and none opposed):"

[09:21:13.0713] <annevk>
Gasim Gasimzada: ah, that part you want to lobby implementers for. But I if it's documenting what's already implemented you don't strictly need that.

Right. https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#reload doesn't call "navigate"

I'm told that AWS API Gateway exhibits a weird behaviour: it splits a list-based field (`Access-Control-Request-Headers`) into multiple field lines. Example:
```http
Access-Control-Request-Headers: bar,baz,foo

it's allowed; see https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.3 (emphasis mine):
> a sender MUST NOT generate multiple field lines with the same name in a message (whether in the headers or trailers) or append a field line when a field line of the same name already exists in the message, **_unless_ that field's definition allows multiple field line values to be recombined as a comma-separated list** (i.e., at least one alternative of the field's definition allows a comma-separated list, **such as an ABNF rule of #(values) defined in [Section 5.6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#abnf.extension)**).

[Section 5.6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.6.1) defines "_a #rule extension to the ABNF rules of [RFC5234](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#RFC5234)… for defining comma-delimited lists of elements… and optional whitespace_".

[`Access-Control-Request-Headers` is registered](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields/http-fields.xhtml#field-names) with reference to WHATWG Fetch, which [describes its values](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-new-header-syntax) as ABNF `1#field-name`, where ["ABNF" explicitly includes HTTP `#`](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#infrastructure).
