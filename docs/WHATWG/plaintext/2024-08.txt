Anyone with Safari? I wonder if it has changed behavior regarding https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2429 

[04:18:24.0322] <arai>
I get `log: 195` on Safari Technology Preview (Release 199 (Safari 18.0, WebKit 19619.1.22.5)) and Safari (17.5 (19618.2.12.11.6))

Following up on this, for my usable Dialog component, I eventually added a custom function to loop back to first focusable element and visa versa to encapsulate the tabbing. 

I have seen some concerns about accessibility where it is trapping users to make a decision when they want to move to address bar or other browser controls but it works for me because my Dialog always has escape method that can not be blocked.

Not with Safari but I've been poking around this in webkit https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/31055

[02:31:57.0754] <Yoav Weiss>
My impression is that all image loading is sync

[02:32:05.0796] <Yoav Weiss>
(I'm trying to fix that)

[08:20:33.0882] <smaug>
But the spec issue hints that some stuff in webkit is async

Adam Rice: Any more thought on the stream close question above? Why is close() alone not sufficient? When constructing a ReadableStream  it is unexpected that you need to call controller.byobRequest.respond(0) after close() when no data is enqueued or risk causing the stream reader to hang.

Sorry, I don't remember what the reason was, and I haven't been able to find the original discussion.

I suggest filing an issue on whatwg/streams. Async discussion will likely get more participants and someone might be able to help. And if there is no good answer we can use the issue to track fixing it.

(I myself have not really been able to follow the issue across the multiple chat messages which often come in while I'm afk :))

[07:30:59.0090] <Jake Archibald>
https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-preventdefault - this mentions that calling `preventDefault` can have no effect. Does that mean `event.defaultPrevented` will remain false?

[07:31:42.0378] <Jake Archibald>
Or does it just mean that the dispatcher of the event may do nothing with that information

[11:30:00.0719] <TabAtkins>
I think the latter.

In case the cancelable attribute is falsy, or if the passive listener flag is set, it indeed does nothing.

Hello, I have recently been working on trying to implement `console.table` for the LadyBird browser and I have came across the `console` WHATWG repo. Unfortunately, there was no algorithm defined for `console.table`; so, I decided to investigate how Chromium and Firefox implement it and tried to figure out the algorithm. I created a pull request to https://github.com/whatwg/console/pull/237 that tries to describe the algorithm. Please let me know of your comments and concerns about this since this is my first ever contribution to Whatwg.

I just found out that implementations use a decimal library to implement `<input type=number>` while HTML says nothing of the sort. Didn't realize that when initially reporting https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/80. Does anyone know more about this?

We had to do this in jsdom to pass web platform tests.

[10:43:33.0737] <annevk>
So maybe someone wrote some non-floating-point-compliant WPTs and everyone just decided to copy in a decimal lib? lol

[10:53:14.0539] <Sam Sneddon [:gsnedders]>
I mean if the spec doesn't define behaviour, and everyone thinks it's the right behaviour from a UX point-of-view, then making the tests pass is unsurprising. Or people blindly following the tests, unless it goes against the spec. Or just completely blindly following the tests.


2024-08-15
[18:05:17.0595] <Domenic>
I admit not reading the spec closely when we implemented in jsdom but I kind of assumed the spec was based on mathematical infinite-precision numbers.

[00:14:49.0152] <annevk>
I assumed that for a long time too, but looking at it today it just references floating-point math?

[01:16:33.0469] <Domenic>
I'm not sure, I think it only references floating-point for the parsing/serialization?

[01:17:06.0484] <Domenic>
The tests are for stepUp() etc. IIRC which says "Let value be the result of adding delta to value."

[02:22:21.0916] <annevk>
Ah, I guess that's fair.

[02:22:53.0300] <annevk>
Still, some additional clarity on this wouldn't hurt. Perhaps once we sort out numbers in Infra.

[05:11:37.0097] <sideshowbarker>
> <@annevk:matrix.org> So maybe someone wrote some non-floating-point-compliant WPTs and everyone just decided to copy in a decimal lib? lol

Are the relevant tests https://wpt.fyi/results/html/semantics/forms/the-input-element/number.html? or somewhere else?

[05:14:20.0827] <sideshowbarker>
hmm, I guess it‚Äôs probably not those, because Ladybird passes most of those

[05:17:34.0613] <sideshowbarker>
Anyway, I believe Ladybird implements the core `<input type=number>` requirements per-spec ‚Äî that, is Ladybird uses a double parser. And so, if the WPTs don‚Äôt match the spec requirements, then Ladybird should be failing those

annevk janbrasna Can I add you as reviewers for this PR?

Gasim Gasimzada: ah, that part you want to lobby implementers for. But I if it's documenting what's already implemented you don't strictly need that.

If anyone has particular topics to discuss at TPAC, we're holding another WHATUP: https://github.com/whatwg/meta/issues/326

[23:58:45.0573] <annevk>
Domenic: further thoughts on https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10564?

[00:06:40.0467] <Domenic>
I think our existing "(the empty string)" convention is good. I would prefer you correct the single capitalized variant you found. I think we could contemplate adding quotes to all keywords (not just in the tables, but elsewhere too) but I think that opens up a lot of questions, e.g. do we do the same for attribute names or element local names?

[00:07:06.0649] <Domenic>
I'm unclear why we're revisiting this months after Keith's original PRs settled everything on a single style.

[00:16:24.0383] <annevk>
I guess I'll do that for now, but I had missed at the time we included parenthesis here. I think that's a rather confusing notation.

[00:19:26.0233] <annevk>
(And I do think it might make sense to distinguish a node's local name from a reference to the node itself.)

[08:19:51.0202] <Jake Archibald>
Anyone know where the click behaviour on `<button disabled>` is specified?

[08:22:57.0468] <Jake Archibald>
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#enabling-and-disabling-form-controls:-the-disabled-attribute

> A form control that is disabled must prevent any click events that are queued on the user interaction task source from being dispatched on the element.

But that doesn't seem to cover how it prevents propagation of click events dispatched on child elements

[08:25:39.0223] <annevk>
Jake Archibald: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1567 is related and generally search for "activation behavior" in whatwg/html; unfortunately that's messy and nobody has taken the time to clean it up as-of-yet

https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/10032 is some recent dsicussion

[14:48:58.0428] <TabAtkins>
Domenic / annevk : I'm doing some refactoring in Bikeshed, and realized that, although the "whatwg" group is listed as requiring Privacy and Security sections, all WHATWG specs didn't actually trigger that check in the code, due to a case mismatch (was expecting `Group: whatwg`, but all your specs have `Group: WHATWG`). Now that I'm fixing that (as a side-effect of some other bits), almost all WHATWG specs end up triggering the warning.

[14:49:18.0802] <TabAtkins>
Do y'all want WHATWG to require privacy/security sections? I can turn it off if not.

[14:53:58.0275] <TabAtkins>
(Well, I'm turning it off for now anyway; no reason to suddenly start making specs fail unexpectedly. Let me know if you'd like me to turn it back *on*.)

[14:57:25.0029] <TabAtkins>
(it looks like the check was added back in 2015 by Mike West <https://github.com/speced/bikeshed/commit/89f5bdc7f12294f5c59890ee19d9ee5619c57a66>, I'm not sure if y'all were even aware of it)


2024-08-21
[18:01:23.0646] <Domenic>
Turning it off, at least for now, sounds good; thank you!
