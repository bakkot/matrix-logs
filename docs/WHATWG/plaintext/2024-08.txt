Anyone with Safari? I wonder if it has changed behavior regarding https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2429

I get `log: 195` on Safari Technology Preview (Release 199 (Safari 18.0, WebKit 19619.1.22.5)) and Safari (17.5 (19618.2.12.11.6))

Following up on this, for my usable Dialog component, I eventually added a custom function to loop back to first focusable element and visa versa to encapsulate the tabbing. 

I have seen some concerns about accessibility where it is trapping users to make a decision when they want to move to address bar or other browser controls but it works for me because my Dialog always has escape method that can not be blocked.

Not with Safari but I've been poking around this in webkit https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/31055

My impression is that all image loading is sync

(I'm trying to fix that)

But the spec issue hints that some stuff in webkit is async
