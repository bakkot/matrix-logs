Anyone with Safari? I wonder if it has changed behavior regarding https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2429 

[04:18:24.0322] <arai>
I get `log: 195` on Safari Technology Preview (Release 199 (Safari 18.0, WebKit 19619.1.22.5)) and Safari (17.5 (19618.2.12.11.6))

Following up on this, for my usable Dialog component, I eventually added a custom function to loop back to first focusable element and visa versa to encapsulate the tabbing. 

I have seen some concerns about accessibility where it is trapping users to make a decision when they want to move to address bar or other browser controls but it works for me because my Dialog always has escape method that can not be blocked.

Not with Safari but I've been poking around this in webkit https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/31055

My impression is that all image loading is sync

[02:32:05.0796] <Yoav Weiss>
(I'm trying to fix that)

[08:20:33.0882] <smaug>
But the spec issue hints that some stuff in webkit is async

Adam Rice: Any more thought on the stream close question above? Why is close() alone not sufficient? When constructing a ReadableStream  it is unexpected that you need to call controller.byobRequest.respond(0) after close() when no data is enqueued or risk causing the stream reader to hang.

Sorry, I don't remember what the reason was, and I haven't been able to find the original discussion.

I suggest filing an issue on whatwg/streams. Async discussion will likely get more participants and someone might be able to help. And if there is no good answer we can use the issue to track fixing it.

(I myself have not really been able to follow the issue across the multiple chat messages which often come in while I'm afk :))

https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-preventdefault - this mentions that calling `preventDefault` can have no effect. Does that mean `event.defaultPrevented` will remain false?

[07:31:42.0378] <Jake Archibald>
Or does it just mean that the dispatcher of the event may do nothing with that information

[11:30:00.0719] <TabAtkins>
I think the latter.

Welcome! Maybe https://wpc.guide/ is of interest

I have gone through the material and I think it will be of great benefit. There is a lot to learn, thankyou so much, I really appreciate your effort üëçÔ∏è.

In case the cancelable attribute is falsy, or if the passive listener flag is set, it indeed does nothing.

annevk: Regarding https://github.com/whatwg/url/issues/815#issuecomment-2275009761 , do you have a recollection of why the ASCII asterisk and double quote are allowed in the domain name by the URL Standard?

Hello, I have recently been working on trying to implement `console.table` for the LadyBird browser and I have came across the `console` WHATWG repo. Unfortunately, there was no algorithm defined for `console.table`; so, I decided to investigate how Chromium and Firefox implement it and tried to figure out the algorithm. I created a pull request to https://github.com/whatwg/console/pull/237 that tries to describe the algorithm. Please let me know of your comments and concerns about this since this is my first ever contribution to Whatwg.

I just found out that implementations use a decimal library to implement `<input type=number>` while HTML says nothing of the sort. Didn't realize that when initially reporting https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/80. Does anyone know more about this?
