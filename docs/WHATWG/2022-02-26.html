As I have been working on this it has occurred to me that I may be introducing some ambiguity that can lead to confusion to those who read the list. It concerns attributes and when they first appear in a specification.

Lets use 'width' as the example. The width attribute first appears in HTML 1.0. As that specification didn't have global attributes (if you don't include %linkattributes), each element contains the definition for the attributes applied to it. The width attribute is applied to more than one element, so I have just been stating that the width attribute originates in the HTML 1.0 DTD. The same is true of each version up to 3.2. The 4.0 specification is the first to define global attributes, and width is not included among them. Neither is it included in the global attributes of the HTML 5 specification.

I know this is common knowledge, but it brings me to the point of this post. I will use the forms elements button and input as the example here. The attributes name, type and value are common to both elements in 4.0. However, the button element didn't exist in 2.0 or 3.2. So, should I say that the name, type and value attributes first appeared in 2.0 for the button element, or should I say that they first existed in 4.0 for the button element?

Edit: Technically, name goes back to 1.0 as it was used in the named anchor (a) element (now replaced with the id attribute).</td></tr>

Since they are historically found in specifications for different versions there really isn't any other way to list them. If you look at the list you will see that it includes both valid and invalid tags and attributes, with valid being represented by bold text and invalid represented by strike text. The entire focus of this list is to hold in one place a quick reference for those who are looking to see if a particular tag or attribute is still valid, or just to see what tags and attributes have existed in the past and at present. This is the reason I want to know the best way to deal with attributes as they pertain to specific elements. I am not trying to introduce versioning into HTML5.</td></tr>
