Now I see that the Step 7 you mentioned earlier implements a weaker version of the STD3 check that stopped my attack. However, I found another issue showing that whatwg-url probably violated (at least the spirit of) UTS#46. UTS#46 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...<br>U+2260 ( ≠ ) NOT EQUAL TO<br>U+226E ( ≮ ) NOT LESS-THAN<br>U+226F ( ≯ ) NOT GREATER-THAN</p>
<p>... If an implementation uses <code>UseSTD3ASCIIRules=false</code> but disallows any of these three ASCII characters, then it must also disallow the corresponding precomposed character for its negation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The URL standard forbids <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>, so I feel <code>≮</code> and <code>≯</code> should be banned as well. I am happy to open a GitHub issue on this (smaller issue).</p>
