I kind of just want to sketch in the basics of how it works at the moment, but it would be good to start with a model that isn't total nonsense. 

So I'm leaning towards a model where the behaviour is explained as "in a sandbox, objects are accessed through a transparent wrapper object. When getting a property, if the property is defined on the wrapper, return that. Otherwise check if the property is defined on the wrapped object and, if it is, and the wrapped object is a platform object, and the property is part of the interface definition for the wrapped object, or is an internal slot, return the wrapped property value if it's an object, or the primitive value if it's not. When setting a property, check if the wrapped object is a platform object, and the property is part of the interface for that platform object, then act as if setting the property on the wrapped object. Otherwise set the property on the wrapper."

Does that make any sense whatsoever as a model or is it going to run into insurmountable difficulties (I think it's similar to the actual Gecko implementation, but I'm not an expert)? If it does make sense, how to fit it into the formalism? I don't mind the wrapper objects being "magical", but does it make sense to claim that the sandbox itself is a realm and the wrapped objects are part of a different realm? That kind of makes sense at a high level, and matches how we want to expose it in the BiDi protocol but is it going cause problems with some invariants at the spec level?</td></tr>

<li>In a Readable/WritableStream's <code>start()</code> implementation (also in <code>read()</code> or <code>write()</code>) I sometimes want to gracefully cancel or abort the stream. For example, if a WritableStream is passed data of a type it doesn't handle, but I want the stream implementation to do some post-processing on the data it already received. One can't use the client-facing <code>cancel</code> or <code>abort</code> methods on the streams at these points, because the stream is typically locked. You can call <code>controller.error</code>, but (at least in Node 17.1.0's implementation and in the current web-streams-polyfill), this throws an error outside the scope of the stream implementation (so it can't be observed/caught by the implementation's <code>cancel</code> or <code>abort</code> routines). I'd be interested to hear whether this design is deliberate and what kinds of worksarounds I might consider.</li>
