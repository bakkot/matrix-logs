For example all the navigation changes in HTML have totally broken WebDriver so the spec won't even build because there were breaking changes in the "API surface" of the HTML spec. And on the one hand, I get it that we want to make these changes and "just let the rest of the ecosystem deal with the fallout" is probably the only practical way to get it landed at all, but on the other hand you wouldn't get away with that kind of thing in a software project.</td></tr>
