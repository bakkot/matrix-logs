But as far as the MDN side goes, a specific problem we chronically run into is that historically (and still) we have only had Deprecated and Obsolete flags. The current policy is to completely stop using Obsolete flag and only use the Deprecated flag. But if we mark a feature as Deprecated when the relevant spec doesn’t actually indicate that feature is deprecated, then we get reports from (sometimes angry) developers who somewhat-rightly take issue with MDN saying that something’s deprecated when it’s actually not.</td></tr>

So I guess if we were to really want to venture into doing something similar for methods and properties, we’d ideally want to have some similar documented rationale guiding the choices.</td></tr>
