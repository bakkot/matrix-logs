Anyway:</p>
<p>We have an extension that opens two windows side-by-side and records the screen for user research. One of these windows opens an arbitrary document. With Manifest V3 coming and improvements to web standards we are looking to move away from the extension in favour of just a website.</p>
<p>We've had good initial success with <code><a href="http://window.open">window.open</a></code> to open and position the two windows side by side. However, we've recently realised that COOP(when the origin sets same-origin) puts a spanner in the works. We really only need the ability to open popups, position them, close them, and change their URL. It seems that with COOP we are dead in the water on the closing and changing URL components of this however.</p>
<p>So I guess my question is: With a more widespread deployment of COOP is there no way to achieve our goals here(outside of keeping an extension?).</p>
</blockquote></mx-reply>In general, if a website does not want you to control their content, you cannot. In particular if they use COOP to deny you from having such control. One day we might even make COOP the default, like it should have been from the beginning, so that websites have to give up such control affirmatively.</td></tr>
