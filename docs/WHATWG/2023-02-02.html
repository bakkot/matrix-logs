That code, or something equivalent, will still be needed---it will just be built by framework developers. And re-built, over and over and over, with the same mistakes repeated and missed and some of the frameworks good at using the a11y parts of the "ABI" and some bad and some doing a good job at meeting user expectations and some bad. For better or for worse, to build a successful UI framework you <em>need</em> a lot of code complexity---witness the thousands of people-years spent on them throughout history, from Win32 to WPF to Cocoa to Carbon to the web. Ones built by smaller teams, e.g. Flutter or the various Java or Linux GUI-framework-from-scratch attempts, tend to be painful for end users. GUI frameworks are just a hard problem; wishing you could start over and do it better this time is, IMO, not a good use of the tech industry's collective effort. The web works, and we even have escape hatches like wasm and WebGPU on top of it for cases like video games or CAD software or porting native apps to the web or whatever. But if you want a set of controls, loading primitives, etc., what we have is good and recreating it will not work well.</td></tr>

For the rest, are developers not putting in enough effort, or is it too hard to put in enough effort because the web's UI framework is bad comparatively? I could see it being the latter. I doubt having everyone download a UI framework per web app, created by indie teams, would be a good solution though.</td></tr>

It's a combination of the fact that the app stores tell us we should and the app store is by the same people who make the OS, and sometimes the device too so as customers people say "seems legit".  It's the fact that sometimes people <em>like</em> the app store... If you're looking for a thing you open over and over again it's very handy - you <em>think</em> of it as an app and you don't want to search the web for that... You want maybe somewhere where you can see how many other people got it and read some reviews and comparisons -- a lot like why you would use a brick and mortar store... You have some sense that you can learn somethign about the quality. In practice I think that is mostly bunk - we need to do better than what we do, but yeah, same reason people like amazon reviews/purchase data, etc. You can't get that easily today with the web. But also then we built this whole movement where businesses which would do great with a PWA and who could build the great UX, etc still think they gotta build the native thing and use their site to push you to it, which again makes users think "oh, I guess that's better"...
