That code, or something equivalent, will still be needed---it will just be built by framework developers. And re-built, over and over and over, with the same mistakes repeated and missed and some of the frameworks good at using the a11y parts of the "ABI" and some bad and some doing a good job at meeting user expectations and some bad. For better or for worse, to build a successful UI framework you <em>need</em> a lot of code complexity---witness the thousands of people-years spent on them throughout history, from Win32 to WPF to Cocoa to Carbon to the web. Ones built by smaller teams, e.g. Flutter or the various Java or Linux GUI-framework-from-scratch attempts, tend to be painful for end users. GUI frameworks are just a hard problem; wishing you could start over and do it better this time is, IMO, not a good use of the tech industry's collective effort. The web works, and we even have escape hatches like wasm and WebGPU on top of it for cases like video games or CAD software or porting native apps to the web or whatever. But if you want a set of controls, loading primitives, etc., what we have is good and recreating it will not work well.</td></tr>

For the rest, are developers not putting in enough effort, or is it too hard to put in enough effort because the web's UI framework is bad comparatively? I could see it being the latter. I doubt having everyone download a UI framework per web app, created by indie teams, would be a good solution though.</td></tr>
