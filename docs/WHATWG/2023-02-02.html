<p>That is, the thing at the end of the URL is a single binary, a single executable, completely just object code — a single <code>.wasm</code> file/resource</p>
<p>And so then for that app, all that the browser does is just to load that single binary into memory and execute it — execute it in the existing WebAssembly execution environment that all browsers already have.</p>
<p>And that’s all in contrast to what browsers need to do now with the current HTML/DOM+JS+CSS stack, which is: browsers must load three different things into memory: they must a DOM tree/object, a JavaScript global object, and CSS cascade/Stylesheet object —&nbsp;and then also keep those three in sync through all the DOM mutations and everything</p>

  <tr class="msg" id="L6"><td class="ts-cell"><a class="ts" href="#L6" alt="Wed Feb 01 2023 17:04:23 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)">01:04</a></td><td class="nick-cell"><div class="m-ov">&lt;<span class="nick nick-16" title="@sideshowbarker:matrix.org">sideshowbarker</span>&gt;</div></td><td class="msg-cell">But that analogy is not at all exact, because in that case the binary is an architecture-specific binary that can only run on a single platform —&nbsp;that is, a Windows binary, or a Linux binary, or a macOS binary.

But a WABI binary is not architecture-specific but instead is a portable binary in every way that WASM binaries already are</td></tr>

  <tr class="msg" id="L8"><td class="ts-cell"><a class="ts" href="#L8" alt="Wed Feb 01 2023 17:11:05 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)">01:11</a></td><td class="nick-cell"><div class="m-ov">&lt;<span class="nick nick-16" title="@sideshowbarker:matrix.org">sideshowbarker</span>&gt;</div></td><td class="msg-cell">And at least I can say from experience as a patch contributor to Chrome, that loading code is just incredibly complicated and intimidating to try to work on. Chrome has an entire team that’s devoted to just that loading code.</td></tr>
  <tr class="msg" id="L9"><td class="ts-cell"><a class="ts" href="#L9" alt="Wed Feb 01 2023 17:14:50 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)">01:14</a></td><td class="nick-cell"><div class="m-ov">&lt;<span class="nick nick-16" title="@sideshowbarker:matrix.org">sideshowbarker</span>&gt;</div></td><td class="msg-cell">And for web apps (as opposed to documents), all that loading code arguably should be unnecessary anyway —&nbsp;it’s just a side effect of having needed to bolt an application-execution environment on top of a model that’s not fundamentally designed for running apps but instead is just designed for laying out documents</td></tr>
  <tr class="msg" id="L10"><td class="ts-cell"><a class="ts" href="#L10" alt="Wed Feb 01 2023 17:19:01 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)">01:19</a></td><td class="nick-cell"><div class="m-ov">&lt;<span class="nick nick-16" title="@sideshowbarker:matrix.org">sideshowbarker</span>&gt;</div></td><td class="msg-cell">So there is huge value alone in just being able to cut out the need for all that loading code, and all its complexity, and (over the long run) all its ongoing maintenance cost in implementations. (Though, because this is the web, implementations would also forever need to still retain all that code — to run all the content that exists on the web now — but over the long run, developers building web apps would mostly move to targeting WABI instead, and most web apps would be running in the WABI execution environment instead.)</td></tr>
