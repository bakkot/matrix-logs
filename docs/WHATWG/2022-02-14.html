It is supposed to be as complete a list as possible of every tag and attribute that has existed in the history of HTML and the W3. I am finding that with the previous versions of the DTD (the SGML based ones through 4.01) it is easy to determine what attributes were given to each element. In the Living Standard version, being removed from the SGML requirement for things to be so specific, the specification is written very differently. It has become difficult to determine exactly which attributes should be listed with a given element, and which attributes from the past are no longer relevant. I am also having difficulty with finding a list of the onEvent attributes (such as onMouseDown) in the HTML 5 specification. Is there a concise list?</td></tr>

I am not saying Firefox is right and everyone else is wrong. I'm saying that there needs to be an agreed upon definition of proper rendering that all browsers should adhere to if they want to render web pages correctly. Then all web pages would look the same in every browser no matter what platform or browser the user has. Of course, there are limits, such as different screen size and resolutions. The authors of the web pages would have to ensure that they code the pages in such a way that it accommodates as many users as possible, realizing that there will be some users who simply won't see the page as intended.</td></tr>

I realize that the focus of the WHATWG may not be the same as the W3C, but this is the only forum I know of that has so many browser developers in one place.

They exist. The problem is that there are three different engines with different bugs. If you see rendering differences, then these are bugs in individual engines.</td></tr>

I haven't done it yet, but that's because I am still trying to get all of the data in. Once that is done I can worry about fallback fonts. That was my thinking. I guess I should remedy that now though.</td></tr>
