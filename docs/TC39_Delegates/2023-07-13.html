  <tr class="msg" id="L2"><td class="ts-cell"><a class="ts" href="#L2" alt="Wed Jul 12 2023 18:41:59 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)">01:41</a></td><td class="nick-cell"><div class="m-ov">&lt;<span class="nick nick-12" title="@justingrant:matrix.org">justingrant</span>&gt;</div></td><td class="msg-cell"><mx-reply><blockquote> it's so strange to me that IETF would explicitly <em>not</em> want to support sub-minute offsets</blockquote></mx-reply><p>(catching up) Here's more context around IETF's reasoning, and more generally why restricting offset time zones to minutes seems OK to me:</p>
<p>Existing RFC3339 timestamp strings (which the new IETF spec, aka "IXDTF", extends) only support HH:MM in the offset, e.g. <code>2023-07-12T14:06-07:00</code>. You can't use <code>07:00:01</code> or even <code>07:00:00</code> because parsers wouldn't recognize it. JS Date has the same same limit, BTW.</p>
<p>In the new IETF spec, they didn't want to change anything about the RFC3339 portion of the IXDTF timestamp, only the stuff in brackets after the timestamp is what's new.  Otherwise, existing RFC3339 parsers would break for the before-brackets portion. Of course, that's not necessarily related to what's in brackets. We could have different precision for the in-brackets portion because there's no legacy.</p>
<p>But with IXDTF, the rule is that the RFC3339 offset must match the offset of the time zone in brackets.  So <code>2020-01-01T00:00-05:00[America /Los_Angeles]</code> is considered an error because the offset doesn't match the time zone.</p>
<p>For named time zones that have sub-minute precision, the new IETF spec handles it by being flexible about what "match" means: if the bracketed time zone's offset, when rounded to HH:MM, matches the offset in the RFC3339 portion of the string, then there's no error produced.</p>
<p>So <code>1970-01-01T00:00-00:45[Africa/Monrovia]</code> is considered valid, even though Liberia's offset in 1970 was -00:44:30. The rounding hack simply tells the receiver not to throw an error in that case; it doesn't change the actual instant that the string represents. The instant described by "midnight on Jan 1 1970 in Liberia" is still 44:30 away from UNIX epoch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('1970-01-01T00:00-00:45[Africa/Monrovia]').toInstant();
// =&gt; 1970-01-01T00:44:30Z
</code></pre>
<p>Temporal does the same thing in reverse in <code>ZonedDateTime.p.toString()</code>: it formats the instant by rounding the offset to the nearest minute.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's how it works for named time zones. But what about offset time zones?</p>
<p>Because the offset in the RFC3339 portion of the string is constrained to HH:MM, the IETF folks felt that it'd be better to also limit the bracketed time zone to HH:MM too. There's nothing preventing us from extending the format in the future if there's customer demand, using the same rounding hack used for named time zones, so that <code>1970-01-01T00:00-00:45[-00:44:30]</code> would also be allowed.</p>
<p>But it's not clear (to me at least) that this customer demand will ever materialize. Offset time zones were really only added to Temporal and IXDTF for backwards compatibility with Java. It's not clear how much usage of offset time zones there will be in Temporal. Partly this is because all IANA time zones today are on 15-minute boundaries. Sub-minute offsets haven't been official in any country since the 1970s, and even then it was rare. And offset time zones intentionally dispense with the main value of time zones in Temporal: the ability to automatically adjust timestamps for DST and other time zone weirdness.</p>
<p>Also, there's a storage advantage. If offset time zones are limited to minutes, then a Temporal.TimeZone can fit in a 16-bit union: 12 bits for offset time zones (±24h at minute-precision), 10 bits for the index into ~600 named time zones, and one bit to choose between them. Sub-minute offsets would require 50% more bytes to support a use case with questionable demand.</p>
<p>Finally, any user who really needs an offset time zone with sub-minute precision can create a custom time zone with granularity down to nanoseconds. Which they'd have to do anyways for time zones like TAI which don't have constant offsets (thanks leap seconds!) so you can't use an offset time zone anyways. AFAICT, there has never been a real-world time zone that has had a non-minute-aligned offset whose offset has never changed.  So I'm kinda skeptical that "offset time zones at sub-minute precision" are real things.</p>
<p>P.S. - one concern raised was how RFC 5545 (aka iCalendar) supports <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.14">second-precision offsets</a>. But AFAICT, those offsets are never actually used for time zone identifiers. Rather, they're used to define the offsets of named time zones. And Temporal is already permissive with timestamp offset inputs, so we'll accept strings like <code>1970-01-01T00:00-00:44:30</code> which AFAICT is what RFC5545 needs.</p>
<p>Summary: restricting to minutes for built-in offset time zones seems like a safe initial bet that we can always extend later if needed.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my obscure TED talk.</p>

</ol>
<p>These two pieces are independent!

<p>V8 and JSC don't do this today because they rely on CLDR and ICU which never update renamed IDs.  But nothing stops ICU-using implementations from doing what Firefox does and overriding the ~20 zones in CLDR that use out-of-date names. If an ICU solution will take 2 years, could V8 and JSC in the meantime just add a hard-coded mapping table of 20 IDs?  It's not like renames happen often: less than once per year is the average.

<p>That said, it's a reasonable argument that doing (1) before (2), or at the same time, would reduce the negative impact to existing code because user-inputted zones wouldn't be affected.</p>
<p>My suggestion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's get implementations building &amp; shipping Temporal!  After this plenary's normative changes are merged within a week or two, AFAIK there are no other large changes on the horizon.</li>
<li>IMO, V8 and JSC should really consider the 20-item hard-coded mapping table to work around CLDR's slow schedule. Could this work be paired with Temporal implementation instead of waiting until later? Could this work start now, and ship in a limited test to gauge the web-compat impact?</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="nick-12">justingrant</span> I was wondering about how this rounding handled midpoint values like -00:44:30 or +00:44:30 (specifically "ties away from zero" vs. "ties toward positive infinity" vs. "ties toward even"), but I don't see <em>any</em> mention of it at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended-08.html">https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended-08.html</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-sedate/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended/blob/main/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended.md">https://github.com/ietf-wg-sedate/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended/blob/main/draft-ietf-sedate-datetime-extended.md</a> . Are you sure you're not thinking of <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/#sec-temporal-interpretisodatetimeoffset">Temporal InterpretISODateTimeOffset</a> step 8.c.i RoundNumberToIncrement(<em>candidateNanoseconds</em>, 60e9, "halfExpand")?</p>
</blockquote></mx-reply>Good catch. You're right, the rounding is a Temporal solution, not something in the IETF spec. Let's discuss among the Temporal champions whether it's wroth trying to get this into the IETF spec, or whether it's too niche for us to care about pushing it into that spec.</td></tr>
