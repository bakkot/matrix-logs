When I last left off, there wasn't much in the core language that would leverage it (basically only as an extra option to <code>then</code>, <code>catch</code>, <code>all</code>, or <code>race</code>), but now we have <code>import()</code>, <code>Atomics.waitAsync</code>, and a proposal for <code>Array.asyncFrom</code> so I'm starting to think there's enough value to be had by adopting the protocol approach. It doesn't introduce a new primitive to the language for cancellation, but would allow TC39 to spec something so that <code>AbortController</code>/<code>AbortSignal</code> could work with core language APIs, and give the community some room to experiment with other cancellation primitives. If anyone has thoughts or wants to contribute, please check <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-cancellation/issues/22">https://github.com/tc39/proposal-cancellation/issues/22</a> and I'll see if I can put something together within the next 1-2 meetings.</td></tr>

My current design is roughly based on the Observable proposal's subscriptions and revokable proxies (i.e., you get an object back that lets you call a method to signal disinterest). </td></tr>
