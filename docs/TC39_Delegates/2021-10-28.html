Proposal authors (especially if the proposal's polyfill gets a lot of use) have a lot of tribal knowledge about the requirements for error messages, but AFAIK there's not really an "official" way to convey that knowledge to implementers. Nor is there a requirement that proposal authors think through the "how are users likely to misuse this API and what should the error message say to help them?" problem.  I don't think that implementers should be required to use any particular error message, but IMO having more clarity and consistency in error messages across implementations seems like a good idea, both to help users and to avoid inevitable churn from bug reports asking to improve error messages after the implementation ships. Also, implementers may not have insight into the kinds of bugs that users will run into, so they may not be in the best position to write the most helpful error message text without getting those bug reports.</p>
<p>I'm not proposing any specific solution, but did want to highlight the problem and see if there was any existing prior art on the committee around this issue.</p>

But if you pass an options bag without a smallestUnit, then round should be the identity.</blockquote></mx-reply><p>We'll plan to spend our overflow time tomorrow focusing on this question. Reading the replies above, I believe that there are three possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>.round({})</code> is allowed (and does nothing), but <code>.round()</code> throws.</li>
<li>Both are accepted and do nothing.</li>
<li>Both throw.</li>
</ol>
<p>The current Temporal Stage 3 proposal uses (3). There were two reasons the champions selected (3): first, because it's a no-op and likely a programmer bug, and second for defense against typos in the property name like <code>.round({smalestUnit: 'second'})</code> which would be treated the same as <code>.round({})</code>.  (Sadly there's no typo defense for optional property names without breaking extensibility, but our opinion was that preventing at least some bugs was better than preventing no bugs.)</p>
<p>One request I'll relay from <span class="nick-13">ptomato</span>: this proposal is already in Stage 3, so we'd ask for there to be a really persuasive case to change the existing plan of record. The default should be that we stick with what's already been approved, because we really want to get this API shipped soon!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We also implemented the following process:</p>
<ul>
<li>PRs that affect the spec text are marked with a <code>spec-text</code> label in GH <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Aspec-text">https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Aspec-text</a></li>
<li>PRs that don't affect the spec (e.g. changes to docs, polyfill, tests, build tools hell, etc.) are marked <code>no-spec-text</code></li>
<li>PR authors who forget to put the right label on (prime suspect: me, usually!) will be publicly embarrassed and a maintainer will quickly add the right label.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll leave it to Frank and other implementers to say whether it's actually been helpful in cutting down the noise, but anecdotally I've been hearing fewer complaints since we started doing this so ðŸ¤·.</p>
