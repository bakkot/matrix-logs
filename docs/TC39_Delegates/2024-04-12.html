I haven't heard of a pub-sub thing with a requirement like that. Using the signals directly to represent themselves, as opposed to a subscription object, saves lots of allocations in a hot path. And there's no payload--also unusual for pub/sub systems (since you get the payload by reading the computed, and computeds are not pub/sub)</td></tr>

That said, I really liked your point (the "simple effects" people intuit they want are a DOM feature).</blockquote></mx-reply><p>Yes, I am sympathetic with this inevitability of direct use... I would like to improve the ergonomics as much as possible, as long as the proposal still works (e.g., not introducing too much runtime overhead).</p>
<p>The main thing that's relevant here is, you shouldn't use Watcher objects as if they represent a subscription to a Computed. You <em>can</em> sort of do this, but we  want to discourage that usage style--Computeds are supposed to exist within a lazily evaluated dependency graph.</p>
<p>Overusing Watchers moves you back towards push-based reactivity. It causes more "loops" until all the values "settle". It's like overusing <code>useEffect</code> in React.</p>
