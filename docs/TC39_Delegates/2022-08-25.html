<p>Is this becoming too burdensome?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not on the editors, but it's kind of an inherently burdensome request for contributors. It's several pages of legalese you're being asked to agree to, and also when I was a student if I were asked to sign an IPR I would probably have wanted to talk to the department lawyers to confirm that they weren't going to try to claim work I was doing, which they do sometimes do want to claim, before I was willing to represent that I did in fact have the rights to provide "all contributions I will make". (Probably talking to the lawyers would have been overkill, but I tended to be cautious about that sort of thing when I was in school.)</p>
<p>So I'd prefer avoiding making the request when it's not actually necessary.</p>
