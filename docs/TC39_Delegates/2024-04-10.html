I'm willing to consider alternatives that support the scenarios I've discussed. I'd entertain an opaque hash if it were feasible to actually support those scenarios in a performant way. A Composite key cannot satisfy those scenarios as it can never be fast in a custom collection, only in native Map/Set. Maybe I'd be less concerned if a <code>ConcurrentMap</code> were in the MVP for shared structs, but I know that shared structs <em>without</em> concurrent collections is already a hard sell. The problem is that shared structs <em>without</em> concurrent collections is nearly unusable for my use cases without the ability to implement a fast efficient custom collection. To support it in the dev trial I essentially had to tag every shared struct with a monotonically increasing identity to use as the hash, and implement a string hashing algorithm just so I could roll my own <code>ConcurrentMap</code>. That approach has a lot of overhead I'd rather avoid.</td></tr>

While also not precluding another proposal for exposing hashing function for the use cases when full control and minimal object allocations are desirable.
For use cases when R&amp;T can be adopted as the data model of the application, this would be efficient. Using these values as Map/Set keys would require not extra allocation (outside of the map/set's own storage naturally), and the hashing and equality functions would be 100% native with zero need for userland re-entrancy guards.
However Ron is correct that when R&amp;T need to be created as keys because the data model and the keys are not directly compatible then those application will need to allocate more objects to create the keys. This should be more memory efficient than the current solution of flattening values into one long string, but is still an extra allocation that a purely manual hashing+equality interface would avoid.</td></tr>

If I want to use a <code>Uri</code> or a <code>Point</code> or a <code>Location</code> as a key, I would have to convert it to a R&amp;T type or composite key first, which is an allocation for <em>every</em> call to <code>get</code>/<code>set</code>/<code>has</code>. This can be 1000s of allocations in a tight loop, and if I don't own <code>Uri</code> or <code>Point</code> or <code>Location</code> I can't just convert those to be R&amp;T types. An <code>{ equals, hash }</code> object is a single allocation that is reused for every key.<br>Another of my goals is maturing the language. Custom collection classes can't perform as well as native <code>Map</code>/<code>Set</code> because developers don't have access to the requisite core capabilities necessary to make that happen. I'm concerned that composite keys either become evolutionary dead end for the language if these building blocks become available, or they become a rationale to never make these building blocks available and thus we never have the flexibility to write efficient custom collections.</td></tr>

The argument's I've heard for only advancing deterministic APIs do not seem convincing to me. Non-determinism is good for security. Non-determinism is good for performance.

The only rationale I've heard is replay of execution, but there are other technologies for that and it depends on denial of <code>Math.random()</code> and <code><a href="http://Date.now">Date.now</a>()</code> (and <code><a href="http://Temporal.Now">Temporal.Now</a></code>, and numerous other sources of randomness). <code>Object.hash()</code> could just as easily be denied or made deterministic to serve that case.

You want structural comparisons for your collection entries, but these values are shared? How can a structural comparison be stable if the data itself can change from under you? Could part of the "solution" be to make R/T sharable and valid values inside shared structs?</p>
<p>IMO, the ability to shim new features is highly preferable, but it rarely needs to be efficient / performant, nor does it need to be ergonomic for the shim implementer. I'd rather have a cohesive language that doesn't expose sharp edges.</p>
