I'm willing to consider alternatives that support the scenarios I've discussed. I'd entertain an opaque hash if it were feasible to actually support those scenarios in a performant way. A Composite key cannot satisfy those scenarios as it can never be fast in a custom collection, only in native Map/Set. Maybe I'd be less concerned if a <code>ConcurrentMap</code> were in the MVP for shared structs, but I know that shared structs <em>without</em> concurrent collections is already a hard sell. The problem is that shared structs <em>without</em> concurrent collections is nearly unusable for my use cases without the ability to implement a fast efficient custom collection. To support it in the dev trial I essentially had to tag every shared struct with a monotonically increasing identity to use as the hash, and implement a string hashing algorithm just so I could roll my own <code>ConcurrentMap</code>. That approach has a lot of overhead I'd rather avoid.</td></tr>

While also not precluding another proposal for exposing hashing function for the use cases when full control and minimal object allocations are desirable.
For use cases when R&amp;T can be adopted as the data model of the application, this would be efficient. Using these values as Map/Set keys would require not extra allocation (outside of the map/set's own storage naturally), and the hashing and equality functions would be 100% native with zero need for userland re-entrancy guards.
However Ron is correct that when R&amp;T need to be created as keys because the data model and the keys are not directly compatible then those application will need to allocate more objects to create the keys. This should be more memory efficient than the current solution of flattening values into one long string, but is still an extra allocation that a purely manual hashing+equality interface would avoid.</td></tr>
