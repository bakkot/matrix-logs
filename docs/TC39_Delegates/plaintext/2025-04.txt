[22:35:29.0753] <jschoi>
linusg has kindly made a pull request to proposal-array-from-async (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-from-async/pull/48). It makes mostly editorial updates to the proposal spec to match ECMA-262 changes. There’s also a small proposal spec bugfix.

Way back in 2022, the proposal spec received pre-Stage-3 reviews from ljharb and nicolo-ribaudo. Should I ask them for repeated reviews before merging the pull request, or should I be okay with merging it unilaterally?

(I do plan on kickstarting the proposal back up soon, maybe all the way to Stage 4.)

[01:01:51.0633] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm happy to take another look next week

Is there a particular reason why withdrawn [proposal-operator-overloading](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-operator-overloading)’s repository hasn’t been archived? littledan withdrew it about a year ago, but various people have still been posting to it.

(It would also be good to link prominently to https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2023-11/november-28.md#withdrawing-operator-overloading from the explainer.)

[19:04:30.0305] <jschoi>
Ditto goes for [proposal-extended-numeric-literals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-extended-numeric-literals).

[19:04:46.0571] <jschoi>
* Ditto goes for [proposal-extended-numeric-literals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-extended-numeric-literals), though that’s been getting less community traffic.

[01:14:51.0828] <Ashley Claymore>
Good spot. A withdrawn proposal could be re-started. So I don't necessarily think they need to be archived, unless the champions wish to. But an updated README and a pinned issue makes a lot of sense 

[04:38:53.0781] <eemeli>
Renaming the repo with a `withdrawn-` or similar prefix would make the status a bit clearer.

[04:51:26.0966] <Jesse>
AFAIU the tc39 organization in GitHub can define a label (e.g., `withdrawn`) that can be used on repos within the organization

[06:00:49.0657] <ryzokuken>
Hi everyone! For folks interested in visiting us for the hybrid plenary in May, we're working on organizing a community event in collaboration with local communities along the same lines as the recent SeattleJS event you might remember from the last hybrid meeting in Seattle. I've posted a call for participation here: https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/556, which allows you to volunteer for a talk or a panel but we're also open to new ideas. Basically if you're up for it, let us know through the spreadsheet form or just informally since it'd help us plan.

[09:32:50.0576] <ljharb>
they should be, it just slipped through the cracks. repos can be unarchived if needed

[10:16:42.0912] <Chris de Almeida>
📢 REMINDER! 📢 The deadline for advancement for the April meeting is just ~20 hours from now!

[12:31:37.0029] <jschoi>
It’s been a long time for me, sorry—what’s the deadline for new agenda items that do not advance a proposal?

[12:32:39.0856] <ptomato>
before the draft schedule is published?

[12:46:29.0980] <Rob Palmer>
We still encourage early posting.

[13:11:09.0301] <Michael Ficarra>
we formally accept an agenda at the beginning of a meeting, but that hasn't stopped us from making updates during the meeting

[13:11:34.0104] <Michael Ficarra>
> 3. Adoption of the agenda

[13:22:33.0322] <shu>
do we really

[13:22:44.0802] <shu>
like does someone say "are there any objections to adopting this agenda"

[13:38:27.0895] <bakkot>
at literally every meeting, yes

[13:39:49.0987] <shu>
i evict memories of the start of tc39 meetings almost immediately after they occur

[14:06:13.0272] <bakkot>
that's what the notes are for https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2024-12/december-02.md#:~:text=.%20Are%20there%20any%20objections%20against%20proceeding%20with%20the%20current%20agenda%3F%20None%3F%20Okay.%20We%20have%20adopted%20the%20agenda.

[14:08:16.0480] <shu>
look, i'm not even in the list of attendees, it checks out

[15:43:57.0227] <Michael Ficarra>
there's a lot of things on the agenda for stage advancement with no links

[15:44:51.0468] <Michael Ficarra>
reminder @mhofman:matrix.org @erights:matrix.org that links to review materials should be provided before the advancement deadline

[15:46:03.0656] <kriskowal>
Mark’s been working to produce material all week. I’ll pass on the reminder, and you can expect links soon.

[06:32:48.0093] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Could we give back to delegates permission to merge in the agenda repo, at least when CI on a PR is green?

[06:34:04.0607] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I understand that ljharb would like to merge the PRs to make sure they conform to the nice commit format (i.e. `YYYY.MM: description`, single commit, squash locally and then merge withuot squashing), but:
- many delegates are trying to respect this format by ourselves too
- many delegates don't care about it and have write access anyway

[06:34:14.0413] <nicolo-ribaudo>

[06:50:58.0363] <nicolo-ribaudo>
(sorry Jordan for putting you on the spot if the reason I lost merge access is not this one 😅)

[07:01:46.0384] <Chris de Almeida>
nicolo-ribaudo: delegates have write access

[07:02:12.0963] <Chris de Almeida>
this hasn't changed.. not sure what issue you are running into

[07:02:28.0307] <littledan>
I do not have write access

[07:02:57.0341] <Chris de Almeida>
do you have a couple minutes to hop on a call to investigate?

[07:03:46.0113] <littledan>
sure

[07:14:08.0828] <ljharb>
? you should have that permission already on the agenda repo, yes

[07:14:22.0295] <ljharb>
PRs aren’t even a requirement

[07:14:25.0174] <Chris de Almeida>
I fixed it

[07:18:32.0375] <Chris de Almeida>
nicolo-ribaudo: fixed

[07:20:08.0098] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ok thank you :)

[07:21:48.0960] <ljharb>
(also merely having an open PR means you hit the deadline, so this sort of thing wouldn't impact that, at least)

[07:23:39.0447] <Chris de Almeida>
gentle reminder that even though PRs are not required, they are greatly appreciated because people who have notifications on will know there is something new on the agenda

[Math.sqrt](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/numbers-and-dates.html#sec-math.sqrt) says, “Return 𝔽(the square root of ℝ(n)),” but [Math.cbrt](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/numbers-and-dates.html#sec-math.cbrt) says, “Return an implementation-approximated Number value representing the cube root of ℝ(n).” Does anyone know why their language is different?

[19:53:35.0440] <bakkot>
jschoi: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3345

[19:53:58.0625] <bakkot>
basically we know that everyone is using a correct sqrt because wasm requires it but we don't know this about cube root and it's a pain to find out

[19:56:22.0949] <jschoi>
Ah…so it’s because there’s no cbrt instruction.

[19:57:23.0068] <jschoi>
* Ah…so it’s because there’s no cbrt instruction in WASM. A shame.

[20:01:55.0607] <jschoi>
* Ah…so it’s because there’s no cbrt instruction in WASM. That seems like an unfortunate omission.

[20:01:58.0037] <jschoi>
I presume that BigInt.sqrt should also use the “implementation-approximated” language, since it’s not trying to match a f32/364 WASM instruction.

[20:02:17.0691] <jschoi>
* I presume that BigInt.sqrt should also use the “implementation-approximated” language, since it’s not trying to match a f32/364 WASM instruction but rather something like [Waldemar’s novel implementation](https://github.com/waldemarhorwat/integer-roots).

[20:04:00.0309] <jschoi>
* I presume that BigInt.sqrt should also use the “implementation-approximated” language, since it’s not trying to match a f32/364 WASM instruction but rather something like [Waldemar’s novel implementation](https://github.com/waldemarhorwat/integer-roots) over an unbounded ℕ domain.

[20:31:37.0198] <bakkot>
no, if it's straightforward for everyone to have the right answer, then we should require the right answer

[20:31:46.0130] <bakkot>
and waldemar's is exact

[20:32:08.0099] <bakkot>
we only do implementation-approximated if getting the exact right answer is difficult or expensive

[20:38:34.0408] <jschoi>
Oh, so then *both* BigInt.sqrt and BigInt.cbrt should say, “Return ℤ(the square/cube root of ℝ(n))”.

[20:39:10.0319] <jschoi>
* Oh, so then _both_ BigInt.sqrt and BigInt.cbrt should say something like, “Return ℤ(the square/cube root of ℝ(n)), truncated toward 0”.

[20:39:12.0272] <jschoi>
* Oh, so then _both_ BigInt.sqrt and BigInt.cbrt should say something like, “Return ℤ(the square/cube root of ℝ(n)), truncated toward 0.”

[20:45:13.0979] <bakkot>
yes although the ℤ operator takes an integer as input so it would have to be more like “Return ℤ(the square/cube root of ℝ(n) truncated toward 0)”

[20:45:19.0534] <bakkot>
though probably clearer as two steps

[20:48:11.0593] <jschoi>
Editorially, would
“Let _root_ be the integer part of the square/cube root of ℝ(n)” or
“Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(n), truncated toward 0”
be preferable?

[20:48:22.0243] <jschoi>
* Editorially, would
“Let _root_ be the integer part of the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_)” or
“Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_), truncated toward 0”
be preferable?

[20:49:47.0006] <jschoi>
* Editorially, do you have an opinion about whether
“Let _root_ be the integer part of the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_); return ℤ(_root_)”,
“Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_), truncated toward 0; return ℤ(_root_)”,
“Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_); return ℤ(the integer part of _root_)”, or
“Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_); return ℤ(_root_ truncated toward 0)”
be preferable?

[20:50:40.0154] <jschoi>
* Editorially, do you have an opinion about which would be preferable?
1. Let _root_ be the integer part of the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_). Return ℤ(_root_).
2. Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_), truncated toward 0. Return ℤ(_root_).
3. Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_). Return ℤ(the integer part of _root_).
4. Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_). Return ℤ(_root_ truncated toward 0).

[20:58:04.0786] <jschoi>
* Editorially, do you have an opinion about which would be preferable?

1. Let _root_ be the integer part of the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_). Return ℤ(_root_).
2. Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_), truncated toward 0. Return ℤ(_root_).
3. Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_). Return ℤ(the integer part of _root_).
4. Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_). Return ℤ(_root_ truncated toward 0).

Hm, I see MakeFullYear does already use “the integer part of”. There is nowhere in the spec that uses “toward 0/+∞/-∞”.

Do we have an in-person sign-up form or location information for the May (Igalia/A Coruña) meeting yet? I would like to book travel soon to avoid higher fares. /cc @usharma:igalia.com

[09:40:12.0898] <ryzokuken>
We do, let me publish something on the reflector soon.

[09:40:26.0520] <ryzokuken>
* We do but it was a bit WIP around some details, let me publish something on the reflector soon.

[09:43:35.0504] <Michael Ficarra>
The things I need most urgently are just the address of the meeting and some hotel recommendations.

[10:53:08.0629] <Richard Gibson>
We don't have "toward 0/+∞/-∞", but we do have [truncate](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/notational-conventions.html#eqn-truncate), which I would prefer:
1. Let _root_ be the square/cube root of ℝ(_n_).
2. Return ℤ(truncate(_root_)).

[14:04:45.0658] <jschoi>
Richard Gibson: Thanks for pointing out that there is a truncate; I don’t know how I missed that. 
Two other people marked that they wanted “Let root be the integer part of the square/cube root of ℝ(n). Return ℤ(root),” but your suggestion seems cleaner to me.
