the ES2025 candidate has been prepared:

linusg has kindly made a pull request to proposal-array-from-async (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-from-async/pull/48). It makes mostly editorial updates to the proposal spec to match ECMA-262 changes. Thereâ€™s also a small proposal spec bugfix.

Way back in 2022, the proposal spec received pre-Stage-3 reviews from ljharb and nicolo-ribaudo. Should I ask them for repeated reviews before merging the pull request, or should I be okay with merging it unilaterally?

(I do plan on kickstarting the proposal back up soon, maybe all the way to StageÂ 4.)

[01:01:51.0633] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm happy to take another look next week

Is there a particular reason why withdrawn [proposal-operator-overloading](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-operator-overloading)â€™s repository hasnâ€™t been archived? littledan withdrew it about a year ago, but various people have still been posting to it.

(It would also be good to link prominently to https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2023-11/november-28.md#withdrawing-operator-overloading from the explainer.)

Ditto goes for [proposal-extended-numeric-literals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-extended-numeric-literals).

Good spot. A withdrawn proposal could be re-started. So I don't necessarily think they need to be archived, unless the champions wish to. But an updated README and a pinned issue makes a lot of sense 

[04:38:53.0781] <eemeli>
Renaming the repo with a `withdrawn-` or similar prefix would make the status a bit clearer.

[04:51:26.0966] <Jesse>
AFAIU the tc39 organization in GitHub can define a label (e.g., `withdrawn`) that can be used on repos within the organization

Hi everyone! For folks interested in visiting us for the hybrid plenary in May, we're working on organizing a community event in collaboration with local communities along the same lines as the recent SeattleJS event you might remember from the last hybrid meeting in Seattle. I've posted a call for participation here: https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/556, which allows you to volunteer for a talk or a panel but we're also open to new ideas. Basically if you're up for it, let us know through the spreadsheet form or just informally since it'd help us plan.

[09:32:50.0576] <ljharb>
they should be, it just slipped through the cracks. repos can be unarchived if needed

ðŸ“¢ REMINDER! ðŸ“¢ The deadline for advancement for the April meeting is just ~20 hours from now!

[12:31:37.0029] <jschoi>
Itâ€™s been a long time for me, sorryâ€”whatâ€™s the deadline for new agenda items that do not advance a proposal?

[12:32:39.0856] <ptomato>
before the draft schedule is published?

[12:46:29.0980] <Rob Palmer>
We still encourage early posting.

[13:11:09.0301] <Michael Ficarra>
we formally accept an agenda at the beginning of a meeting, but that hasn't stopped us from making updates during the meeting

[13:11:34.0104] <Michael Ficarra>
> 3. Adoption of the agenda

[13:22:33.0322] <shu>
do we really

[13:22:44.0802] <shu>
like does someone say "are there any objections to adopting this agenda"

[13:38:27.0895] <bakkot>
at literally every meeting, yes

[13:39:49.0987] <shu>
i evict memories of the start of tc39 meetings almost immediately after they occur

[14:06:13.0272] <bakkot>
that's what the notes are for https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2024-12/december-02.md#:~:text=.%20Are%20there%20any%20objections%20against%20proceeding%20with%20the%20current%20agenda%3F%20None%3F%20Okay.%20We%20have%20adopted%20the%20agenda.

[14:08:16.0480] <shu>
look, i'm not even in the list of attendees, it checks out
