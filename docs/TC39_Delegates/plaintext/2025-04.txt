linusg has kindly made a pull request to proposal-array-from-async (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-from-async/pull/48). It makes mostly editorial updates to the proposal spec to match ECMA-262 changes. There’s also a small proposal spec bugfix.

Way back in 2022, the proposal spec received pre-Stage-3 reviews from ljharb and nicolo-ribaudo. Should I ask them for repeated reviews before merging the pull request, or should I be okay with merging it unilaterally?

(I do plan on kickstarting the proposal back up soon, maybe all the way to Stage 4.)
