linusg has kindly made a pull request to proposal-array-from-async (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-from-async/pull/48). It makes mostly editorial updates to the proposal spec to match ECMA-262 changes. There’s also a small proposal spec bugfix.

Way back in 2022, the proposal spec received pre-Stage-3 reviews from ljharb and nicolo-ribaudo. Should I ask them for repeated reviews before merging the pull request, or should I be okay with merging it unilaterally?

(I do plan on kickstarting the proposal back up soon, maybe all the way to Stage 4.)

I'm happy to take another look next week

Is there a particular reason why withdrawn [proposal-operator-overloading](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-operator-overloading)’s repository hasn’t been archived? littledan withdrew it about a year ago, but various people have still been posting to it.

(It would also be good to link prominently to https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2023-11/november-28.md#withdrawing-operator-overloading from the explainer.)

Ditto goes for [proposal-extended-numeric-literals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-extended-numeric-literals).

Good spot. A withdrawn proposal could be re-started. So I don't necessarily think they need to be archived, unless the champions wish to. But an updated README and a pinned issue makes a lot of sense
