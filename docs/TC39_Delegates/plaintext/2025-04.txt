the ES2025 candidate has been prepared:

linusg has kindly made a pull request to proposal-array-from-async (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-from-async/pull/48). It makes mostly editorial updates to the proposal spec to match ECMA-262 changes. There’s also a small proposal spec bugfix.

Way back in 2022, the proposal spec received pre-Stage-3 reviews from ljharb and nicolo-ribaudo. Should I ask them for repeated reviews before merging the pull request, or should I be okay with merging it unilaterally?

(I do plan on kickstarting the proposal back up soon, maybe all the way to Stage 4.)

[01:01:51.0633] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm happy to take another look next week

Is there a particular reason why withdrawn [proposal-operator-overloading](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-operator-overloading)’s repository hasn’t been archived? littledan withdrew it about a year ago, but various people have still been posting to it.

(It would also be good to link prominently to https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2023-11/november-28.md#withdrawing-operator-overloading from the explainer.)

Ditto goes for [proposal-extended-numeric-literals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-extended-numeric-literals).

* Ditto goes for [proposal-extended-numeric-literals](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-extended-numeric-literals), though that’s been getting less community traffic.

[01:14:51.0828] <Ashley Claymore>
Good spot. A withdrawn proposal could be re-started. So I don't necessarily think they need to be archived, unless the champions wish to. But an updated README and a pinned issue makes a lot of sense 

[04:38:53.0781] <eemeli>
Renaming the repo with a `withdrawn-` or similar prefix would make the status a bit clearer.

[04:51:26.0966] <Jesse>
AFAIU the tc39 organization in GitHub can define a label (e.g., `withdrawn`) that can be used on repos within the organization

Hi everyone! For folks interested in visiting us for the hybrid plenary in May, we're working on organizing a community event in collaboration with local communities along the same lines as the recent SeattleJS event you might remember from the last hybrid meeting in Seattle. I've posted a call for participation here: https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/556, which allows you to volunteer for a talk or a panel but we're also open to new ideas. Basically if you're up for it, let us know through the spreadsheet form or just informally since it'd help us plan.

[09:32:50.0576] <ljharb>
they should be, it just slipped through the cracks. repos can be unarchived if needed

📢 REMINDER! 📢 The deadline for advancement for the April meeting is just ~20 hours from now!

[12:31:37.0029] <jschoi>
It’s been a long time for me, sorry—what’s the deadline for new agenda items that do not advance a proposal?

[12:32:39.0856] <ptomato>
before the draft schedule is published?

[12:46:29.0980] <Rob Palmer>
We still encourage early posting.

[13:11:09.0301] <Michael Ficarra>
we formally accept an agenda at the beginning of a meeting, but that hasn't stopped us from making updates during the meeting

[13:11:34.0104] <Michael Ficarra>
> 3. Adoption of the agenda

[13:22:33.0322] <shu>
do we really

[13:22:44.0802] <shu>
like does someone say "are there any objections to adopting this agenda"

[13:38:27.0895] <bakkot>
at literally every meeting, yes

[13:39:49.0987] <shu>
i evict memories of the start of tc39 meetings almost immediately after they occur

[14:06:13.0272] <bakkot>
that's what the notes are for https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2024-12/december-02.md#:~:text=.%20Are%20there%20any%20objections%20against%20proceeding%20with%20the%20current%20agenda%3F%20None%3F%20Okay.%20We%20have%20adopted%20the%20agenda.

[14:08:16.0480] <shu>
look, i'm not even in the list of attendees, it checks out

[15:43:57.0227] <Michael Ficarra>
there's a lot of things on the agenda for stage advancement with no links

[15:44:51.0468] <Michael Ficarra>
reminder @mhofman:matrix.org @erights:matrix.org that links to review materials should be provided before the advancement deadline

[15:46:03.0656] <kriskowal>
Mark’s been working to produce material all week. I’ll pass on the reminder, and you can expect links soon.

Could we give back to delegates permission to merge in the agenda repo, at least when CI on a PR is green?

[06:34:04.0607] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I understand that ljharb would like to merge the PRs to make sure they conform to the nice commit format (i.e. `YYYY.MM: description`, single commit, squash locally and then merge withuot squashing), but:
- many delegates are trying to respect this format by ourselves too
- many delegates don't care about it and have write access anyway

[06:50:58.0363] <nicolo-ribaudo>
(sorry Jordan for putting you on the spot if the reason I lost merge access is not this one 😅)

[07:01:46.0384] <Chris de Almeida>
nicolo-ribaudo: delegates have write access

[07:02:12.0963] <Chris de Almeida>
this hasn't changed.. not sure what issue you are running into

[07:02:28.0307] <littledan>
I do not have write access

[07:02:57.0341] <Chris de Almeida>
do you have a couple minutes to hop on a call to investigate?

[07:03:46.0113] <littledan>
sure

[07:14:08.0828] <ljharb>
? you should have that permission already on the agenda repo, yes

[07:14:22.0295] <ljharb>
PRs aren’t even a requirement

[07:14:25.0174] <Chris de Almeida>
I fixed it

[07:18:32.0375] <Chris de Almeida>
nicolo-ribaudo: fixed

[07:20:08.0098] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ok thank you :)

[07:21:48.0960] <ljharb>
(also merely having an open PR means you hit the deadline, so this sort of thing wouldn't impact that, at least)

[07:23:39.0447] <Chris de Almeida>
gentle reminder that even though PRs are not required, they are greatly appreciated because people who have notifications on will know there is something new on the agenda
