ah

[19:01:01.0146] <Jack Works>
when can we have field declaration in constructor parameter

[19:01:51.0206] <Jack Works>
```js
constructor(#srv) {}
```

rather than

```js
#srv
constructor(srv) {
    this.#srv = srv
}
```

[20:02:28.0439] <ljharb>
what about if you want `this.srv = srv;`?

[21:08:27.0330] <Jack Works>
I don't know ü§£

[07:13:04.0786] <bakkot>
some discussion around `take` being confusing in this thread, with a proposed fix of renaming to `limit`; thoughts? https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/issues/71#issuecomment-1461841551

[07:13:46.0856] <bakkot>
specifically the confusion is, the subiterator form `take` closes the underlying thing when the subiterator is exhausted, which might confuse people who are wanting to repeatedly take a few items

[07:14:34.0173] <bakkot>
this is a disanalogy with other languages because most things you can call `take` on don't have a notion of "being closed", even iterators

ljharb: we have some extra time on the agenda this meeting; if markm's around, do you think we could talk about next steps for making regex escape happen?

[01:07:49.0063] <bakkot>
that is, assuming the next step for that proposal is "talk to the rest of the committee and settle on a design", rather than anything in particular which would need to be done in advance of the meeting

[01:19:48.0498] <bakkot>
(or if anyone has other proposals blocked on similar "we just need to discuss and/or argue about it for a while" issues, this seems like a good time)

Could be fun also to chat about the fundamentals of equality and immutability and what the committee wants there.

[04:43:07.0101] <littledan>
Also, if we are going totally crazy, we could talk about reactivity and signals and observables

I'm happy to chat about decimal numbers!

hopefully not ‚ÑÇ

[15:03:17.0694] <ljharb>
went ahead and added a topic for it

Next up, quaternions

[01:51:12.0995] <Jesse>
see, there's all sorts of stuff to talk about!

[09:26:19.0632] <Michael Ficarra>
okay, serious question: what advantage do decimals have over rationals?

[09:26:24.0956] <Michael Ficarra>
it seems like rationals would be strictly better

[09:27:20.0136] <Michael Ficarra>
and a rational library is really simple to implement on top of bigints today

[09:36:00.0613] <Jesse>
one concern that comes to mind with rationals would be the normal form representation (unless one wants to expose numerically equal values with different representations). There might be quite a lot of integer division and modulo checks to reduce the numerators and denominators

[09:38:02.0944] <Jesse>
there was a discussion about rationals in proposal-decimal: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/6

[09:45:27.0832] <littledan>
Rationals and decimals are just different data types. A very common and important operation on decimals is rounding in an inherently base-10 way; this operation doesn't really make sense on rationals.

[09:46:03.0526] <littledan>
pervasive rounding is also important to control size blowup (which, as Waldemar, remains a problem anyway for BigDecimal, but is worse for rationals)

[09:55:21.0264] <Michael Ficarra>
I dunno, that thread seems to support rational pretty well IMO

[09:55:51.0000] <Michael Ficarra>
a smart implementation can amortise the GCDs as appropriate for the platform

[09:56:49.0713] <Michael Ficarra>
anyway, we can talk more about it at the meeting next week

[12:15:53.0207] <littledan>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> I dunno, that thread seems to support rational pretty well IMO

Heh my leading comment there is pretty weak. I'd say that the main factor for me is this round operation. Looking forward to discussing more.

Reminder for anyone attending the meeting next week: prepare for rain. March is Seattle's rainiest month. It will rain every day.

[12:39:42.0961] <littledan>
ljharb: Just curious, was the ordering there deliberate?

[12:41:17.0821] <ljharb>
 ordering?

[12:59:44.0974] <Ashley Claymore>
Extra please I choose the nearest hotel 

[12:59:50.0213] <Ashley Claymore>
* Extra pleased I choose the nearest hotel

[13:04:03.0989] <Michael Ficarra>
yes, the Lotte literally has a covered walkway between its entrance and the F5 Tower entrance

[13:41:49.0134] <littledan>
the RegExp topic comes amid Stage 3 proposals, even though it's Stage 1

[13:41:56.0048] <littledan>
in the agenda

[14:15:35.0948] <ljharb>
sorting is by timebox first, then stage

[14:15:50.0170] <ljharb>
or did i mess that up, and it‚Äôs the reverse? I‚Äôll check 

[14:16:07.0950] <ljharb>
ah you‚Äôre right, my bad, will fix

[14:33:06.0955] <Michael Ficarra>
no need, I fixed it for you already

[14:36:12.0639] <ljharb>
i saw; there were a few others that needed fixing so i rebased and pushed

[15:25:10.0928] <ptomato>
anyone got any recommendations for where to buy a prepaid SIM card nearby the venue?

[15:33:11.0833] <Michael Ficarra>
ptomato: Will you be arriving via the airport? Usually there are kiosks in the airport.

[15:35:01.0903] <ptomato>
I'm coming by train from north of the border üòÑ

[15:37:42.0944] <Michael Ficarra>
Does your carrier not cover US/Canada? Most US carriers cover Canada at least.

[15:39:45.0772] <ptomato>
I have a very cheap carrier which does not cover the US  - I rarely use talk/text unless I'm travelling, in which case I buy a SIM card

[15:45:52.0233] <Michael Ficarra>
I would probably try this 7-Eleven around the corner: https://goo.gl/maps/Qg11dSu9Fcz2LmRy8

[15:46:24.0313] <ptomato>
thanks!

[15:46:28.0818] <Michael Ficarra>
also if you're picking up masks/tests at the local Bartell Drugs, they may carry prepaid SIM cards

[15:47:02.0001] <ptomato>
those I was going to bring, but that's nonetheless a good tip for others maybe!

[15:48:51.0675] <Michael Ficarra>
it also might not be too late to order a prepaid US SIM online and get it delivered before you leave

[15:49:22.0904] <Michael Ficarra>
that might be better if you're worried about being without talk/text/data on your way from the train to F5 Tower

[15:51:20.0763] <Michael Ficarra>
anyway, if none of those suggestions work, just ping one of us and we can help figure something out

[15:52:09.0715] <ptomato>
I'm not too worried about that, I'd probably be using it more for coordination with other attendees

[15:52:12.0270] <ptomato>
thanks!

 * ptomato: if your phone has eSIM, I've used the ones you can buy online, and worked well

[17:36:40.0344] <Chris de Almeida>
well - I only used the data-only one that Orange sells and used in Europe, but presumably can get the same for US from them or another carrier

[17:38:45.0960] <Chris de Almeida>
I avoided the resellers like airalo, etc that route all your stuff through middleperson servers

Hello all.  Plenary meeting begins in just under two hours.

For those attending in person in Seattle, please arrive from 09:20 where you will be met in the F5 lobby.  Breakfast will be served on the same floor as the meeting room from 09:30.
