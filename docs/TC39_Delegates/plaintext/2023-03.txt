ah

[19:01:01.0146] <Jack Works>
when can we have field declaration in constructor parameter

[19:01:51.0206] <Jack Works>
```js
constructor(#srv) {}
```

rather than

```js
#srv
constructor(srv) {
    this.#srv = srv
}
```

[20:02:28.0439] <ljharb>
what about if you want `this.srv = srv;`?

I don't know ðŸ¤£

some discussion around `take` being confusing in this thread, with a proposed fix of renaming to `limit`; thoughts? https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/issues/71#issuecomment-1461841551

[07:13:46.0856] <bakkot>
specifically the confusion is, the subiterator form `take` closes the underlying thing when the subiterator is exhausted, which might confuse people who are wanting to repeatedly take a few items

[07:14:34.0173] <bakkot>
this is a disanalogy with other languages because most things you can call `take` on don't have a notion of "being closed", even iterators

ljharb: we have some extra time on the agenda this meeting; if markm's around, do you think we could talk about next steps for making regex escape happen?

[01:07:49.0063] <bakkot>
that is, assuming the next step for that proposal is "talk to the rest of the committee and settle on a design", rather than anything in particular which would need to be done in advance of the meeting
