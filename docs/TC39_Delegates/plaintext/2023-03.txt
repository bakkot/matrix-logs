ah

[19:01:01.0146] <Jack Works>
when can we have field declaration in constructor parameter

[19:01:51.0206] <Jack Works>
```js
constructor(#srv) {}
```

rather than

```js
#srv
constructor(srv) {
    this.#srv = srv
}
```

[20:02:28.0439] <ljharb>
what about if you want `this.srv = srv;`?

[21:08:27.0330] <Jack Works>
I don't know 🤣

[07:13:04.0786] <bakkot>
some discussion around `take` being confusing in this thread, with a proposed fix of renaming to `limit`; thoughts? https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/issues/71#issuecomment-1461841551

[07:13:46.0856] <bakkot>
specifically the confusion is, the subiterator form `take` closes the underlying thing when the subiterator is exhausted, which might confuse people who are wanting to repeatedly take a few items

[07:14:34.0173] <bakkot>
this is a disanalogy with other languages because most things you can call `take` on don't have a notion of "being closed", even iterators

ljharb: we have some extra time on the agenda this meeting; if markm's around, do you think we could talk about next steps for making regex escape happen?

[01:07:49.0063] <bakkot>
that is, assuming the next step for that proposal is "talk to the rest of the committee and settle on a design", rather than anything in particular which would need to be done in advance of the meeting

[01:19:48.0498] <bakkot>
(or if anyone has other proposals blocked on similar "we just need to discuss and/or argue about it for a while" issues, this seems like a good time)

Could be fun also to chat about the fundamentals of equality and immutability and what the committee wants there.

[04:43:07.0101] <littledan>
Also, if we are going totally crazy, we could talk about reactivity and signals and observables

see, there's all sorts of stuff to talk about!

[09:26:19.0632] <Michael Ficarra>
okay, serious question: what advantage do decimals have over rationals?

[09:26:24.0956] <Michael Ficarra>
it seems like rationals would be strictly better

[09:27:20.0136] <Michael Ficarra>
and a rational library is really simple to implement on top of bigints today

[09:36:00.0613] <Jesse>
one concern that comes to mind with rationals would be the normal form representation (unless one wants to expose numerically equal values with different representations). There might be quite a lot of integer division and modulo checks to reduce the numerators and denominators

[09:38:02.0944] <Jesse>
there was a discussion about rationals in proposal-decimal: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/6

[09:45:27.0832] <littledan>
Rationals and decimals are just different data types. A very common and important operation on decimals is rounding in an inherently base-10 way; this operation doesn't really make sense on rationals.

[09:46:03.0526] <littledan>
pervasive rounding is also important to control size blowup (which, as Waldemar, remains a problem anyway for BigDecimal, but is worse for rationals)

[09:55:21.0264] <Michael Ficarra>
I dunno, that thread seems to support rational pretty well IMO

[09:55:51.0000] <Michael Ficarra>
a smart implementation can amortise the GCDs as appropriate for the platform

[09:56:49.0713] <Michael Ficarra>
anyway, we can talk more about it at the meeting next week

[12:15:53.0207] <littledan>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> I dunno, that thread seems to support rational pretty well IMO

Heh my leading comment there is pretty weak. I'd say that the main factor for me is this round operation. Looking forward to discussing more.

anyone got any recommendations for where to buy a prepaid SIM card nearby the venue?

[15:33:11.0833] <Michael Ficarra>
ptomato: Will you be arriving via the airport? Usually there are kiosks in the airport.

[15:35:01.0903] <ptomato>
I'm coming by train from north of the border 😄

[15:37:42.0944] <Michael Ficarra>
Does your carrier not cover US/Canada? Most US carriers cover Canada at least.

[15:39:45.0772] <ptomato>
I have a very cheap carrier which does not cover the US  - I rarely use talk/text unless I'm travelling, in which case I buy a SIM card

[15:45:52.0233] <Michael Ficarra>
I would probably try this 7-Eleven around the corner: https://goo.gl/maps/Qg11dSu9Fcz2LmRy8

[15:46:24.0313] <ptomato>
thanks!

[15:46:28.0818] <Michael Ficarra>
also if you're picking up masks/tests at the local Bartell Drugs, they may carry prepaid SIM cards

[15:47:02.0001] <ptomato>
those I was going to bring, but that's nonetheless a good tip for others maybe!

[15:48:51.0675] <Michael Ficarra>
it also might not be too late to order a prepaid US SIM online and get it delivered before you leave

[15:49:22.0904] <Michael Ficarra>
that might be better if you're worried about being without talk/text/data on your way from the train to F5 Tower

[15:51:20.0763] <Michael Ficarra>
anyway, if none of those suggestions work, just ping one of us and we can help figure something out

[15:52:09.0715] <ptomato>
I'm not too worried about that, I'd probably be using it more for coordination with other attendees

TG2 is run very differently

[11:10:03.0712] <ryzokuken>
for one, the agenda isn't set up clearly ahead of time

[11:10:40.0706] <ryzokuken>
we don't use TCQ but do use a simpler Google Meet queue

[11:10:42.0196] <shu>
ah i misunderstood then, it was about how TG2 is run, not mozilla?

[11:11:07.0994] <ryzokuken>
well, a bit of both I thought

[11:11:32.0299] <ryzokuken>
because of how TG2 is run, Mozilla cannot have structured internal discussions about the agenda a week ahead

[11:11:42.0907] <ryzokuken>
(IIUC, dminor will probably correct me)

[11:11:43.0303] <dminor>
Basically, it would be difficult for us to review proposals properly in advance given the way that TG2 is currently run, so we'd prefer to continue to do advancement in the main committee meetings

Do any other Ecma TCs have shared costs between member companies that attend? Curious if something like specific TC "dues" could work if rolled up into the yearly fee.

[11:32:20.0825] <apaprocki>
A lot of pain in companies contracting out work if they can't do it themselves is the burden of that internal process... 

[11:35:36.0486] <ljharb>
it definitely seems like the primary purpose of member dues is so Ecma, not individual members, can fund shared needs.

[11:59:02.0634] <HE Shi-Jun>
not sure how renaming to limit/skip solve the problem ...

[12:00:10.0701] <Bradford Smith>
do all of the iterator helpers currently close the underlying iterator?

[12:00:36.0477] <rbuckton>
> <@haxjs:matrix.org> not sure how renaming to limit/skip solve the problem ...

I don't think it does, especially given the rather common meaning of `take` across the ecosystem as well as other languages.

[12:01:13.0781] <littledan>
> <@apaprocki:matrix.org> Do any other Ecma TCs have shared costs between member companies that attend? Curious if something like specific TC "dues" could work if rolled up into the yearly fee.

Ecma folks have told me that there have been shared costs historically, and that members handle their own financial things when it comes up

[12:01:15.0674] <rbuckton>
It's rather trivial to write a wrapper for an iterator that doesn't forward `return`

[12:01:21.0874] <littledan>
(and they consider this best practice in general)

[12:01:35.0695] <Rob Palmer>
We will return in one hour.  If any of the remote attendees have feedback on AV etc please say it here.

[12:01:57.0028] <Bradford Smith>
I find "limit" less understandable than "take". If it helps avoid misunderstanding, I would expect that's only because one has to read the docs to understand what it does at all.

[12:10:06.0956] <peetk>
imo "limit" conveys very clearly that the iterator is closed, i guess because it sounds like SQL limit, and obviously SQL queries are not stateful; whereas "take" is much more ambiguous. but i guess this is a minority view!

[12:56:40.0878] <Bradford Smith>
Are there actually any iterator helpers in the proposal that do *not* close the underlying iterator?

[12:58:20.0647] <Justin Ridgewell>
They all either iterate everything (thus closing the underlying), or close when they early exit

[12:58:26.0161] <bakkot>
`take` is special in that `take` ends _before_ exhausting the underlying iterator

[12:58:33.0685] <Bradford Smith>
My general expectation is that if I pass an iterator off to any other code, I should assume it is exhausted and not touch it again myself.

[12:59:20.0898] <bakkot>
whereas if you `map` or something the expectation is that it either you are exhausting it, which will naturally close the underlying iterator, or closing the `map` helper explicitly

[13:00:03.0787] <Justin Ridgewell>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> `take` is special in that `take` ends _before_ exhausting the underlying iterator

So does `some`, `every`, and `find`

[13:00:33.0166] <bakkot>
Justin Ridgewell: those don't produce new iterators though

[13:00:37.0297] <rbuckton>
Caveat being that `some`, `every`, and `find` return scalar results

[13:00:42.0904] <bakkot>
they are as it were "consumers" rather than "transfomers"

[13:01:58.0247] <rbuckton>
Though `take` ending before exhausting the iterator is a misconception. The fact it calls `return` is more of an optimization than a meaningful difference when it comes to sequence operators.

[13:02:56.0562] <bakkot>
by "an optimization", do you mean relative to the option of manually exhausting the underlying by calling `.next` repeatedly, or something else?

[13:03:09.0091] <rbuckton>
Yes.

[13:03:41.0995] <rbuckton>
If JS had no `.return` and the only way to close an iterator were to exhaust it, I would expect `take` to exhaust the iterator.

[13:04:14.0735] <rbuckton>
So its good that `return` exists, as it allows us to short-circuit such an expensive operation.

[13:05:10.0505] <rbuckton>
But I'm pretty sure that in every example of prior art in the ecosystem, where `take` is used it means "take X items and exhaust/close the underlying iterator"

[13:05:35.0432] <rbuckton>
If the iterator were a database, I would expect `take` to close the connection when completed. 

[13:05:42.0070] <rbuckton>
 * If the iterator were backed by a database, I would expect `take` to close the connection when completed.

[13:05:55.0389] <rbuckton>
The alternative is resource starvation, which is a bad failure state.

[13:06:41.0972] <rbuckton>
If you want "consume X and not close", that operation is normally named something like `read` (at least, where IO is concerned)

[13:10:50.0479] <ljharb>
erights: i finished the iterator helpers "close the underlying iterator" change before lunch, and it passes all the proposed test262 tests as well as my own

[13:13:24.0852] <Rob Palmer>

[13:16:54.0435] <rbuckton>
My impression is that the use case in that issue was a misuse of the API. Perhaps `take` may seem confusing in a vacuum, but not with adequate context

[13:19:18.0829] <littledan>
Why is it "Speaker's summary of key points" rather than "summary of key points" in the notes?

[13:19:25.0606] <Luca Casonato>
Didn't get to it due to time, but there is precedence for a `preventClose`/`preventReturn` option on the web: `preventClose` on `ReadableStream.prototype.pipeTo` and `ReadableStream.prototype.pipeThrough`. I am not necessarily in favour of adding that - but if we did, people may already be familiar with the opt out behaviour.

[13:19:32.0976] <littledan>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> Why is it "Speaker's summary of key points" rather than "summary of key points" in the notes?

I haven't really been seeing speakers fill this in; I think note-takers and the committee could fill it in as well

[13:21:25.0270] <Rob Palmer>
It can be written by anyone so please change the title if you like.  The key is that the presenter ought to be at least approving the summary so that we have some kind of responsibility when distributing the load of writing these summaries.

[13:21:49.0589] <rbuckton>
The confusion is a consequence of choosing to build an API that is dependent on `Iterator` vs the notion of an iterable. As I understood it as the proposal was advancing, basing this on `iterator` meant we were in the realm of "one shot" or "single use" iterators, and that any kind of reusable iteration would rely on arrow functions. IIRC, all of the helper methods are exhaustive, either through repeated calls to `.next` or through the use of `.return`. I don't believe `.take` should be substantially different in this regard. I would much rather have an "opt-out" mechanism to avoid closing an iterator than breaking from the norm here.

[13:24:19.0903] <bakkot>
Definitely agreed that `take` not exhausting is not an option

[13:24:32.0268] <bakkot>
the question was just whether a different name could lead people to correctly intuit the semantics

[13:25:11.0716] <shu>
my intuition is no, unless the name is literally, like `takeAndThenClose`

[13:32:43.0097] <rbuckton>
The alternative, `.limit`, only really makes sense for numeric arguments. It becomes much less clear if you later adopt something like `.limitWhile` (vs. `.takeWhile`). 

[13:33:56.0964] <bakkot>
fun fact, Java has both `limit` and `takeWhile`

[13:34:01.0171] <bakkot>
(and no `take`)

I am not necessarily in favour of adding that - but if we did, people may already be familiar with the opt out behaviour.

I know that NodeJS has that concept, i.e.`stream.pipeline(streams, { end: true })` https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v19.x/docs/api/stream.html#streampipelinestreams-options

[13:38:29.0202] <rbuckton>
and `readable.pipe(dest, { end: true })`. I'm not sure about the DOM APIs offhand

[13:39:17.0292] <Luca Casonato>
for DOM it'd be `readable.pipeTo(writable,  { preventClose: true })`

[13:39:47.0175] <rbuckton>
Yeah, I misread your comment as a question, sorry.

[13:49:37.0810] <shu>
waldemar: the core confusion from me is why do you trust multiple implementations to be correct and interoperable here, if you don't trust the spec to be correct (because it's so tricky to get correct)?

[13:49:51.0898] <shu>
like my goal isn't _just_ a correct document, it's correct interopable implementations

[13:52:12.0744] <waldemar>
shu: It sounds like you're trying to fit the spec around one possible (and pretty problematic) implementation. The spec should be implementation-agnostic about internal details.

[13:53:05.0309] <shu>
in this case my understanding is that the bounds the champions are working to put in place are precisely so that it _is_ implementable with that technique

[13:53:07.0106] <waldemar>
I'm also more interested in the ns vs µs question.

[13:53:15.0568] <shu>
(also why is the 64+32 impl problematic?)

[13:54:26.0790] <littledan>
> <@waldemarh:matrix.org> I'm also more interested in the ns vs µs question.

I know that ptomato framed this as "for future discussion" but I don't see any arguments to switch to microseconds at this point.

[13:54:37.0744] <waldemar>
Elementary math: 64+32 can implement integral counts of subseconds. This is obvious.

[13:55:20.0924] <shu>
well, V8's position is still pro microseconds, but we won't block the proposal on it if implementation complexities and bad performance cliffs are addressed

[13:55:27.0356] <waldemar>
Not obvious: spec that explicitly manages two integers implements integral counts of subseconds. It's easy to get carries and overflows wrong, and you can't tell without examining the entire spec.

[13:55:55.0814] <shu>
i agree with you

[13:56:13.0093] <shu>
what i don't get is, why do you think that trickiness is best left for implementations to all figure out via implication?

[13:56:24.0591] <waldemar>
If you just want µs, then you can store durations in flat 64-bit integers and get a much more efficient implementation with a range of >500,000 years.

[13:56:46.0855] <shu>
indeed! *i* just want us

[13:56:56.0920] <shu>
but v8 has not been able to convince the champion group

> <@waldemarh:matrix.org> If you just want µs, then you can store durations in flat 64-bit integers and get a much more efficient implementation with a range of >500,000 years.

Do we have any information that this difference in performance will be signficant? there's so much other stuff going on anyway

[13:58:05.0253] <shu>
it's a nuanced conversation that's hard to tease apart

[13:58:26.0047] <shu>
it's not just absolute performance, it's the complexity around supporting optimized paths also

[13:58:29.0671] <shu>
it's philosophical objection

[13:58:51.0766] <waldemar>
Whether a difference in performance is significant depends on who is writing the benchmark ☺

[13:59:09.0649] <shu>
apaprocki has given examples of other systems that support ns that temporal might want to interface with, which i don't really get at all

[13:59:21.0573] <apaprocki>
ns are common enough nowadays that it seems it would be limiting use cases unnecessarily by limiting to µs, e.g. node embeds v8 and would hopefully like to represent filesystem times without losing precision 

[13:59:25.0919] <shu>
those other systems don't have ns as part of a date-time arithmetic library, they're raw ns counts

[13:59:31.0145] <shu>
they're int64s

[13:59:57.0154] <shu>
what i'm saying is it doesn't follow "ns are common enough -> ns need ot be supported in a fully featured date-time arithmetic library" 

[14:00:08.0297] <shu>
you still can just put the raw ns count into a BigInt

[14:02:34.0445] <shu>
V8 position is:

- ideal: us precision, simple bounded arithmetic + storage follows straightforwardly
- can live with: ns precision, with 64+32 being a tried-and-proven implementation technique from e.g. abseil that we can use
- cannot live with: ns precision, bigint math required

[14:02:47.0123] <apaprocki>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> what i'm saying is it doesn't follow "ns are common enough -> ns need ot be supported in a fully featured date-time arithmetic library"

well, take filesystem times.. certainly those are displayed on screens as formatted date times and not counts

[14:02:59.0803] <shu>
great, it's fine to format them

[14:03:12.0989] <shu>
you need to do full arithmetic to ns precision?

[14:03:18.0717] <shu>
how is that useful?

[14:06:25.0107] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> you need to do full arithmetic to ns precision?

I haven't found this as a hard requirement for us when I talked to the relevant groups (except for certain algorithms like PTP which we probably wouldn't end up porting to JS)

[14:06:35.0169] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> you need to do full arithmetic to ns precision?

 * I haven't found this as a hard requirement for us when I talked to the relevant groups inside of Bloomberg (except for certain algorithms like PTP which we probably wouldn't end up porting to JS)

[14:08:51.0733] <apaprocki>
there are certain feeds of information where the individual events are represented in ns precision and series of events could be displayed as offsets from an initial event (in essence, durations from an arbitrary epoch rather than UTC epoch)

[14:10:00.0699] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> what i'm saying is it doesn't follow "ns are common enough -> ns need ot be supported in a fully featured date-time arithmetic library"

I think using ns would create somewhat of a risk, that Temporal might become obsolete (which is a surprising choice given how much else we decided to be super future-proof for). It's sort of clear that we don't really need to go more precise than ns.

[14:10:54.0630] <littledan>
(and a later evolution here would be really bad, given compat/interop risks)

this isn't worth bringing up, but `await` is not reserved in strict mode, only in module code and async functions

[14:28:42.0649] <Michael Ficarra>
very very few people are aware of syntax being dependent on the start symbol

[14:29:36.0312] <ljharb>
bakkot: perhaps we should have `Set.prototype.sort` if the sort order is important?

[14:30:06.0717] <Michael Ficarra>
if you're going to explicitly manage the sort order, put it in an explicitly ordered container

[14:30:08.0011] <bakkot>
the problem is that when I care about the order it's because I care about insertion order specifically

[14:30:15.0760] <bakkot>
and you can't sort it into "insertion order"

[14:32:31.0826] <ljharb>
ah true, hm

[14:35:05.0259] <Michael Ficarra>
I know we don't have much else to go on, but I feel like we're taking these poll results way too seriously

[14:35:24.0998] <bakkot>
right now we're just hearing what they are

[14:35:38.0876] <bakkot>
no one has expressed anything about what to do with them

[14:41:29.0362] <Michael Ficarra>
for await has always felt like an awkward piece of syntax to me, though

[14:41:55.0097] <Michael Ficarra>
like I don't know if we should be using it to guide future syntax choices

[14:44:04.0128] <bakkot>
tbf if we're just picking something because we have to pick something, "difficulty of parsing" is a fine reason to choose - I just wouldn't want "difficulty of parsing" to prevent us from picking a thing we do all think is best

[14:44:46.0829] <littledan>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> for await has always felt like an awkward piece of syntax to me, though

huh? it seems intuitive to me

[14:46:48.0421] <justinfagnani>
as a code reader, I kind of want a syntactic note on the block that it may await at the end, not just on individual statements in the block

[14:46:57.0596] <justinfagnani>
like `async` on a function

[14:48:33.0530] <Rob Palmer>
justin, is this just syntax shock?  I fully have the same initial reaction as you.  I just recall many times when my initial reaction is later overcome once it goes into the language and you get used to it

[14:49:10.0295] <shu>
that's not much of an argument though, because you can make that about literally syntax we choose?

[14:49:10.0331] <justinfagnani>
could be?

[14:49:14.0119] <shu>
"you'll get used to it"

[14:49:22.0426] <shu>
 * that's not much of an argument though, because you can make that about literally any syntax we choose?

[14:49:26.0480] <Rob Palmer>
That could be the JS motto.

[14:50:12.0880] <bakkot>
justinfagnani: yeah the original design was more like python's `with` or java's `try-with-resources`, which has that 

[14:50:21.0966] <bakkot>
but we ultimately decided not that

[14:50:29.0099] <justinfagnani>
Would something like:
```
async {
   await using x = y;
   foo();
}
```
make it more clear that the block may yield at the end?

[14:50:33.0891] <justinfagnani>
bakkot: ok

[14:50:37.0837] <Mathieu Hofman>

[15:05:48.0069] <shu>
the only signal i got from the past 10 minutes is, the consensus was not just "we can all live with await using" but in fact "we are now convinced `await using` is the ideal, if achieveable"

[15:05:53.0298] <shu>
which is a good signal

[15:05:57.0943] <shu>
and backs up coming back next meeting

BTW here are my conclusion notes for the await using topic, please edit in the notes if you want to make changes:

### Summary
Various grammars for async resource disposal were considered, including results from polls. The champion's preference became `await using`, and several delegates were swayed to prefer this option based on the data and arguments presented.
There are concerns about the parse-ability of `await using`, both based on practical implementations and the fit into the ES spec's cover grammars; it's unclear if certain edge cases will be easy to manage.
If `await using` isn't viable, it's likely that `async using` isn't viable, and the committee may come back to the conclusion of `using await`, but this will need to come back to plenary for future discussion.

### Conclusion

The committee resolves to attempt the syntax `await using`.
The grammar will need to be worked out in a PR, which will need to be presented in a future plenary for review and consensus.


[15:44:10.0244] <shu>
i am triggered about static private semantics

[15:44:39.0478] <Chris de Almeida>
same

[15:44:54.0817] <bakkot>
static private semantics are actually fine

[15:45:12.0691] <bakkot>
the problem is that `class extends` implies inheritance not just of instances but of _the constructors themselves_, which is wack

[15:46:15.0692] <littledan>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> the problem is that `class extends` implies inheritance not just of instances but of _the constructors themselves_, which is wack

I'm like 80% sure I agree. Constructor inheritance is definitely used.

[15:46:57.0635] <bakkot>
yeah I use it myself

[15:47:37.0798] <bakkot>
but it should never have existed, it gives us the wild things like `Promise.resolve` not working unless bound (whereas `Array.from` does, for... reasons)

[15:54:51.0113] <Michael Ficarra>
we *really* need to figure out a more appropriate organisational scheme for well-known symbols than putting them all on Symbol

[15:55:34.0964] <Michael Ficarra>
I don't blame this proposal author for this choice, since we don't have committee guidance on the topic

[15:56:31.0438] <littledan>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> we *really* need to figure out a more appropriate organisational scheme for well-known symbols than putting them all on Symbol

I don't really see the same issue; it's just a single namespace for these things, just like if we had called it `__metadata__`

[15:58:08.0598] <Michael Ficarra>
littledan: yes, a single global namespace for everything is bad, whether that is globalThis or Symbol

[15:58:34.0798] <danielrosenwasser>
Hey all, Ron (rbuckton ) and I will be requesting a new agenda item this Thursday which will propose the preferred `await using` syntax for the [Async Explicit Resource Management proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-explicit-resource-management). We're currently working on the grammar, but will let everyone know when the slides and changes are ready to review.

[15:58:35.0874] <Michael Ficarra>
ironically, that opinion is also on-topic for this topic

[15:59:23.0557] <shu>
i don't think a single global namespace is bad

[16:00:01.0605] <shu>
i think it's only ex ante bad but is mostly ok

[16:01:07.0925] <Chris de Almeida>
`var doNotPolluteTheGlobalNamespace = {};`

[16:02:35.0315] <littledan>
Option 3 feels the most bizarre to me, since the intended usage of it needs to go back to the single namespace anyway

[16:02:46.0538] <Michael Ficarra>
shu: surely with time, we will have more than 1 built-in protocol that want to use the same simple name for one of their provided/required fields

[16:03:30.0038] <shu>
that's why i said ex ante bad

[16:03:41.0897] <Michael Ficarra>
none of these well-known symbols have particularly unique simple names

[16:03:44.0980] <shu>
my point is that when we come to that bridge it's usually not a big deal to work around

[16:04:25.0565] <Michael Ficarra>
shu: fair, though it would be nice to set a precedent for userland protocols, especially if we ever have a world with first-class protocols

[16:06:23.0343] <Ashley Claymore>
which class does the metadata get added to? If there was a class decorator which returns a new class, does that get it, or should it have to make sure it 'forwards' on `Symbol.metadata' ?

[16:06:59.0574] <rbuckton>
The final class

[16:07:22.0430] <rbuckton>
(I think)

[16:07:45.0685] <Ashley Claymore>
so might not work if the decorator freezes the class

[16:07:47.0189] <Ashley Claymore>
 * so might not work if the decorator freezes the class?

[16:07:54.0096] <rbuckton>
A _good_ class decorator that performs replacement should either subclass with `extends`, unless it is doing something very complex.

[16:09:06.0150] <ljharb>
either, or what?

[16:09:42.0764] <rbuckton>
 * A _good_ class decorator that performs replacement should either subclass with `extends`, or use `.setPrototypeOf` to emulate that approach, unless it is doing something very complex.

[16:10:34.0688] <Ashley Claymore>
so `Symbol.metadata` would already be there on the class that is being decorated? Rather than added to the final class?

[16:11:04.0438] <rbuckton>
I'd have to recheck the spec

[16:13:52.0835] <shu>
i'm confused about kevin's use case

[16:14:29.0049] <bakkot>
two libraries which both want to use the key `type`

[16:14:38.0539] <bakkot>
including possibly two major versions of the same library

[16:14:46.0128] <bakkot>
you fundamentally cannot use these things at the same time

[16:15:01.0597] <bakkot>
because it's a shared global namespace

[16:15:07.0828] <shu>
is he saying programs will want multiple versions of the same decorator library in the same running app...?

[16:15:34.0624] <bakkot>
multiple versions of a library in the same app is a thing which happens constantly

[16:16:32.0796] <Luca Casonato>
rbuckton: if you want a shared global namespace in scripts, use `globalThis`? why do we need to add a second global namespace? if you really want a global namespace, there already is one already

[16:17:04.0918] <littledan>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> multiple versions of a library in the same app is a thing which happens constantly

right, I guess the question is: are we more likely to want them to share or partition the namespace? I think share is more pragmatic, given the cases we've heard about. What's more likely to work in practice?

[16:17:20.0627] <shu>
but... why is the app use two major versions of the same library in the same app? that happens?

[16:17:28.0176] <bakkot>
that happens constantly

[16:17:32.0622] <bakkot>
littledan: they can't share

[16:17:38.0673] <rbuckton>
> <@lucacasonato:matrix.org> rbuckton: if you want a shared global namespace in scripts, use `globalThis`? why do we need to add a second global namespace? if you really want a global namespace, there already is one already

That is essentially what `reflect-metadata` does, and one of the things we have sorely wanted to address with this proposal.

[16:17:39.0422] <bakkot>
like, that's the problem

[16:17:41.0650] <bakkot>
they ause the same key

[16:17:44.0692] <bakkot>
 * they use the same key

[16:17:47.0678] <shu>
it happens constantly?

[16:17:51.0130] <rbuckton>
We cannot mutate `globalThis` in a locked down environment like SES

[16:17:51.0819] <bakkot>
and coordinating it becomes the consumer's problem

[16:17:53.0381] <Jesse (TC39)>
the various layers of dependency hell

[16:18:27.0879] <littledan>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> littledan: they can't share

I don't see why this is such an absolute, rather than pragmatic, thing

[16:18:32.0126] <shu>
okay i think i'm getting the picture. currently the builders do some kind of deduplication / versioning at the build step for regular import/exports

[16:18:36.0226] <rbuckton>
Also, `[Symbol.metadata]` isn't necessarily a "global namespace" any more than a static property on the class is a global namespace. Because the `[Symbol.metadata]` property _is_ a static property on a class.

[16:19:06.0979] <bakkot>
rbuckton: right, class fields are also a shared namespace, which is why string-named mixins was not a viable proposal

[16:19:51.0818] <littledan>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> rbuckton: right, class fields are also a shared namespace, which is why string-named mixins was not a viable proposal

Symbol-named protocols are also not beyond Stage 1; I still like string-named mixing.

[16:20:01.0209] <rbuckton>
There's a difference between "shared namespace" and "global namespace" though. The 2nd term has more implications

[16:20:02.0006] <littledan>

[16:20:25.0140] <bakkot>
the names of all fields used in all decorators anywhere must be unique

[16:20:26.0501] <bakkot>
that's global

[16:20:37.0160] <rbuckton>
I want a mutable object _because_ I don't want a shared _global_ namespace.

[16:21:03.0959] <rbuckton>
The alternative to use `globalThis` mandates I do the worse thing

[16:21:13.0143] <bakkot>
rbuckton: but only you

[16:21:14.0723] <Michael Ficarra>
"be careful" assumes that all parties are coordinating, but in reality, pages and applications are often composed of many non-coordinating scripts

[16:21:20.0904] <bakkot>
I am OK with only typescript having to do the worse thing

[16:21:29.0099] <bakkot>
as long as everyone else falls into the happy path of the right thing

[16:21:41.0951] <rbuckton>
Its not only typescript, its every typescript user.

[16:22:10.0865] <ljharb>
TS users presumably would only use an interface TS provides

[16:22:14.0185] <littledan>

You only have to worry about the set of decorators that a particular class uses.

 * TS users presumably would only use an interface TS provides, regardless of which option was chosen?

[16:23:12.0423] <Michael Ficarra>

[16:23:36.0238] <nicolo-ribaudo>

> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> Decorators from different libraries can usually be mixed, so the decorator author doesn't really know what this set is

`Symbol.for("foo")` isn't much better than `"foo"`

[16:27:32.0974] <bakkot>
I didn't mention this, but the other downside of option 1 is that it is public-by-default, which is... very bad

no it isn't

[16:27:56.0570] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> I didn't mention this, but the other downside of option 1 is that it is public-by-default, which is... very bad

There is no default. Its purely based on usage. 

[16:28:08.0037] <bakkot>
it is not as a easy to use a weakmap as it is to use a string-named property

[16:28:29.0434] <rbuckton>
But option 2 has the same level of difficulty with weakmaps

[16:28:54.0704] <bakkot>
yes but that's the only way to use it, so that's fine

[16:29:05.0551] <bakkot>
like, as a practical matter, people are going to use public string-named properties with option 1, even when they don't intend to make a public API

[16:29:08.0483] <bakkot>
that is what is going to happen

[16:29:18.0673] <bakkot>
that is what "public-by-default" means

[16:31:01.0734] <rbuckton>
That is more about documentation and learning than it is about capability. If you tell folks, use `WeakMap` or `Symbol`, if you're concerned about collisions, but strings or `Symbol.for` if you're not. Library authors will almost certainly avoid collisions, end user applications often won't need to.

You have a lot more faith in the power of documentation to shape what happens than I do

Assignments to `context.metadata` will never be so symbol as `context.metadata["a"] = b` anyways

[16:32:08.0603] <littledan>
I really appreciate you being flexible here, bakkot ljharb Michael Ficarra . It's great that we're able to move forward and not have a big gap of metadata-less decorators

[16:32:10.0699] <rbuckton>
 * Assignments to `context.metadata` will never be so simple as `context.metadata["a"] = b` anyways

[16:32:42.0373] <rbuckton>
`context.metadata` is just an object. If you need to differentiate between a class, or a method, or a field you still have more work to do to avoid collisions, even in the `WeakMap` case.

[16:32:49.0981] <Justin Ridgewell>
Is the `context` object (not the `context.metadata` obj) consistent between all decorator invocations on a particular class?

[16:32:57.0366] <Justin Ridgewell>
Or is it a new object for every invocation?

[16:33:09.0032] <rbuckton>
Same object for every decorator on a single class

[16:33:21.0683] <rbuckton>
including the methods and fields.

[16:34:03.0250] <Justin Ridgewell>
If we had chosen Option 2 here, would there even have been a need for `context.metadataKey` at all?

[16:34:15.0750] <Justin Ridgewell>
We could have just keyed the `WeakMap` on `context`

[16:34:18.0484] <rbuckton>
```js
@((_, ctx) => { ctx.metadata["a"] = 1; })
class C {
  @((_, ctx) => { ctx.metadata["b"] = 2; })
  method() {}
}
```
produces a single object with `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`

[16:34:23.0439] <bakkot>
yeah you need it to be available after decoration time

[16:34:29.0746] <bakkot>
and you don't want to share the `context` object

[16:34:36.0275] <bakkot>
which has a bunch of decorator-time-only stuff on it

[16:34:42.0972] <Justin Ridgewell>
Ah, ok

[16:34:45.0017] <rbuckton>
sorry, I misread.

[16:34:51.0692] <rbuckton>
`context` is not shared, only metadata is.

[16:35:10.0461] <rbuckton>
 * sorry, I misread (despite your clarification).

Good morning, all.  Plenary begins in one hour.

[09:27:16.0857] <rbuckton>
For those interested, I have two draft PRs up that illustrate the potential cover grammars for `await using` and `async using`:
- `await using`: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-explicit-resource-management/pull/15
- `async using`: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-explicit-resource-management/pull/16

[10:20:15.0551] <ptomato>
I thought it was fine, I had no problem with the process, personally

[10:21:45.0300] <yulia>

[10:22:10.0487] <Michael Ficarra>
I already love this presentation

[10:34:05.0592] <Justin Ridgewell>
Wait, he said "next slide" right?

[10:34:14.0416] <Justin Ridgewell>

[10:48:31.0390] <Michael Ficarra>
this seems like a thing that we, as language designers, would notice and/or care about, but users of the language don't want to care about this distinction or have to pass around an awkward intermediate opaque value because of it

[10:49:30.0448] <ryzokuken>
feature request: import/export queue as YAML

[10:49:57.0964] <Jack Works>
some though:
```js
import source wasm from './x.wasm'
// and
import wasm from './x.wasm'
```

both give us reference to undeniable host objects.

[10:50:37.0451] <Michael Ficarra>
I mean that depends on the embedder, right?

[10:51:21.0377] <Michael Ficarra>
the embedder could add hooks for denying that, surely

[10:51:22.0347] <Jack Works>
yes. since it already happens today, IMO we no need to care about deniability in this syntax.

[11:08:42.0875] <Andreu Botella>
Wait, so `import x from "test"` and `import x from "test" with {}` would have different cache keys?

[11:08:53.0542] <littledan>
in that case, no

[11:09:22.0937] <littledan>
keep in mind, it's not that all attributes result in a differing cache key at the host level, they might be normalized just like relative paths

[11:10:10.0803] <Andreu Botella>

[11:12:56.0482] <yulia>
erm, ok. i have maybe a solution to what mark is asking

[11:12:59.0212] <yulia>
i have a slide deck

[11:13:06.0254] <yulia>
but it wasn't totally ready

[11:13:57.0576] <yulia>
I will probably do it as a blog post after i've had a chance to talk to the other modules folks

[11:13:57.0590] <Andreu Botella>
oh, I just checked the spec and it is actually the same cache key, my bad

[11:14:06.0152] <Andreu Botella>
 * oh, I just checked the proposed spec text and it is actually the same cache key, my bad

[11:14:19.0782] <yulia>

[11:14:42.0867] <yulia>
its out of date, please don't take it as anything concrete

[11:15:45.0636] <yulia>
I took it off the agenda because it wasn't concrete but i can talk about it briefly

[11:15:59.0682] <littledan>
I'd encourage you to add this to the agenda as well as the queue

[11:16:25.0802] <Michael Ficarra>
I think Mark was probably just unaware of the coordination already happening between the module proposal authors

[11:16:28.0384] <Rob Palmer>
I've been impressed with how much coordination and participation has gone into the various modules proposals

[11:18:37.0220] <Jesse (TC39)>
OT yulia presented some stuff about this module work (including layering/process improcements) at BOBKonf 2023 just last week (great talk!) https://bobkonf.de/2023/startsev.html

[11:18:56.0513] <yulia>
its very out of date already

[11:19:12.0637] <Jesse (TC39)>
in one week? JS moves faster than I thought!

[11:19:29.0874] <yulia>
yes, i have the wrong names already, probably because i was writing the talk a couple of months ago

[11:19:33.0823] <littledan>
I think it'd be much better to discuss this internally in TC39, even if very very unfinished, before you leave (and maybe this will feed into the blog post, even)

[11:19:58.0920] <littledan>
the bar for something we're discussing just internally should be logically lower than what goes into a public-facing blog post

[11:22:41.0313] <yulia>
my view on layering doesn't need to be adopted, its just my thinking

[11:22:51.0184] <ljharb>
littledan: afaik node already decided to reflag

[11:23:03.0027] <yulia>
and blocking that from going public is something i am against because i have reasons for my opinions even if tc39 disagrees

[11:23:05.0115] <bakkot>
honestly the slow path seems totally fine as long as we update docs and stuff?

[11:23:12.0763] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> littledan: afaik node already decided to reflag

interesting, I guess they don't need a signal from us?

[11:23:18.0411] <bakkot>
like if no new code uses it, I don't see a problem

[11:23:23.0084] <bakkot>
 * like if no new code uses `assert`, I don't see a problem

[11:23:32.0325] <ljharb>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> interesting, I guess they don't need a signal from us?

they reflagged because they had no signal, and the future of the syntax was uncertain

[11:23:37.0953] <Michael Ficarra>
bakkot: it's a bit scary, you don't want to have adoption of the legacy variant increase

[11:23:47.0299] <Michael Ficarra>
hopefully implementations can warn through some side channel

[11:24:15.0764] <bakkot>
console warning would be good too yeah

[11:24:45.0465] <Michael Ficarra>
console warning only if mtime > March TC39 meeting lol

[11:24:56.0362] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> they reflagged because they had no signal, and the future of the syntax was uncertain

has a release actually gone out with the re-flagging?

[11:25:11.0829] <ljharb>
i don't think so yet

[11:27:14.0268] <eemeli>
Do we have any precedent for a MAY or SHOULD statement on emitting warnings for deprecated syntax?

[11:27:52.0009] <bakkot>
nope

[11:27:57.0053] <Michael Ficarra>
eemeli: we have no jurisdiction there

[11:28:24.0147] <bakkot>
we can give suggestions but like we can also give suggestions to Shu, in words

[11:28:48.0365] <shu>
like yes i am not a generative AI

[11:30:12.0985] <eemeli>
Tbf, I think we're just established that it's not just Chrome.

[11:30:42.0571] <bakkot>
does node ever do warnings? warnings from node can break stuff

[11:30:45.0141] <bakkot>
bundlers could, though

[11:30:56.0719] <bakkot>
I guess it does ever do warnings; I have seen some

[11:31:23.0695] <littledan>
> <@yulia:mozilla.org> and blocking that from going public is something i am against because i have reasons for my opinions even if tc39 disagrees

Sorry I did not mean that I or anyone should block you from doing anything, it just seems like you're hesitant to present something unfinished to us and I was trying to encourage you that it'd be OK to share.

[11:31:25.0485] <eemeli>
At least for flagged features, it does.

[11:32:19.0310] <Michael Ficarra>
doesn't do warnings? I have an UnhandledPromiseRejection for you

[11:32:34.0098] <ljharb>
node def does warnings, and has a caching mechanism so it only shows it to you once per process

[11:32:50.0436] <bakkot>
UnhandledPromiseRejection now crashes the process by default, I think

its not that much of an evolution of what we've discussed in the module calls

[11:33:50.0557] <yulia>
you will notice things are on different layers and the layers are named

Are there any annex features that don't run on all major browsers?

[11:39:58.0719] <danielrosenwasser>

[11:40:29.0928] <ryzokuken>
editorial notes could help?

[11:40:57.0268] <shu>

[11:41:14.0172] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@danielrosenwasser:matrix.org> Are there any annex features that don't run on all major browsers?

This would not be annex b -- annex b must be implemented by all browsers

[11:41:17.0557] <ryzokuken>
I mean, we could include it with a big banner that says "careful"

[11:41:39.0733] <Jack Works>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> This would not be annex b -- annex b must be implemented by all browsers

annex b + normative optional 😂

[11:41:41.0784] <danielrosenwasser>
ah, I see. I'm just trying to understand better.

[11:42:18.0208] <eemeli>
Annex C, anyone? 😇

[11:42:21.0663] <shu>
it is fine if committee wants the lesson V8 to learn from this is "conformance as a proxy measure for shipping reality becomes even more tenuous"

[11:42:33.0028] <shu>
but that will weak TC39's pull in the future, to be clear

[11:43:08.0941] <ljharb>
i'm confused. why would supporting `assert` syntax make you noncompliant?

[11:43:19.0359] <shu>
 * but that will weaken TC39's pull in the future, to be clear

[11:43:28.0412] <ljharb>
the spec already explicitly allows implementations to go nuts with their own syntax

[11:43:33.0770] <bakkot>
speaking of, I still need to specify the `if (false) f() = 0` syntax...

[11:44:14.0576] <bakkot>
ljharb: I do not think we want implementations to think of themselves as being allowed to go nuts with their own syntax, regardless of whether the spec says they are allowed to

[11:44:14.0969] <ljharb>
i very much wouldn't want to make important implementations noncompliant, but omitting `assert` from the spec doesn't seem like it would cause that.

[11:44:21.0839] <ljharb>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> ljharb: I do not think we want implementations to think of themselves as being allowed to go nuts with their own syntax, regardless of whether the spec says they are allowed to

very true

[11:44:30.0124] <shu>
it is no skin off my back to start going nuts with syntax

[11:44:30.0360] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> it is fine if committee wants the lesson V8 to learn from this is "conformance as a proxy measure for shipping reality becomes even more tenuous"

I don't think V8 should take that lesson; it was clear that the committee largely *does* see the spec reflecting reality as a goal.

[11:44:58.0417] <shu>
but more narrowly, because the spec needs to say `assert` has the same semantics as `with`

[11:44:59.0972] <ljharb>
i see that as a goal as well. but it has a purpose beyond that in that it guides new implementations

[11:45:11.0480] <shu>
that's what the "legacy" box is for

[11:45:18.0118] <shu>
that is literally why that box exists

[11:45:36.0331] <ljharb>
sure. but that's for stuff that all browsers already implement. this one's just chrome

[11:46:13.0338] <bakkot>
`Legacy` is actually "must implement"

[11:46:24.0840] <shu>
sorry, normative optional + legacy

[11:46:27.0848] <bakkot>
but `Legacy` plus `Normative Optional` does the thing yes

[11:46:43.0580] <ljharb>
maybe the solution is to invent a new category that's more strongly worded and implies both legacy and normative optional, i dunno

[11:46:46.0449] <Jack Works>
can we try? maybe the migration isn't that hard considering code using import assertions are new and highly likely in maintaining

[11:46:52.0371] <ryzokuken>
odd sidebar, since I'm curious: is it a possibility to eventually move `Date` to this "legacy" section?

[11:47:01.0749] <ljharb>
 but there is a distinct difference to me between the string HTML methods, and the `assert` syntax

[11:47:06.0639] <littledan>
> <@usharma:igalia.com> odd sidebar, since I'm curious: is it a possibility to eventually move `Date` to this "legacy" section?

no? this is a confusing tangent

[11:47:17.0658] <ryzokuken>
yes, sorry

[11:47:18.0247] <ljharb>
seems very unlikely

[11:47:19.0069] <Andreu Botella>

wonder the real world use rate in Web of Import assertions

[11:49:44.0665] <Jack Works>
is there any data of it?

[11:49:58.0226] <Jesse (TC39)>
> <@jackworks:matrix.org> wonder the real world use rate in Web of Import assertions

I think yulia might have some data there?

[11:49:59.0958] <HE Shi-Jun>
> <@jackworks:matrix.org> wonder the real world use rate in Web of Import assertions

I believe it's very low

[11:50:16.0020] <yulia>
chrome would be the one with the counters

[11:50:18.0601] <justinfagnani>
it has to be very, very low

[11:50:30.0615] <Jack Works>
> <@jesse:igalia.com> I think yulia might have some data there?

but firefox does not ship it?

[11:50:45.0517] <yulia>
at the moment, no

[11:50:50.0431] <yulia>
we have an implementation but it is unshipped

[11:51:01.0888] <yulia>
safari likewise has it behind a flag

[11:51:18.0096] <ljharb>
it would be a really unfortunate outcome imo if anyone newly ships it unflagged (prior to time + evidence that it's unshakeable web reality)

[11:51:34.0393] <yulia>
i believe assert is most used by tooling, Justin Ridgewell would have the context here

[11:51:38.0045] <ljharb>
and given how new this feature is, it seems entirely achievable for everyone using `assert` to migrate to `with`

[11:52:01.0145] <bakkot>
eventually

[11:52:10.0899] <ljharb>
sure, in the fullness of time. but i think on a reasonably short timescale

[11:52:38.0878] <ljharb>
if every browser, and node/deno, shipped `with` today, i'd expect `assert` to be gone in like a year

[11:52:40.0354] <justinfagnani>
the most likely usage is in v8-only environments: Deno, Node, Electron, etc... but those are versioned and also have breaking changes somewhat regularly

[11:52:42.0218] <ljharb>
 * if every browser, and node/deno, shipped `with` today, i'd expect `assert` to be largely gone in like a year

[11:54:02.0172] <Jack Works>
(IIRC some linux let apps use shared electron so maybe for electron it's not so versioned)

[11:54:06.0850] <justinfagnani>
v8 use counters would need to differentiate web from server (if any server env even contributes to use counters, which I doubt?)

[11:54:21.0411] <ljharb>
p sure use counters are in chrome, not v8?

[11:54:24.0644] <justinfagnani>
ah, counter would be web-only

[11:54:43.0872] <shu>
yeah that use counter infra is chrome only i think

[11:55:01.0558] <bakkot>
node's ability to ever ship breaking changes is great, I love that; I also appreciate that it happens quite rarely these days

[11:55:07.0219] <Jack Works>
does Electron has use counter?  🧐

[11:55:21.0800] <bakkot>
I have not had an issue updating a major version of node since 10->12

[11:55:25.0148] <justinfagnani>
I don't know... seems like some sort of metrics would have been useful from server / desktop environments, but I admit I don't know of any that do

[11:55:46.0831] <shu>
this is just the consequence of our staging and shipping model

[11:55:50.0459] <shu>

(Node 18 new SSL provider breaks Webpack 4)

[11:56:52.0314] <bakkot>
fortunately webpack is usually a direct dep rather than a transitive dep, so that's not too bad

[11:58:08.0700] <Jack Works>
if we're interested in spec purity, we won't have IsHTMLDDA today

[11:58:32.0179] <ljharb>
*un*fortunately tho, lots of people can't upgrade to webpack 5 because of its node core module polyfilling change, so unless a fix is backported to v4 lots of people will be stuck

ljharb: I would prefer the committee not give too much editorial direction here. I want to retain discretion to best communicate what we understand the committee's opinion to be here.

[12:00:03.0470] <bakkot>

+1 to Jordan's comments about the spec being explicit about the hope to remove it (though I'd note that normative-optional advocates like to think the same thing about those sections)

[12:01:41.0512] <msaboff>
Annex B is evidence that we don't have spec purity.  I'd rather that we don't decrease purity.

[12:02:16.0489] <shu>
that's fair, but the bar for me is "is this true of the world", not "is this a wish we have of the world"

[12:02:22.0833] <shu>
and as i said we can find that out empirically

[12:02:45.0376] <shu>
 * that's fair, but the bar for me for when it's acceptable to decrease purity is "is this true of the world", not "is this a wish we have of the world"

ljharb: Where would I find the draft standard for patent opt out review?

[13:07:29.0224] <littledan>
Draft notes for the conclusion for import attributes, please edit the notes if you want to refine anything:

#### Summary
Import attributes are the path forward for the standard, having re-achieved Stage 3.
The keyword is `with`
As previously, there is an options bag following it
The options can form part of the interpretation of the module and "cache key"
Unknown attributes in the import statement cause an error.
Although a couple delegates would prefer sticking with the keyword `assert`, the majority preferred switching to the long-term optimal solution of being more semantically well-aligned using `with`
Significant debate focused around how to communicate the deprecation.

#### Conclusion
`assert` will remain in the specification, marked somehow as "deprecated", with the intention to remove it eventually, though with an anticipated timespan of at least multiple years before final removal.
JS environments which currently ship `assert` are *not* encouraged to remove it, but environments which do not yet ship `assert` are discouraged from shipping it.
Chrome will gather data on usage of `assert` on the web, which can inform the deprecation path.
Conditional consensus for Stage 3 on this proposal, with the conditions:
Reviews are still needed from the reviewers who volunteered – JRL and JHD, as well as the editors
The wording for normative optional+legacy needs to be updated to something stronger, probably "deprecated", and explaining the goal to remove it from the specification.


[13:08:26.0040] <ljharb>

it hasn't been produced/cut yet, so for now you can look at https://tc39.es/ecma262, but i'll create a github release on the spec repo, and a Reflector issue, and i'll post it in here, when it's prepared

I actually did not know until looking at this issue that python's `range` does not allow floats, which I think is indicative of how rarely it comes up (at least in the kind of code I tend to write)

 * I actually did not know until looking at this issue that python's `range` does not allow non-integer values, which I think is indicative of how rarely it comes up (at least in the kind of code I tend to write)

[13:13:41.0961] <shu>
were floating point use cases the champion considers compelling presented?

[13:13:44.0012] <msaboff>
Seems like **integer only** makes a lot of sense.

[13:13:59.0801] <shu>
i am not understanding who is advocating for floats

[13:14:04.0644] <shu>
(tab is not here)

[13:14:38.0720] <bakkot>
tab advocated non-integers, hax opposed; we are here to find out what the committee as a whole things

[13:14:50.0035] <bakkot>
more people need to express opinions

[13:14:54.0337] <shu>
but are there use cases?

[13:14:58.0893] <shu>
my intuition is strongly integer only

[13:15:21.0064] <shu>
like... why are you doing 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9?

[13:17:52.0948] <rbuckton>
For reference, Python's `range()` doesn't allow floats.

[13:19:02.0001] <shu>
from https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Number.range/issues/64, tab says: "Ranges that include floating-point numbers are perfectly fine and reasonable, and people will want to do them - if we arbitrarily restrict it from this API people will just write their own and be justifiably angry at us for screwing up the API and forcing them to reinvent it themselves."

[13:19:19.0780] <shu>
but... really?

[13:19:33.0678] <bakkot>
I found the linked stackoverflow question about python's range informative: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/477486/how-do-i-use-a-decimal-step-value-for-range

[13:20:49.0109] <shu>
what's your take from that SO question?

[13:20:59.0101] <bakkot>
people aren't mad about it, basically

[13:21:05.0931] <shu>
mine is "if we restrict it, people will ask, and be told how to do it correctly, instead of being mad and also doing it wrong"

[13:21:13.0393] <shu>
okay i think that matches with mine

[13:21:15.0037] <bakkot>
or like, reasonable people can give a good answer to the question that is not just "this is a bug"

[13:21:19.0209] <shu>
right

[13:21:27.0275] <bakkot>
possibly some people are mad about it somewhere but clearly not everyone

[13:21:48.0677] <shu>
i don't know how you can be mad at "hold on now, have you heard about rounding errors"

[13:22:29.0826] <bakkot>
oh I'm mad about that, but in the way that I am mad about entropy, not the way that I am mad about idk strings being utf-16 or whatever

[13:22:49.0320] <Michael Ficarra>
I bet most JS programmers don't even know what a float is, and just treat JS numbers as if they were reals

[13:23:03.0544] <Michael Ficarra>
they don't want to hear about rounding errors

[13:23:18.0831] <bakkot>
well if `range()` doesn't allow floats then they won't have to

[13:23:30.0495] <bakkot>
if they put floats in range then they will have to learn about them

[13:24:26.0086] <eemeli>
I found it interesting that these "fail" in slightly different ways:
```

0.2
0.30000000000000004
0.4
0.5
0.6000000000000001
0.7000000000000001
0.8
0.9

> for (let i = 0; i < 1; i += 0.1) console.log(i)
0
0.1

0.7999999999999999
0.8999999999999999
0.9999999999999999
```

[13:24:32.0305] <bakkot>
(to be clear I'm just repeating things Hax already put in the issue, not finding things myself)

[13:26:51.0887] <bakkot>
ljharb: when we say "disallow floats" everyone means "disallow non-integer numbers"

[13:26:59.0571] <bakkot>
no one is suggesting not allowing integral floats

[13:27:10.0701] <bakkot>
though there is some question about whether to allow numbers above max-safe-int

[13:29:48.0348] <Michael Ficarra>
yes I wish we would stop saying "disallow floats", it is confusing people

[13:33:36.0775] <bakkot>
to be clear, this is also how floats work in python; that's how floats work in every language. but python disallows non-integer floats in `range`, and that's fine

[13:33:45.0654] <bakkot>
so it clearly is a thing that a language can choose to do

[13:34:50.0722] <shu>
no the lack of use cases is specifically about range

[13:34:54.0152] <shu>
not about floating point numbers

[14:43:46.0109] <littledan>
My point was going to be: I think the more important reason (than performance) for decimal over rational is, the very core and common operation of rounding makes sense for decimals in a way which is a sort of mismatch for rationals. This is very common in financial calculations, to have well-defined rounding of intermediate values.

Utility as something built-in here is analogous to something like Temporal--it ends up being useful to have some things built-in sometimes. I think this is about the use cases being persuasive enough, which maybe we haven't shown.

[14:48:03.0655] <shu>
what is a vocabulary type again

[14:48:31.0271] <apaprocki>
literally every single software product/language that exists has decimal, so making NxM products all flow through JS is burdensome 

[14:48:33.0197] <littledan>
like, if we have something built-in, then all the different libraries know that they can use it. This comes up for Promises, Temporal, Decimal, and more

[14:48:47.0622] <shu>
"vocabulary type" means "built-in"?

[14:49:05.0855] <apaprocki>
vocabulary meaning, a concept of interchange between languages/systems

even within the same language/system

[14:49:14.0586] <shu>

regexp

Every character can be escaped into something that would be valid in a _ClassAtom_

[15:06:10.0119] <Justin Ridgewell>
You can't match a `` ` `` in a TTL built RegExp

[15:06:48.0576] <waldemar>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> anyone know _why_ IEEE decimal distinguishes between 1.2 and 1.20?

It's just that, unlike IEEE binary which always has an implied 1 as the leading mantissa digit for non-denorms, there are multiple bit patterns that can represent the same IEEE decimal number because the leading mantissa digit can be 0 through 9. For example, there are hundreds of ways to represent +0 as a IEEE decimal, and they're all different and distinguishable.
The situation is similar to how UTF-8 was originally defined: there were multiple ways to encode "a" (either as a single byte, as two bytes, as three bytes, etc.). Eventually this became enough of a problem that UTF-8 was changed to ban encodings other than the shortest possible ones.

You can, but not easily. You would have to do `` RegExp`${"`"}` ``, which isn't ideal but it is feasible.

That would be written as `/\\/` to match `s = "\\"`

``` re`\` ``` is invalid syntax

[15:12:17.0839] <rbuckton>
Yeah, though your comment indicates that `\` in a RegExp template is impossible, when it seems pretty consistent with RegExp literals

[15:12:37.0208] <Justin Ridgewell>
And ``` re`\\` ``` only matches `s = "\\\\"`

Yes, could we not detect that case when parsing from a template tag?

`` /`/ `` and `` /\\/ `` cannot be represented

Asumu is primarily addressing the feedback that we ought to explore whether runtime-types should be in-scope.

[15:44:05.0374] <Michael Ficarra>
for proponents of runtime types, what do you expect an engine to do if the declared type is incorrect and an engine optimises based on that type? is it now permitted to have a different result? UB?

[15:44:25.0311] <Justin Ridgewell>
eemeli ljharb I think Asumu is addressing runtime vs compile time in this presentation, and not unification.

[15:45:32.0392] <ljharb>
feel free to move mine to the end of the list, but i still want to bring it up if there's time

[15:47:37.0777] <eemeli>
Same, because this proposal continues to focus on the technical details of a specific solution, and not addressing their stated main goal.

[15:47:54.0753] <Justin Ridgewell>
Ok

[15:48:14.0903] <Justin Ridgewell>
I agree that this is an important topic for the overall proposal, just not sure if he's prepared to address them

Please feel free to ask these kinds of big-picture questions; they seem important at this stage

[15:48:51.0704] <danielrosenwasser>

[15:49:42.0371] <eemeli>

[15:50:41.0550] <Chris de Almeida>
agree -- folks should be heard, but I think it's reasonable to let folks comment on the presentation topic first.  especially as this is not moving for advancement

[15:52:21.0887] <rbuckton>
I'm personally less interested in "unforking" or "unification", but more interested in cutting down development time by avoiding a compile step to get from writing code to running code faster.

[15:53:03.0703] <Michael Ficarra>
there have been some truly excellent presentations at this meeting!

rbuckton: Agreed. But that's not what's presented as the proposal's motivation.

[15:54:23.0327] <eemeli>
And it's not a part of the problem statement that was accepted a year ago.

[15:55:07.0616] <Rob Palmer>

TypeScript is gradually typed because you can declare some types and not others!!

[16:06:02.0115] <shu>
lol

[16:06:21.0723] <littledan>
No, seriously, given the diversity of meanings of gradual typing (where people unironically use the above form), we deliberately omitted it from this presentation

[16:06:40.0340] <littledan>
Asumu's PhD thesis was on sound gradual typing in Racket (he cited it in the talk!)

[16:07:27.0556] <Rob Palmer>
yes - when Asumu said there was material on the subject he was referring to his own paper

[16:07:56.0168] <littledan>
tl;dr you might be able to use some fancy compiler techniques to make sound Scheme type enforcement not have way too much of a performance penalty (though it breaks down for JS, as Assume explained)

NLTH means "no line terminator" ?

> <@waldemarh:matrix.org> I don't understand DE's claim that all the things we've been adding to the language since ES6 are "unifying" the language.

If I said "all", then that was misspeaking by me; I do think it's been a big theme in our work.

[16:24:18.0021] <HE Shi-Jun>
Michael Ficarra: So type is complex and seems need line terminators.

[16:24:47.0999] <littledan>
Even when we add things to the standard library like Array.prototype.group or Temporal, we're unifying the ecosystem where previously people had to use various different libraries to get that functionality.

littledan, danielrosenwasser : Is the big-picture vision that you talked about presented in text anywhere? I think that's the sort of motivation and explanation that I'm most missing here, because I don't see how type annotations can get us from here to there.

[16:25:52.0370] <rbuckton>
`{ a: b } =>` can't be an arrow function or arrow type? I would expect `{}` to be far more limited than `()` and `[]`, at least.

[16:26:41.0830] <rbuckton>
Also, this `foo < a ;` is addressed by the "turbofish" syntax `::<>`, i.e. `foo::< a`

[16:26:51.0411] <littledan>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> is there seriously no [NLTH] in the proposed grammar?

Yeah, fundamentally you don't get into this general token soup space without a paren, so you just have space for a token, or one of the productions that's explicitly there

It's fine to ask us to clarify the explainer more, and I'd be happy to talk with you in more detail about how/where our current readme or presentation fails to make this case. At the same time, I'm a bit offended by the implication that the champion group doesn't know what it's trying to get at, just because the documents weren't written in a way which was sufficiently clear/persuasive to everyone.

The class fields transition is significantly harder, because it's different semantics for the same syntax. This is just a syntax subset, completely statically visible with no ambiguity as to how it should run.

[16:42:54.0484] <littledan>

(Responsible) evolution of TypeScript is in some ways easier than evolving JS because it's already accepted that regular upgrades of TypeScript are mild (responsibly managed) breaking changes.  People accept this and spend effort upgrading.  The benefits are worth it.

[16:43:23.0948] <danielrosenwasser>

[16:43:53.0296] <shu>
and so this is also already solved by writing your own code?

[16:44:00.0081] <rbuckton>
Another example might be TypeScript's type cast syntax. We've always had `<T>value`, but added `value as T` to avoid ambiguity with JSX/TSX. We may never fully move everyone to `value as T`, but most TS code I see today uses `as`.

so type arguments on invocations - we prefer the existing syntax, but

2. Rust (everyone's new favorite language) has shown that people are fine with something like `f::<T, U>(...)

Sorry, Shu, I'm trying to understand, what are you getting at? E.g., for the `<T>value` syntax, what harm does it do if TS has a mode that accepts that, and JS never will, but it might support a large other subset of TS/Flow?

[16:46:45.0775] <bakkot>
but there's better syntax for it

[16:46:56.0946] <HE Shi-Jun>
`async let` have some difficulty in JS (eg. variable capture), but I hope we can explore the possibility.

[16:47:12.0087] <ljharb>
i'm sure we could but that sounds like a different proposal maybe?

[16:47:14.0927] <littledan>
I think the important thing for the TSX transitions was, can people "live in TSX"? and in that sense, it was a complete success

[16:47:38.0368] <littledan>
it needs to be that the syntax that Type Annotations supports is enough to live in; it doesn't need to take over all existing code IMO.

[16:47:45.0723] <HE Shi-Jun>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> i'm sure we could but that sounds like a different proposal maybe?

If it's for the same problem, shouldn't it in one proposal?

is it the same problem?

[16:47:51.0559] <Michael Ficarra>
I think an `all` analogue is fine, the others seem to only make sense on unnamed collections

[16:47:52.0954] <rbuckton>
I don't even know what I'd use `Promise.raceOwnProperties` for.

[16:48:15.0097] <ljharb>

i understand that the whole point of this proposal is to bring TS syntax "into the fold". the harm is that if the promise is actually "we will work to converge TS and JS syntax in the future", that sounds like ecosystem divergence to me and i do not have the risk appetite for that

[16:50:32.0458] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> i understand that the whole point of this proposal is to bring TS syntax "into the fold". the harm is that if the promise is actually "we will work to converge TS and JS syntax in the future", that sounds like ecosystem divergence to me and i do not have the risk appetite for that

Yeah, this is why the syntax *is* aligned with TS and Flow for the most part. If we end up doing something like add `::<`, it would be in conjunction with the change on the TS side (it's not even in the current grammar yet).

I've used `Promise.all(promises)` to avoid a waterfall when queueing up operations where I only need to wait for completion, so I wouldn't say the fact that its list-oriented is just due to "that's what we had at the time'

[16:52:11.0620] <bakkot>
yes, sorry, I was speaking loosely

[16:52:31.0920] <bakkot>
there's really two uses - when you have a homogenous list, where you're probably not destructuring, and where you have a heterogenous list, where you probably are

[16:52:42.0634] <bakkot>
Promise.all is perfect for the first case but awkward for the second

[16:53:56.0984] <rbuckton>
Or when you want to avoid repetition for non-degenerate cases like how the example started out.

[16:55:17.0187] <rbuckton>
`const { foo, bar } = Promise.ownProperties({ foo: getFoo(), bar: getBar() })` isn't an improvement over `const [foo, bar] = Promise.all([getFoo(), getBar()])` until you reach a level of complexity where that becomes unmanageable (as was illustrated in the example).

[16:56:39.0047] <bakkot>
I think 2 items is probably the limit though

[16:56:56.0520] <bakkot>
like when I have APIs which return 2 values I might return an unnamed pair, but as soon as it's 3 I'm going to name them instead

[16:57:51.0099] <justinfagnani>
the difference with `await Promise.all()` and function parameters is that you need to lists to use Promise.all vs one args list at the call site for a function (of course a function as a parameter list, but we can't eliminate that)

[16:58:06.0302] <rbuckton>
That said, I'm very much in favor of this as its fairly easy to exhaust that minimum complexity bar for `Promise.all()`. I'm not terribly enthusiastic about `await.` syntax, in general. I think an API approach is the right direction for now. 

[16:58:08.0592] <justinfagnani>
it's cumbersome to keep these lists in sync, and hard to read when they get long

[16:58:13.0403] <shu>
okay, on the motivation front i am now convinced, and this boils down to kevin's reason: "Promise.all is special, because the ordering of its input list is not semantically meaningful, and so is harder to keep track of mentally. except you _have_ to keep track of it mentally because it must match up to the output list"

but it seems not have big benefit for simple case :)

[17:09:19.0062] <rbuckton>
I'm fairly certain a cover grammar is feasible for `await using`, the big question is whether what I have put together is correct. Given the NLT restrictions, an `await using` declaration must have the first identifier in the binding list on the same line as `await using`, and that is always a syntax error in the expression case. Binding patterns aren't permitted in `using`, so there is no ambiguity with `await using [x]`.

[17:10:06.0968] <shu>
i'm gonna level with you rbuckton, i do not have enough brainpower left today to vet that cover grammar

[17:10:19.0093] <shu>
though i'm more interested in how hard it is to implement in a recursive-descent parser anyhow

[17:10:44.0542] <shu>
i'll try to put time aside before plenary tomorrow to look, but... i also have a presentation tomorrow first thing so also no promises

[17:14:04.0630] <rbuckton>
The gist of it is, the cover is identical to AwaitExpression, but UnaryExpression would fail to parse `await using x` when `x` is on the same line.  AwaitUsingDeclaration however would be able to consume the cover along with a trailing `[no LineTerminator here] BindingList`, which seems pretty much equivalent to CoverParenthesizedExpression

that... sounds reasonable

[17:16:27.0551] <rbuckton>
Though I'll admit, cover grammars in the spec today sometimes seem a bit hand-wavy in a couple places.

[17:16:53.0700] <shu>
and i just do a bounded look ahead `await` `using` and see if it's an NLTH identifier

[17:17:07.0341] <shu>
in +Await contexts

[17:17:20.0856] <rbuckton>
In TS I'd just do two-token lookahead in +Await

[17:17:53.0906] <rbuckton>
That is one benefit of `await using` over `async using`. For `await using`, both uses of the cover are in +Await, while for `async using`, only one is.

[17:18:56.0079] <shu>
and `await using` without a binding list is unaffected?

[17:19:19.0664] <shu>
well, is supposed to be, according to the cover

[17:19:43.0601] <rbuckton>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> In TS I'd just do two-token lookahead in +Await

In fact, I've already done that in my current work on `using` (I was experimenting with all three syntax options).

[17:20:02.0874] <shu>
is TS a hand-written recursive-descent?

[17:22:03.0809] <rbuckton>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> and `await using` without a binding list is unaffected?

I'm not sure what you mean by this. `await using` on its own, or anywhere else legal for a UnaryExpression, should end up treated as an AwaitExpression.

[17:22:15.0127] <shu>
 yes, that is what i meant

[17:25:06.0574] <rbuckton>
From my understanding of cover grammars, we would eagerly parse CoverAwaitExpressionAndAwaitUsingDeclarationHead, but fail to parse the rest of ExpressionStatement. We could then retry the parse as part of AwaitUsingDeclaration, reusing the cover, and be able to successfully continue to parse. Then static semantics kick in and validate that the CoverAwaitExpressionAndAwaitUsingDeclarationHead is a valid AwaitUsingDeclarationHead (e.g., `await [NLT] using`), and parse the remainder of the statement (e.g., ``[NLT] BindingList `;` ``)

note the changes would need to be more substantive for dealing with [`v`-mode](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2418), which has a wider set of reserved punctuators and semantics for doubled punctuators (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-v-flag#how-is-the-v-flag-different-from-the-u-flag and https://arai-a.github.io/ecma262-compare/snapshot.html?pr=2418#prod-ClassSetCharacter )

[07:42:52.0841] <rbuckton>
Are we ensuring that RegExp.escape is future proof against potential new syntax? Should we be concerned if the output changes in a later version if we have to escape something new? We could choose to be intentionally over-aggressive with escapes, if we're not already. 

[07:53:27.0434] <rbuckton>
Also, rather than extending u-mode to allow other escapes, we could escape non-u-mode syntax characters using a hexadecimal representation that is legal in all modes. So, instead of adding `\-`, we could choose to escape it as `\x2d`. Same for `\=` (`\x3d`) and `\,` (`\x2c`)

[07:53:56.0876] <rbuckton>
I'm not saying we shouldn't extend u-mode, but this is an option if we decide not to.

[08:12:08.0586] <rbuckton>
Regarding the "exhaustive list of contexts", keep in mind that several proposals add other contexts:
- Modifiers: `(?imsx-imsx:...)`
- Comments: `(?#...)`
- `x`-mode line comments: `# ...`
- Atomic Groups: `(?>...)`

At a quick glance, I think this means that `#` may need to be escaped as well, lest it me misinterpreted in `x` mode.

[08:14:56.0862] <rbuckton>
If there's a chance we want `RegExp.escape` to always remain stable, it may be worth going over the RegExp syntax investigation I did at https://rbuckton.github.io/regexp-features/features/ to ensure we're future-proof against other syntax we may choose to adopt later. Though, I admit that's not a completely exhaustive list.

The changes are just a matter of including the punctuators which have meaning (or are reserved) in v-mode; the doubled punctuators don't actually end up mattering as long as the non-doubled versions are all escaped

[08:25:18.0841] <bakkot>

For example, we may never do recursive matching, but it still might be a good idea to escape `&` (used in `(?&name)` for recursive named capture group matching, and `(?(R&name)A|B)` in conditionals to test for recursion of a group).

[08:30:08.0963] <rbuckton>
Plus that list doesn't match the explainer currently, so there doesn't seem to be a definitive source of truth. Maybe that's a stage 2 concern, but if the point of the slides is "RegExp.escape is safe", then its important to clarify how safe.

[08:44:05.0170] <eemeli>
Presumably it's sufficient to guarantee that `RegExp.escape()` safe for its own `RegExp`, rather than being safe forever.

[08:45:35.0944] <bakkot>
Well, that depends on whether anyone starts depending on it _not_ escaping certain things

[08:51:00.0465] <bakkot>
rbuckton: Updated the slides to list proposed contexts as well, and went through all the ones you listed in your research doc as well

[08:51:36.0449] <bakkot>
I'm kinda tempted to just say it escapes _every_ ascii punctuator except `_`, since I've listed I think all of them except the two quotes and backtick at this point

[08:51:49.0340] <bakkot>
I did also update it to include line terminators for `x`-mode line comments

[08:52:05.0147] <bakkot>
 * I did also update it to include line terminators so you can't break out of `x`-mode line comments, which is something I'd previously neglected

[08:53:09.0756] <rbuckton>
That's why I posed the questions earlier. Do we need to ensure `RegExp.escape()` is consistent for all time? If so, do we do that my making a best guess as to what potential syntax characters we might encounter in the future, and will that limit us in terms of what new syntax we can add? Or do we aggressively escape anything that is not alpha-numeric (or equivalent unicode characters)?

[08:54:18.0633] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> I'm kinda tempted to just say it escapes _every_ ascii punctuator except `_`, since I've listed I think all of them except the two quotes and backtick at this point

I think that may be safer, though `_` might even be worth escaping since it has meaning as part of some control verbs in Perl.

[08:54:39.0255] <bakkot>
I think we should commit to not using `_` for anything ever

[08:54:57.0792] <bakkot>
v-mode had that discussion already when they decided not to include it in the double-punctuator reservations

[08:55:34.0337] <rbuckton>
Perl has `(*positive_lookahead: ... )`, for example

[08:56:18.0432] <bakkot>
ah, that seems more like it's being used as an identifier character, and doesn't need to be escaped any more than any other identifier character

[08:57:01.0762] <rbuckton>
PCRE also uses `` ` ``, `'`, `"`, and `%` for callouts.

[08:57:18.0921] <rbuckton>
I'm not sure we'll ever do callouts, but you can never be certain.

[08:57:52.0928] <bakkot>
ok I will just say every ascii punctuator

[08:57:55.0696] <bakkot>
except `_`

[08:58:12.0655] <bakkot>
And note that we might be able to make it less aggressive

That's fine with me.

re: future constraints, this does mean that we're committing that backslash + punctuator is only ever going to mean the punctuator, but that is I think a good limit to impose

[08:59:23.0921] <rbuckton>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> PCRE also uses `` ` ``, `'`, `"`, and `%` for callouts.

`'` is actually used quite a bit across RegExp engines, primarily as an alternative to `<>` for named capture groups.

> <@bakkot:matrix.org> re: future constraints, this does mean that we're committing that backslash + punctuator is only ever going to mean the punctuator, but that is I think a good limit to impose

As far as I can tell, no. The most likely engines that might have that would be Perl, PCRE, and Oniguruma, but I don't see anything like that so far.

[09:04:25.0214] <bakkot>
Sorry, by "no" do you mean "no one uses backslash + punctuator to mean anything other than the punctuator"?

[09:04:43.0397] <rbuckton>

Correct, though I'm still checking.

[09:05:11.0137] <rbuckton>
I think it would be safe to say that we also would never consider `\`+punctuator to mean anything other than the punctuator.

yeah, I was searching in all lists, but I was searching for "shared" and couldn't find it

[10:12:12.0839] <ljharb>
"fixed shape objects" is in the list

[10:12:24.0272] <ljharb>
that was what it was presented as when it got stage 1, i assume

heh I guess this is more generally intelligible if you replace "isolate" with "garbage collected heap"

> <@ljharb:matrix.org> at stage 1 the proposal name should describe the problem, and "shared structs" seems like a solution to me

I think we can afford champions some flexibility here, but Shu is clearly referring to this proposal as "shared structs" so it's fine to go with that.

[10:15:48.0967] <ljharb>
fair enough

[10:17:15.0699] <Chris de Almeida>
I think it's reasonable to expect better parity between the title in the tc39/proposals repo and the title on the proposal repo itself

[10:17:20.0678] <littledan>
Note: I believe Shu is using the term "closed" in a mathematical sense, about how these graphs don't point to each other.

[10:18:58.0493] <littledan>
and "mutators" refers to the executing code (which mutates the heap--even if it's purely functional)

[10:27:09.0551] <ljharb>
i usually default to whatever's on the agenda at advancement time in the proposals table

[10:27:18.0579] <ljharb>
but i agree that it would be nice if champions kept that in sync :-)

[10:48:01.0551] <Luca Casonato>
shu: The origin isolation is not really an issue for us in Deno, because our security model ensures that only a single tenant can execute code within a single process. Essentially the effect of cross origin isolation is the default for us. There are some server side runtimes, notably Cloudflare Workers, that run multiple tenants within a single process. They disallow all high precision timers and shared memory entirely.

[10:52:27.0362] <Andreu Botella>
can't you treat a reference to a SAB from inside a shared struct as if it was a per-isolate SAB object

[10:52:43.0055] <Andreu Botella>
separate from any other SAB object pointing to the same backing store in the same isolate

[10:53:42.0012] <Andreu Botella>
 * different from any other SAB object pointing to the same backing store in the same isolate

[10:56:35.0336] <Luca Casonato>
Technically probably possible - the identity continuity seems pretty hard (but probably possible). I think the biggest problem is wether this _should_ work, because magic object cloning is not something we have right now. Also what if you have a custom class that extends SAB?

[10:57:36.0581] <Andreu Botella>
Is there a need for identity continuity? You can currently clone a SAB without identity continuity with `structuredClone(sab)`

[10:57:43.0606] <Andreu Botella>
But I guess it would be needed for some use cases

[10:57:59.0008] <Andreu Botella>
 * Is there a need for identity continuity? You can currently clone a SAB without identity continuity with HTML's `structuredClone(sab)`

[10:58:23.0731] <Luca Casonato>
Yes, but there you have an explicit transfer

[10:58:42.0106] <Andreu Botella>
Oh, right, this would be an assignment transforming into a clone behind the scenes

[10:58:45.0082] <Luca Casonato>
With shared structs, assignment is transfer/publish, which means there is no explicit action a user needs ot to take

[10:59:08.0377] <Luca Casonato>
 * With shared structs, assignment is transfer/publish, which means there is no explicit call that needs to be made to transfer

[11:12:35.0140] <shu>
Andreu Botella: you can't make assignment a hidden clone anyway, because you need to clone it into a particular target realm, and a shared struct assignment is more like a broadcasrt

[11:12:39.0199] <shu>
 * Andreu Botella: you can't make assignment a hidden clone anyway, because you need to clone it into a particular target realm, and a shared struct assignment is more like a broadcast

[11:14:10.0508] <Andreu Botella>
you'd also want `struct.sab === struct.sab`, and that would require an extra per-isolate map

[11:15:38.0997] <shu>
yeah

[11:16:22.0825] <Luca Casonato>
You could make the assigment assign the SAB backing store into the shared struct, and then make the property access on the SAB create the JS object on demand - but that sounds slow and ugly and likely difficult to integrate

[11:16:56.0177] <Luca Casonato>
But yeah, to fix identity discontinuity you'd need a backing store -> js object map per isolate

[11:18:55.0707] <shu>
i think the DX of SAB objects themselves just don't matter

[11:19:03.0651] <shu>
since you can only use them via TA objects

[11:19:16.0334] <shu>
so to introduce a new kind of SAB object that can be put into shared structs seems the simplest solution to me

[11:20:16.0084] <littledan>
> <@lucacasonato:matrix.org> You could make the assigment assign the SAB backing store into the shared struct, and then make the property access on the SAB create the JS object on demand - but that sounds slow and ugly and likely difficult to integrate

the inability of SAB to point to JS values (with cycle collection) is a fundamental limitation. This is why I like how shared structs do *not* include the ability to be backed by SABs--it would be a completely different thing.

I don't understand. My comment was about engine internal code, not user code.

[11:22:27.0323] <littledan>
oh sorry I was going on a random tangent because I misunderstood

[11:24:50.0597] <rbuckton>
mark: re `yield`. I'm not sure what the champion's position is on this, but I think my preference is that context _isn't_ preserved. If it isn't preserved, there's an opportunity for a userland runtime to set context when calling `.next()`, which could be useful for something like a dataflow library. 

[11:25:42.0643] <bakkot>
(I have the opposite preference - `yield` should not be meaningfully different than `await` here)

[11:25:56.0140] <rbuckton>
`yield` is meaningly different from `await` though.

[11:26:02.0772] <bakkot>
Not for the purposes of this API

[11:26:24.0451] <HE Shi-Jun>
Both sides seems reasonable 😂

[11:26:28.0429] <bakkot>
In both cases the syntax is creating a continuation callback to be called at a future point, and that continuation should capture the current state

[11:26:54.0335] <littledan>
it would probably be helpful to look into the experience in Node.js, where this feature has long existed *without* such support in yield. Has this led to bugs? We should be able to find out.

No one uses yield so it doesn't come up

[11:27:24.0834] <littledan>

shouldn't this show up in generators all the time?

[11:27:57.0310] <bakkot>
no one uses generators either

[11:28:00.0154] <rbuckton>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> shouldn't this show up in generators all the time?

I'd expect a lot of generators run to completion synchronously, so it wouldn't be observable.

[11:28:41.0942] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> no one uses generators either

no one is far too strong. TypeScript uses them internally, and there are userland runtimes that rely on them.

[11:28:53.0286] <bakkot>
that's an exaggeration of course, but yeah like Ron says most uses of generators IME are simple enough that it doesn't end up being relevant. to see this in real life you have to do the `next` call on a subsequent turn

[11:28:55.0671] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> no one uses generators either

 * "no one" is far too strong. TypeScript uses them internally, and there are userland runtimes that rely on them.

dumb question: there is no chance that "context" will be confused with the decorators context? Asking because I just heard context so many times and got reminded that it can be kind of meaningless because it can mean anything. Totally not a blocking concern but wondering if anyone else had the same thought

[11:30:12.0585] <rbuckton>
If `yield` _did_ preserve context, I'd argue we need a mechanism to turn this off on an as-need basis otherwise we'd block a number of valid use cases.

[11:30:35.0137] <ljharb>
are beginner devs using node's async stuff now?

Yeah it'd be great to have a name brainstorm here (in an issue, not during plenary). https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context/issues

[11:31:45.0088] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> I would be OK with a `yield.nocontext` or something I guess

That's the problem. In the cases I'm concerned with, the generator is provided by the user to a third party library. You want the library to handle the complexities involved with async context flow control, not the author of the genrator. You want them to not be concerned about choosing which `yield` variant to use.

[11:32:14.0924] <yulia>
i don't have a concrete alternative and context isn't horrible. I don't know if the collision would really take place, just hadn't thought about it

[11:32:26.0094] <rbuckton>
A number of languages with an `AsyncContext`-like mechanism also have some mechanism of explicitly affecting async flow control.

[11:32:26.0698] <yulia>
i'll make an issue

[11:32:31.0247] <littledan>
The thing is, an AsyncContext instance is more like a single *variable*

[11:32:38.0219] <HE Shi-Jun>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> I would be OK with a `yield.nocontext` or something I guess

`yield.foo` will have diff semantic out of generator, don't like such syntax :P

[11:33:10.0089] <rbuckton>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> A number of languages with an `AsyncContext`-like mechanism also have some mechanism of explicitly affecting async flow control.

See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.asyncflowcontrol?view=net-8.0, for example.

[11:34:18.0610] <bakkot>
hm. I'll have to think more about `yield`.

[11:34:25.0754] <bakkot>

[11:34:32.0235] <rbuckton>

.NET calls this an `AsyncLocal<T>`, though that is backed by something called a "Call Context"

[11:37:52.0715] <ljharb>
tbh "context" is a better name for this proposal than for the decorator property

[11:38:02.0099] <ljharb>
 * tbh "context" is a better name for this proposal than for the decorator property, if we had to pick one

[11:39:16.0069] <yulia>
thats fair, up until today i was taking AsyncContext as a name for granted

[11:39:34.0747] <littledan>
let's call it "util"

[11:39:41.0713] <yulia>

AsyncUtil

[11:40:11.0880] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
the meaning of "context" is highly context-dependent, unfortunately

[11:40:14.0328] <rbuckton>
`context` is a general purpose term, I'd hate for us to relegate it to a single purpose.

[11:40:43.0492] <shu>
apaprocki: i believe you but BBG is a closed-shop ecosystem, so i wouldn't weigh it too much as predictive of ecosystem integration pains for JS at large

[11:41:31.0031] <apaprocki>

eemeli: pretty sure it's not polyfillable

[11:52:23.0216] <bakkot>

You want the library to handle the complexities involved with async context flow control, not the author of the genrator. You want them to not be concerned about choosing which `yield` variant to use.

so, "the generator is provided by the user to a third party library" seems like exactly the case where we want `yield` to preserve state. taking the example from the readme:

```js
  libraryTakingAnIterator(context.run('id', function* () {
    log('starting');

    yield 0;

    // if the library `await`s before resuming, we've lost our id
    log('done');
  }));
```
Maybe we should say that any library which consumes iterators in this way needs to juggle contexts properly? but on the other hand it's not clear to me how that's even possible here - how would the library ensure that the second half of the generator runs in the correct context?

[11:52:48.0003] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
you could wrap `Generator.prototype.next`

[11:53:15.0428] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
 * strawdog idea: you could wrap `Generator.prototype.next`

[11:53:17.0404] <bakkot>
but how does the library it get the original context?

[11:53:17.0882] <littledan>
when the queue opens back up, please feel free to ask questions about AsyncContext, even much more basic ones, about how it works at all.

[11:53:19.0701] <rbuckton>
I'd expect, at least roughly, that the context value remains referenced until `run`'s callstack is exhausted and any `Promise` created is garbage collected.

[11:53:20.0958] <bakkot>
 * but how does the library get the original context?

Hmm. that example feels odd to me, since execution for the generator doesn't actually start until you call `.next()`. That said, I'm fine if context propagates over `yield` if we have a mechanism to affect async flow control.

i would like the conversation to come back to what littledan was proposing on "whether we want this feature"

[12:04:20.0530] <shu>
all these details beg the question of our already having consensus on that

[12:04:31.0965] <bakkot>

[12:04:39.0725] <bakkot>
this is a big complex thing

[12:04:49.0954] <bakkot>
so I want to see it being useful for a bunch of things

[12:05:00.0615] <bakkot>
and I trust justin that it is useful for all the enumerated things, but I can't visualize how yet

[12:05:16.0388] <littledan>
Chengzhong Wugave a good presentation in WebPerfWG about this

[12:05:17.0818] <rbuckton>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> Hmm. that example feels odd to me, since execution for the generator doesn't actually start until you call `.next()`. That said, I'm fine if context propagates over `yield` if we have a mechanism to affect async flow control.

Actually, if `yield` propagates context then I'm not even sure a flow-control mechanism would help, since flow control would probably only affect entry to the generator, not reentry via `next()`.

[12:05:30.0966] <littledan>
Maybe next meeting, this can be given to TC39 again

[12:07:16.0539] <Lenz Weber-Tronic (phryneas)>
bakkot the most pressing issue I can think of at this time is in servers, where functions need to access stuff related to the current request. At this point it's an absolute pain of passing the current request context down and down and down in method arguments, and it's easily lost.

[12:07:59.0716] <Lenz Weber-Tronic (phryneas)>
node has `AsyncLocalStorage` for that, but any framework that wants to support more platforms than that is at a loss at this time.

[12:09:10.0342] <bakkot>
Lenz Weber-Tronic (phryneas): I believe you but I need to see it written out

[12:09:17.0286] <justinfagnani>
there's both a question why it's useful, but why it's valuable as a language feature (which is the inability of userland code to correctly wrap all closure-storing APIs or intercept `await`)

[12:09:24.0082] <rbuckton>
bakkot: I've used to thread request context information for web requests, such as the current authenticated user, request message, etc. Similar to `HttpContext.Current` in .NET (which uses the same mechanisms)

[12:11:12.0678] <Lenz Weber-Tronic (phryneas)>
bakkot how exactly would "written out" look in this case? Just trying to figure out how to best give you the example.
Imagine you have a call stack that is 50 calls deep. Either you have a `, context` argument in every of those functions, or the one function at depth 50 can call `getCurrentRequest()` which wraps `requestContext.get()`

[12:11:38.0105] <danielrosenwasser>
I very much don't have expertise to weigh in on this API, so I can just give trust that in the current direction; but it sounds like the feature works "in the abstract". I wish there was a prototype so that we could have a sample in which it could be demonstrated:

* "now let's add logging"
* "now let's add ..."

and see how that composes in practice. And I'm fine with discussing that in stage 2.

You could survey usage of Node's API for example code, since it essentially provides the same functionality

[12:13:14.0030] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> littledan: it can't be just "welcome", i'm asking how andreu plans to "see performance"?

OK, well, yeah, this is a reasonable requirement, and we should look into it. Keeping performance good is a goal as Justin has repeatedly said. Bloomberg is sponsoring Igalia's involvement in implementation work.

[12:13:30.0238] <littledan>
and yeah the burden should be on us to prove that it's good.

[12:13:36.0783] <Andreu Botella>
Yeah, we'll be looking into that. We don't yet have any benchmarks in mind, but this is still very early on

[12:13:50.0768] <Andreu Botella>
like, we were literally discussing this earlier today

[12:13:54.0099] <Lenz Weber-Tronic (phryneas)>
bakkot it does exist, in some form, in node

An example would be the NextJs `headers` function. This functionality would not be able at all in React-land without this API:
https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/headers

[12:13:57.0206] <shu>
it doesn't have to be a real benchmark

[12:14:04.0762] <shu>
i'm just wondering how you plan to verify anything

[12:14:12.0795] <shu>
(not being flippant if i sounded that way)

[12:14:31.0416] <Chengzhong Wu>
In Node.js we have several micro-benchmarks that we can port to AsyncContext: https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/main/benchmark/async_hooks

[12:15:45.0329] <Chengzhong Wu>
And we can adopt OpenTelemetry's real world use cases for benchmarking if needed.

[12:15:54.0246] <shu>
sorry let me be clearer

[12:16:08.0495] <shu>
the performance concern is that AsyncContext _itself_ will be too slow

[12:16:11.0633] <shu>
it's fine for new features to be slow

[12:16:31.0376] <shu>
the way this feature must be implemented is In The Deep at the engine level

[12:16:39.0584] <shu>
which means it affects performance of _all_ executions even if they don't use the feature

[12:17:02.0887] <shu>
i would like to see things that suggest that this feature can in fact be pay-as-you-go (or close to it), and executions that don't use the feature don't suffer performance regressions

V8 is already saving/restoring the `v8::Context::{Get,Set}ContinuationPreservedEmbedderData` today, which is close to what this proposal needs

[12:17:54.0615] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
I know!

[12:18:25.0313] <littledan>
Yeah, it will be a clear requirement that this doesn't slow down V8. We can the existing public V8 benchmarks to verify (and I know you have CI that will also verify this after it lands).

[12:18:30.0414] <shu>
but that thing is set by the embedder in a very bounded way, in a way that V8 folks aren't 100% happy with anyway

As long as we don't call this `AsyncLocalStorage`, which is AsyncLocal-Storage and not Async-LocalStorage.      

[12:21:27.0505] <HE Shi-Jun>
I still like `AsyncLocal` which make the analog to `ThreadLocal` in other langauges.

We don't have notes of current topic?

[12:22:07.0228] <Justin Ridgewell>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> so, "the generator is provided by the user to a third party library" seems like exactly the case where we want `yield` to preserve state. taking the example from the readme:
> 
> ```js
>   libraryTakingAnIterator(context.run('id', function* () {
>     log('starting');
> 
>     yield 0;
> 
>     // if the library `await`s before resuming, we've lost our id
>     log('done');
>   }));
> ```
> Maybe we should say that any library which consumes iterators in this way needs to juggle contexts properly? but on the other hand it's not clear to me how that's even possible here - how would the library ensure that the second half of the generator runs in the correct context?

I think the more natural is to do `context.run(libraryTakingAnIterator(…))`, in which case both call and init time would be equivalent

[12:22:08.0267] <Andreu Botella>
An "async context" in common parlance would seem to refer to the entire async-local map, rather than to an entry

[12:22:17.0317] <Andreu Botella>
so there's also that

[12:22:34.0156] <Justin Ridgewell>

waldemar: so, re: the C++ release fence. in short, you are correct that in the C++ memory model the release fence doesn't sync-with without a corresponding acquire operation on another thread.

the way V8 (and JVM) reason about this i think is more at the ISA level, per ISA. like, we think a store-store fence (`dmb` on ARM) or whatever is sufficient to publish. we need to ensure no store-store reorderings happen at both the codegen level and the CPU level.

the `dmb` guarantees that at the CPU level. a release fence seems to guarantee that at the codegen level, but strictly speaking may be incorrect.

maybe manual inline assembly is better here? idk


[12:45:22.0982] <shu>
in any case V8 mixes C++ generated code and our own generated code liberally anyway, since it's a JIT

[12:45:34.0218] <shu>
and i've never wrapped my head around reasoning at the C++ memory model level

[12:45:39.0435] <shu>
because of course taht doesn't exist for our own generated code

[12:45:57.0836] <shu>
so i generally try to reason about it by divining what ARM guarantees, then trying to shape C++ to generate the right thing

[12:46:15.0357] <shu>
(or what x86 guarantees etc)

[12:47:19.0050] <shu>
in fact, V8 also does the even more un-specified thing around atomics where we just bitcast addresses to `std::atomic`s

[12:47:24.0346] <shu>
but i think that behavior may finally be getting specced?

that abseil thing exactly characterizes where the interop argument falls down when you tug on the chain

I think interop where there's no standard is the kind of case where you can choose a preponderance-of-the-evidence kind of thing. ns is "good enough" in this sense. That doesn't make it a reductio-ad-absurdum

[13:34:27.0916] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> v8's position is there is no good reason, and certainly not on the web

I think half-microseconds aren't really that implausible to be relevant. Anyway there are lots of times where you're *processing* date/times without measuring them locally.

[13:34:55.0355] <shu>
the philosophical objection is actually stronger than than "there might be uses"

[13:35:15.0326] <shu>
it's "where you think you should be using nanoseconds, you are fooling yourself with the extra precision, with very few exceptions"

[13:35:30.0265] <littledan>

i don't understand this argument, you and others have repeatedly brought this up. why... are people shoehorning everything that represents time into Temporal data types?

[13:37:02.0710] <shu>
like ns timestamps don't need the extra complexity of tepmoral

[13:37:08.0784] <shu>
sometimes it's formatting

[13:37:12.0198] <shu>
which... is a different thing?

[13:37:25.0789] <shu>
 * like ns timestamps don't need the extra complexity of temporal

[13:37:38.0333] <apaprocki>
because you are generically binding to typed database tables or schemas for services, etc. it's a giant foot gun if developers can't take a duration from Postgres and represent it as a duration in js without loss

[13:37:59.0524] <apaprocki>
somehow knowing they need to *not* use the built-in type and use a string or unrelated type.. it's extremely not ergonomic

They seem kinda cool but I really want function decorators and, separately, extractors/pattern matching, which are kind of in adjacent spaces. Probably all of this eventually; I don't know how to prioritize.

[14:19:38.0146] <ljharb>

I do have to admit that, with decorators evaluated at class evaluation time, they are sort of a better fit than extractors/pattern matching evaluated each time the function runs.

Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't really be a fan of some of the decorators used in this presentation

[14:26:16.0743] <HE Shi-Jun>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> and?

And I think it's reasonable to have param decorators, function decorators, etc. if we support class decorators...

[14:26:21.0154] <Chris de Almeida>
fair

[14:27:20.0530] <shu>
what is the argument for it?

[14:27:27.0255] <shu>
"people ask for it" is usually not sufficient

[14:28:19.0216] <ljharb>
JS also is in a position where a ton of people come to it from different languages, and they write lots of code that matches the idioms of their source langs that does NOT match JS idiom

[14:28:31.0205] <ljharb>
ie the "java devs write java in every language" sentiment

`ImplImplImplImplBuilderImpl`

[14:29:00.0311] <ljharb>
excessive nouns, indeed

[14:29:24.0240] <apaprocki>
I'd say something like "it allows you to easily reuse code that would otherwise be repeated (boilerplate), or, more importantly, *omitted* because the author doesn't want to bother due to the size of the boilerplate"

[14:29:33.0563] <apaprocki>
for things like standard parameter validation checks across a large codebase

[14:29:55.0202] <ljharb>
validation checks i 100% agree - that's not the same thing as the extensive metaprogramming demonstrated in the preso

[14:29:56.0784] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> JS also is in a position where a ton of people come to it from different languages, and they write lots of code that matches the idioms of their source langs that does NOT match JS idiom

Another way to frame this would be, "The culture of how people write JS is diverse and influenced by other programming languages' culture"

[14:30:05.0426] <bakkot>
`valid(x)` is almost exactly the same amount of code as `@valid`, and as a bonus also works with destructured parameters

[14:30:11.0724] <ljharb>
sure. it's just not necessarily influenced for the better.

[14:30:30.0562] <Ashley Claymore>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> I do have to admit that, with decorators evaluated at class evaluation time, they are sort of a better fit than extractors/pattern matching evaluated each time the function runs.

the function returned by the decorator does run each time, so a bit like a cached extractor

well, people had 10 years to come up with stuff, the presentation is just showing what people are already doing - and I guess showing the obvious and boring would not make a good case that it is a flexible tool, right? :)

[14:30:55.0609] <Chris de Almeida>

I mean I think DI is a very divisive programming technique? but IMO we should separate "this proposal would enable X footgun" and "this proposal would enable X programming technique that I don't like"

[14:40:21.0425] <bakkot>
the latter is also a valid reason to not add something though

[14:40:56.0816] <bakkot>
e.g., there are languages where constructing code at runtime and evaluating it is a core technique

[14:41:02.0245] <Chris de Almeida>
I do not miss the era of DI being the new shiny

[14:41:35.0514] <bakkot>

I think bakkot's point is also spot on. Java has an overuse of classes for **everything**, and this is shoehorning a bunch into functionality into classes because we want it to be class method param decorators

[14:44:59.0384] <Justin Ridgewell>
I'm not blocking, but god I hope I never have to work on a codebase that uses this style.

> <@bakkot:matrix.org> but I don't want people to use that technique in JS and would actively oppose features which enabled it (though, of course, that ship has sailed)

I'd say there are frameworks heavily based on that, and also frameworks for the same purpose not using this at all. You probably won't get happy working in a team that loves using these techniques, but that team would find ways of doing so either way - so why not make it easier for them? It will not eradicate the option of working without these features.

[14:47:59.0379] <ljharb>
btw for function decorators can we just decide that decorated function declarations aren't hoisted? or is it more complex than that

that would be extremely weirdf

Oh, sorry, I missed the first sentence of that message and assumed you still were talking about the current proposal.

[14:53:53.0447] <bakkot>
yeah, the point was that sometimes features enable you to do things that we, as language designers, don't want to encourage you to do. that is how I feel about this style of DI.

[14:59:56.0274] <msaboff>
TypeScript ≠ JavaScript.  They don't need to be the same.  I think that would be a false goal of the committee.  They serve different purposes.  Developers choose various tools and language extensions in solve their problems.

[15:02:07.0717] <shu>

Luckily, there are only two TS features that are not JS features, decorators being one of them - so that's not a long-term concern :)

[15:12:08.0347] <msaboff>
Maybe I'm pushing back an a theme that seems to be prevalent during this meeting, and that is JS should unify the related ecosystems.  I think that is the wrong target.  We need to be about craeful evolution of the JS language and ensuring compatibility among the various implementations.

That requires saying NO to some proposals for a variety of valid reasons.

> <@ljharb:matrix.org> something i *do* want is the ability to mark constructor arguments as automatically stored in a public, or private, field. but that could be done potentially with a class decorator, i suppose

I've experimented with this. Its easy to do on a simple class, but much harder to support an inherited class without injecting a function in between the super and subclass to perform initialization after `super()`. 

[15:19:00.0138] <HE Shi-Jun>

again by "that ship has sailed" I meant that we had `eval`

[15:20:45.0682] <bakkot>
but that said, in exactly the same way, I don't want us to add new ways to make it easier to have `eval`

[15:21:10.0838] <bakkot>

> <@aclaymore:matrix.org> the function returned by the decorator does run each time, so a bit like a cached extractor

This was going to be my point about the potential of parameter decorators to maybe have better performance than `assert`, since the conditions expressed in the decorator are cached for every call, as opposed to needing to be reevaluated each time. 
They are also simpler, since you can reference the parameter name from `context`, rather than duplicate it in an `assert`:

```js

[15:22:59.0319] <ljharb>

Decorators are ultimately about targeted/declarative meta-programming. Without them we'd have no way to ergonomically metaprogram over class fields (and before `accessor` no way at all). Is it not in scope to metaprogram in a similar way over parameters?

It's "in scope" in the sense that you can argue for it, certainly? But I don't think it's "in scope" in the sense that having one implies we must have the other.

Isn't the `BooksAPI` example a really clear example of that?

[15:29:42.0302] <bakkot>
There's no reason to make that a class at all except that it's the only way you can get parameter decorators

[15:29:54.0531] <Justin Ridgewell>
I think the code samples in the slides demonstrated it already?

[15:29:55.0553] <bakkot>
In any other context those functions would be separate functions

[15:30:17.0661] <rbuckton>

[15:30:39.0603] <shu>
> <@justinfagnani:matrix.org> tagged template literals sailed too!

the ability to embed a language between some quotes isn't also the same treatment that languages that care about DSLs give to DSLs. agreed in the abstract but pretty different in degree imo

[15:30:53.0591] <justinfagnani>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> what do you mean by metaprogramming? those constructs you listed are not metaprogramming

being able to introspect objects and dynamically manipulate them is in the realm of metaprogramming for many languages where objects aren't maps. In other languages doing that would specifically require using a reflection API.

[15:30:58.0034] <littledan>
Sorry for causing delay!

> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> if you are reflecting data as data, i don't consider that metaprogramming

I think it's reasonable to consider object field names "code"

[15:33:34.0457] <shu>
disagree

[15:33:42.0096] <shu>
i don't think it's reasonable to consider strings code?

[15:33:42.0334] <ljharb>
i also disagree

[15:34:02.0603] <littledan>
I mean, they are code in other languages

[15:34:14.0301] <shu>
what does that mean?

[15:34:17.0842] <shu>
you can jump to a string?

[15:34:49.0697] <littledan>
well, just accessing a field by name in C++ is a fragment of code, and the kind of stuff you can do with `[]` in JS would be "reflection"

[15:35:08.0674] <shu>
i am very confused

[15:35:18.0653] <littledan>
anyway this is philosophy and not relevant to any decision we have here

[15:35:26.0494] <ptomato>
I guess in that there is no way to do this in C++?
```c++
struct S {
  int a;

[15:36:00.0111] <ptomato>
 * I guess in that there is no way to do this in C++?

```c++
struct S {
  int a;
  int b;
};
S s = new S();
const char *fieldname = "a";
s->[fieldname] = 5;
```

[15:36:05.0631] <justinfagnani>
in many languages a utility to replace a method would have to use metaprogramming, in JS you can patch a prototype - same goal, different mechanism. I think it's still metaprogramming.

[15:36:21.0952] <ptomato>
 * I guess in that there is no way to do this in C++?

```c++
struct S {
  int a;
  int b;
};
S* s = new S();
const char *fieldname = "a";
s->[fieldname] = 5;
```

[15:36:23.0063] <shu>
okay, then my apologies for using too imprecise a term

exactly, whereas you can do this with some kind of Java "reflection" API I think

[15:37:18.0933] <shu>
i am specifically against evolving JS to enable more facilities to reflect code as data in order to manipulate that data, and to evaluate the manipulated new data as code

[15:37:29.0776] <shu>
a space that i consider decorators to be in generally, thus the desire to restrict them

[15:37:55.0035] <ptomato>
although, now that I think of it, you _can_ do it in C++ with `offsetof` and/or template parameters

[15:38:05.0692] <justinfagnani>
> and to evaluate the manipulated new data as code

this isn't part of the proposals though, right?

[15:38:16.0786] <apaprocki>
> <@pchimento:igalia.com> although, now that I think of it, you _can_ do it in C++ with `offsetof` and/or template parameters

or using a map from string -> pointer

[15:38:41.0786] <bakkot>
justinfagnani: e.g. the proposal in its current form exposes the names of parameters, which thus far are purely code rather than data except in terms of f.p.toString

not anymore it isn't, the bag of descriptors thing kinda had that feel

[15:38:49.0998] <justinfagnani>
if it helps to use "reflection" instead of "metaprogramming", to indicate there are no new facilities for evaluating data as code, then ok

[15:39:35.0832] <ljharb>
code as data?

[15:40:08.0126] <shu>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> justinfagnani: e.g. the proposal in its current form exposes the names of parameters, which thus far are purely code rather than data except in terms of f.p.toString

precisely this. currently you can alpha-convert (or de bruijn index-ize) parameters, if there's no presence of direct eval

[15:40:11.0437] <shu>
decorators prevents this

[15:40:18.0415] <justinfagnani>
I meant "data as code" referring to Shu's objection

[15:40:49.0763] <shu>
i think jordan is just saying you reversed the direction

[15:40:59.0501] <justinfagnani>
I did?

[15:41:19.0250] <justinfagnani>
you oppose reflecting on code as data, then using evaluating that data  as new code

[15:41:20.0495] <ljharb>
"evaluating code as data" is the Bad Thing

[15:41:20.0836] <justinfagnani>
yes?

[15:41:39.0363] <shu>
oh sure, yes, there's a round trip

[15:41:54.0324] <justinfagnani>
right

[15:42:01.0323] <ljharb>
"evaluating data as code" is already eval, and separately we also want to avoid new forms of eval

[15:42:17.0212] <shu>
so thanks for pushing on this i guess i don't strictly mean a full round trip

[15:42:34.0396] <shu>
reifying code as data, then running code on that code-as-data and causing new behavior, also feels like a smell to me

[15:43:15.0852] <shu>
that's how i think of what underlies people not liking "hidden magic"

[15:44:22.0132] <bakkot>
yes for DI in particular

[15:44:43.0995] <bakkot>
like normally the answer to "how did these values get bound to these parameters" is "the caller passed them in, or they are the default values"

[15:44:54.0042] <bakkot>
after parameter decorators, the answer will be "it is literally not knowable'

[15:45:01.0799] <justinfagnani>
I don't use DI myself, but... this is also true in DI

[15:45:18.0088] <justinfagnani>
the DI container passes in the parameters through a normal ctor call

[15:45:32.0838] <ptomato>
I think of hidden magic much more broadly - for me it's anything where execution jumps to an entirely different place and it's not obvious from the code

[15:45:53.0260] <ptomato>
like accessor properties, operator overloading, ...

[15:46:01.0377] <bakkot>
the DI container is a maximally abstract central location for passing values to things

[15:46:18.0742] <bakkot>
"the values are passed by the DI container" doesn't tell you anything about how they got there

[15:47:29.0187] <bakkot>
similarly, if you (as I do) transform your whole program into a bespoke implemented-in-JS VM, and then the main loop of the VM does the dispatch for all function calls in the entire program, that's also "the values are passed by the callers" but it's completely impossible for readers to follow

[15:47:48.0184] <ptomato>
I don't necessarily want to stamp out hidden magic, I think it's great when used responsibly and in reasonable amounts, and I'd hesitate to pass a value judgement on others' codebases that might have different tradeoffs as to what they consider "reasonable"

[15:47:50.0144] <justinfagnani>
it's fine to not like that, but it's pretty analogous to higher-order-functions... those can absolutely be abused in nasty ways.

So many of us would prefer code bases that don't do that too much. But is it invalid as a whole?

[15:48:09.0543] <ptomato>
haha, I think I'm saying the same thing as justinfagnani here :-)

[15:48:11.0474] <bakkot>
I don't know what "invalid" means.

[15:48:21.0806] <bakkot>
Like it does... work? It's a legal program you can write in a language which allows it?

[15:48:41.0178] <bakkot>
But is it something the language should specifically set out to enable? That is a matter of opinion and my opinion is no, it should not.

[15:48:43.0496] <ljharb>

Without using macros there is no way I can think of to use the field names as string keys. But I've seen dark template magic that lets you take a class such as S and do generic introspection about its fields and their types, iterate through the fields, get the nth field and its type, etc.

Yup, the time zone situation in Lebanon is quite a mess at the moment: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/27/lebanon-in-two-different-time-zones-as-government-disagrees-on-daylight-savings.html

[18:50:45.0928] <justingrant>
It amazes me how governments—repeatedly—make last-minute changes to DST and then are shocked, just shocked, about the tech turmoil that inevitably ensues. Brazil in 2019 stopped using DST with only 6 months' notice, and that was still a mess. Countries really should be giving 2-3 years' heads up to allow updating all the software that was playing by the old time zone rules. IoT and mobile devices are particularly challenging because they often require OS or firmware updates to get new time zone rules, and many device vendors' support budgets are skimpy.

FWIW, `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`'s default behavior was designed to flag cases when parsing previously-stored data after time zone rules have unexpectedly changed. So a string like `2020-01-15T12:00:00-02:00[America/Sao_Paulo]` stores both the exact timestamp (what you'd store in a `Temporal.Instant`) as well as the time zone identifier America/Sao_Paulo. If you try to parse that string today (after we know about Brazil's stopping DST in 2019) using `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from`  then you'll get a RangeError because there's a conflict between the offset -02:00 and the time zone ID America/Sao_Paulo.

For developers who know what behavior they want in cases like that, there's an `offset` option that can be used to choose how to resolve conflicts. https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/zoneddatetime.html#from https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/ambiguity.html#examples-offset-option

This won't help cases like Lebanon's which have minimal (or negative!) advance notice, but should help developers find and recover from changes like Brazil's where changes are announced a few months in advance: long enough for IANA Time Zone Database updates to be rolled out into ECMAScript implementations.

an interesting observation about JSON.parse with source now that i'm trying to ship it

[16:35:54.0210] <shu>
adding a 3rd argument broke one existing test, which shows that the compatibility risk is not zero. to wit, it broke a test testing the reviver that logs every argument passed to the reviver

[16:36:45.0188] <shu>
things like enumerating and doing something with every argument seems to be much more likely for tests than in the wild code, but it is of course not impossible
