Is there a list of registrations anywhere? I'm pretty sure I registered a while ago, but not 100% certain

[07:23:41.0252] <Chris de Almeida>
you are registered

[07:37:32.0411] <Chengzhong Wu>
There should be a confirmation mail to your filled email inbox, like "Thanks for filling out this form: TC39 March 2026 In-Person Registration"

is there a preferred convention for single-line vs multi-line if statements in ecma262?

[09:50:06.0779] <ptomato>
> 1. If ? SomethingBad(_input_) is **true**, throw a **TypeError** exception.

vs

> 1. If ? SomethingBad(_input_) is **true**, then
>    a. Throw a **TypeError** exception.

[10:01:14.0158] <Michael Ficarra>
there's a bunch of guidelines in our editorial conventions: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/wiki/Editorial-Conventions#algorithm-conventions

what does this mean concretely? "if an early-exiting if/else has just two branches (i.e. not an if-else cascade like in some Math functions), and the two branches are substantially similar and short, prefer a single step"

[17:00:44.0339] <ptomato>
does it mean to prefer
> If Something(), return _thing_; else return _other_.

[17:01:05.0399] <ptomato>
over
> 1. If Something(), return _thing_.
> 2. Return _other_.
?

[17:01:08.0769] <ptomato>
* over

> 1. If Something(), return _thing_.
> 2. Return _other_.

?

[17:01:26.0396] <ptomato>
* does it mean to prefer

> 1. If Something(), return _thing_; else return _other_.

[17:02:00.0748] <bakkot>
yeah

[17:02:11.0764] <ptomato>
ok

[17:02:14.0585] <ptomato>
thanks

[17:02:21.0586] <ptomato>
but not this?


[17:02:37.0674] <ptomato>
> 1. If Something(), throw a **TypeError** exception; else return _thing_.

[17:02:45.0499] <ptomato>
because the two branches aren't substantially similar?

[17:03:00.0912] <bakkot>
"substantially similar" is always vibes, but personally I would write that as two steps for that reason, yes

[17:03:24.0222] <ptomato>
all right, got it. thanks

[10:07:06.0578] <ptomato>

[10:07:27.0174] <ptomato>

vs

[10:07:27.0780] <ptomato>
?

[10:09:20.0839] <ptomato>
both 402 and 262 use both, but the latter is more prevalent in 262 and vice versa

[10:16:29.0695] <Michael Ficarra>
I only see quoted occurrences in 262

[10:17:21.0637] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm searching for `column of Table` and see 14 occurrences

[10:20:11.0884] <ptomato>
in NumericToRawBytes there's "Let _conversionOperation_ be the abstract operation named in the Conversion Operation column in Table 70 for Element Type _type_."

[10:31:02.0465] <Michael Ficarra>
ah, we should fix that to use `column of Table` and quote the column name like the rest

[10:43:18.0269] <ptomato>
I think I also saw one instance of something like "column one of Table 777"

[10:47:03.0469] <Michael Ficarra>
I'd be very surprised if we referred to a column numerically in 262, but if we did, please open an issue.

[10:56:11.0529] <ptomato>
found it again, it's in CreateIntrinsics https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-createintrinsics

In Tokyo a few folks expressed an interest in discussing an Abort protocol compatible with AbortSignal, etc. I've added a discussion to the agenda for NYC to discuss and have started framing some thoughts around it here -- https://github.com/jasnell/discussion-abort-protocol ... these are just my initial thoughts around the general problem space. For folks who have an interest, we can use that repo for some pre-discussion. It's pre-proposal .. that is, i'm intentionally not trying to ask for a Stage 1 proposal yet as I think there are details we need to make sure there's alignment on before we advance to a proposal stage

I did investigate something similar in the cancellation protocol back as far as 2018: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-cancellation/issues/22

[16:25:44.0482] <James M Snell>
I've added an issue to remind me to revisit that https://github.com/jasnell/discussion-abort-protocol/issues/5

is there any existing preference for/against AOs that only have a single caller?

[13:45:24.0375] <ptomato>
I'm assuming the guidance is "use your judgement, inline it if the AO doesn't add anything to readability"
