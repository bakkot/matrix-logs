Hongbo is suggesting the iterator protocol has a high performance overhead (25x perf loss).  Do we know if this is cost is effectively mandated in the spec, or is this just a unfulfilled optimization opportunity in engines?

My hope is that engines could optimize Array iteration, but I'm not sure about other cases
