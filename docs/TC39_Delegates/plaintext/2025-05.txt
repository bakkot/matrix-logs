y'all what font is this

[22:10:31.0303] <Aki>
i cannot find that exact 9 in any font i've looked at

[00:12:29.0797] <snek>
i believe it is two fonts

[00:12:38.0504] <snek>
the "TC" is neutraface 

[00:12:46.0079] <snek>
idk what the 39 is

[00:38:06.0726] <snek>
that 39 really is a mystery i cannot find anything that matches it

[00:38:21.0904] <snek>
inb4 the 3 and 9 are separate fonts too

[00:38:38.0735] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Maybe the .ai file for the logo has some useful metadata?

[02:03:22.0935] <Jonas Kruckenberg>
it may also be a logo-specific modification of some other typeface 

[02:03:41.0307] <Jonas Kruckenberg>
the 9 looks kinda wonky in particular 

[07:44:31.0096] <Aki>
everything is curves even in the oldest file i can find

[07:54:35.0496] <ptomato>
the "39" looks like Roboto to me, although I checked what it looks like in unmodified Roboto and the 9 is indeed off

[07:55:50.0036] <Chris de Almeida>
looks like helvetica or a variant like helvetica neue for the numbers

[07:58:22.0124] <Chris de Almeida>
top helvetica, bottom helvetica neue

[07:59:18.0667] <Chris de Almeida>
hmm, no, they are quite similar but def different

[07:59:27.0071] <Chris de Almeida>
* hmm, no, they are quite similar to the logo but def different

[08:06:46.0760] <Chris de Almeida>
SYG should know, I think he created it

[09:12:58.0334] <shu>
i did

[09:12:59.0740] <shu>
let me see

[09:16:55.0902] <shu>
i... thought it was Neutraface Bold

[09:17:02.0462] <shu>
but i see that the 9 glyph is not that 9 glyph

[09:21:21.0426] <shu>
i have no memory of what font the 39 is in

[09:23:56.0819] <Ashley Claymore>
Looks like an upside down 6 to me, maybe you were feeling extra creative that day?

[09:28:57.0191] <shu>
it shouldn't be particularly obscure, i did not spend a lot of time on it

[09:29:29.0586] <shu>
i suppose i could've manually edited the path but i don't really remember

[09:37:37.0065] <shu>
okay i'm pretty sure it's Roboto Bold, but the current version looks slightly different

[09:38:00.0931] <shu>
if you look at this font: https://github.com/erinmclaughlin/Yantramanav

[09:38:12.0221] <shu>
which is a devangari font meant to match Roboto

[09:38:19.0993] <shu>
the '39' in that font matches pretty much exactly

[09:38:31.0037] <shu>
which makes me think it had copied the number glyphs from 10 years ago

[09:38:38.0112] <shu>
and since then, Roboto has slightly updated

[09:51:18.0791] <Aki>
:interess:

[09:51:25.0081] <Aki>
thanks for your research shu 

[09:51:28.0091] <Aki>
v helpful

[10:18:20.0340] <shu>
Aki: what're you doing with the logo?

[10:18:59.0130] <Aki>
Nothing for TC39. Possibly throwing together guidance on individual TC logos.

[10:19:14.0973] <shu>
ah

[10:19:53.0724] <shu>
well, i'm sure you can tell that this logo was specifically a nod to the community JS logo. i wouldn't think any of the design here generalizes

[10:23:07.0520] <Chris de Almeida>

TC54 copied it.  what did they use Aki ?

[10:23:14.0090] <Chris de Almeida>
* https://tc54.org/

TC54 copied the style.  what did they use Aki ?

[11:56:15.0216] <Michael Ficarra>
Roboto has an alternative glyph for 9 that appears to match

[12:04:12.0379] <shu>
ah interesting

[12:04:57.0994] <Aki>
Conveniently, Ecma's website also uses Roboto

[16:35:06.0095] <Aki>
OMG Y'ALL. 100% SUMMARIES AND CONCLUSIONS. 

[16:35:10.0718] <Aki>
Thank you all so much!

syg: I just noticed that Explicit Resource Management is shipping in Chrome, despite [the source](https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8/+/refs/heads/main/src/flags/flag-definitions.h#295) suggesting it is behind the `--harmony` flag.  Does Chromium always enable `--harmony` now?


[07:28:47.0819] <shu>
no, it is shipping, and we don't enable `--harmony`

[07:28:59.0295] <shu>
it's shipping by being default to on in chromium

[07:31:44.0808] <shu>
the odd state of affairs (default on in chromium, default off in v8) is due to test expectations annoyances in chromium. we kept it off in v8 in case we needed to unship in chromium

[07:31:59.0256] <shu>
should be safe to default to on now
