i would be surprised if any user actually didn't understand that typescript wasn't what runs in the actual application

[22:47:23.0604] <sffc>
About Decimal and primitives, littledan's logic makes a lot of sense to me. If we were to have decimals as a primitive, they would need to be normalized (no quantum). However, the champions have presented rationale for why decimals should retain their quantum. Therefore, Decimals should be objects, not primitives.

This logic flows completely independently from any argument about whether or not engines may eventually change their position on decimals being a new primitive.

You‚Äôd be surprised üòÉ

[01:14:31.0235] <Rob Palmer>
In the old days, folk learned JS before they learned TS, so had a strong mental model of the difference.

Nowadays many people learn TS first (or at least, it's not sequenced).

And we have runtimes with built-in support, further hiding the difference.

[10:42:04.0754] <ljharb>
are most of those newcomers using those alternative runtimes tho?

[10:53:17.0347] <Anthony Bullard>
Definitely not. Most still use the browser - though through transpilers - or node(same).

[10:59:09.0824] <ljharb>
that matches my intuition - anyone who's using "not browsers or unflagged node" is not a newcomer and knows the difference.

I don‚Äôt understand your point. To users writing functions, `deferred`/`immediate` seems very similar to `readonly` in `readonly number[]` which tells the user they can‚Äôt don `foo[0] = 1`. `derred () => void` means they can‚Äôt call that function within their function body, only pass it off to another deferring function or store it for later.

[12:40:06.0296] <ljharb>
`: readonly number[]` tho. it's part of the type.

[13:47:04.0378] <Justin Ridgewell>
Yes, and `: deferred () => void` is part of the type, too.

[13:48:20.0219] <Justin Ridgewell>
The type system should error if you call a defferred callback sync, the same way it will if you mutate a readonly array.

[15:56:04.0325] <shu>
is the only way to observe number of ticks via user code `then` handlers?

if i have some spec doing the following:

```
let p1 = new %Promise%;
let p2 = new %Promise%;
PerformPromiseThen(p2, () => p1, () => {});
return p2;
```

where `p1` and `p2` are built-in promises, and `p1` never escapes to user code, are the two ticks unobservable? is that equivalent to returning `p1` directly?

[16:06:42.0483] <bakkot>
shu: do you meant to have `let p3 = PerformPromiseThen(p2, () => p1, () => {}); return p3`? Or are you really intending to return the original `p2`?

[16:08:46.0701] <shu>
i am intending to return original `p2`, that's a PerformPromiseThen as in our AO, not p2.then

[16:08:59.0641] <shu>
like p2 does nothing except inherit p1's eventual state

[16:09:41.0950] <shu>
wait i think that pseudocode is just borked

[16:10:26.0341] <shu>
it's like `PerformPromiseThen(p1, () => Resolve(p2))`

[16:16:52.0203] <bakkot>
in this example p1 never resolves so it is perforce not observable

[16:16:58.0542] <bakkot>
perhaps you intend p1 to start out resolved?

[16:18:13.0695] <shu>
yes, i think starting out resolved is equivalent to what's actually happening

[16:20:08.0057] <bakkot>
in which case, the difference is observable iff someone is keeping track of ticks while this all is going on, I believe? which they could be

[16:20:27.0168] <bakkot>
```
(async () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {
    console.log(i);
    await 0;
  }
})();

// compare:
(async () => {
  let p1 = Promise.resolve();
  
  p1.then(() => { console.log('done 1'); });
})();

// vs:
(async () => {
  let p1 = Promise.resolve();
  
  let resolveP2;
  let p2 = new Promise(res => { resolveP2 = res; });
  
  p1.then(resolveP2);
  
  p2.then(() => { console.log('done 2'); });
})();
```

[16:21:03.0396] <bakkot>
 * ```
(async () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    console.log(i);
    await 0;
  }
})();

// compare:
(async () => {
  let p1 = Promise.resolve();
  
  p1.then(() => { console.log('done 1'); });
})();

// vs:
(async () => {
  let p1 = Promise.resolve();
  
  let resolveP2;
  let p2 = new Promise(res => { resolveP2 = res; });
  
  p1.then(resolveP2);
  
  p2.then(() => { console.log('done 2'); });
})();
```

[16:24:21.0776] <shu>
ah, of course, thanks for the example

[16:24:28.0087] <shu>
cursed global queue

[16:56:37.0366] <ljharb>
> <@jridgewell:matrix.org> Yes, and `: deferred () => void` is part of the type, too.

ok i think we're violently in agreement :-) i just don't want the keyword appearing where an ES keyword could, but after a colon is where i'd expect it

[23:38:43.0216] <Ashley Claymore>
If the keyword only works in some places and not others might be confusing. e.g if can't change:

```
function f(cb: immediate Fn) { cb() }
```

to

```
type T = immediate Fn;
function f(cb: T) { cb() }
```

`unique symbol` is similarly restricted

[07:19:39.0166] <Ashley Claymore>
True. It's like the reverse. And its not `const s: symbol = unique new Symbol()`
good point 

[12:24:43.0442] <bakkot>
Michael Ficarra: why does https://github.com/michaelficarra/proposal-concurrency-control include concurrent `reduce`? does that make sense in some way I'm not immediately seeing?

[12:26:07.0560] <bakkot>
I guess the idea is that a lot of operations are associative? but the types only work out if your reducer function is `(T, T) -> T` and not `(A, T) -> A`

[12:29:27.0019] <Michael Ficarra>
yep, don't do concurrent reduce if your operation isn't associative


2024-08-03
[15:54:07.0335] <snek>
this is good advice for synchronous code too


2024-08-06
[18:48:15.0558] <Michael Ficarra>
@devsnek:matrix.org nah, non-associative reducers are fine when you're iterating in-order

[18:50:55.0452] <Michael Ficarra>

[00:29:04.0460] <rkirsling>
technically it's straightforward to break down üòÜ

[00:29:40.0669] <rkirsling>
effectively "initial algebra = initial object of type algebra"

[00:31:51.0854] <rkirsling>
 * effectively "initial algebra = initial object of type Algebra<F>"

[00:32:45.0975] <rkirsling>
i.e. "if you have learned what an initial object and an algebra are, then you're ready to understand what an initial algebra is"

> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> the only morphism i need is monomorphism üôèüôèüôè

I was so confused by this at first because a monomorphism is an injective homomorphism. But you mean like, as opposed to polymorphic/megamorphic.

[15:23:14.0733] <shu>
hell yeah i do brother


2024-08-07
[18:40:06.0246] <rkirsling>
I have definitely been confused by that before (in the reverse direction of shu)

I've written up some stuff about how iterators / generators / etc work https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/iterator-protocol/iterator-protocol.md

[10:35:46.0101] <bakkot>
does anyone have opinions where it should live? by default I would shove it in how-we-work but that's not necessarily the best place


2024-08-12
[06:54:56.0237] <Michael Ficarra>
honestly, MDN

[09:56:05.0333] <shu>
i agree how-we-work doesn't feel appropriate

[09:57:00.0852] <shu>
it also doesn't appropriate for MDN as general web developer-facing documentation. are there MDN articles that are tagged like "internals, intended for implementers, tooling authors, polyfill authors, etc"?
