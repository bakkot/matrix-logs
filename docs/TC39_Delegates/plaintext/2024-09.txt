I wonder if ecma can provide hotel discounts to delegates for the Japan meeting 👀

We'd also appreciate it if you can register early (sometime this week) if you already know you're attending, to help us estimate the amount of catering (+ dietary restrictions), seats, and TC39@SIE exclusive souvenirs (❗️) needed.

Please feel free to ask me anything via DMs or https://matrix.to/#/!esMMWWzCSbZuzkptYP:matrix.org?via=matrix.org if you had any questions/comments/concerns!

Looking forward to seeing you all at TOKYOOOO 🇯🇵

apropos: is there a matrix channel for in-person attendees?

[23:26:30.0144] <Jesse>
(and do we still have some TC39 trucker hats?)

[00:47:36.0256] <rkirsling>
it's the channel linked in the message above, but it's possible that you may need to be added to it
