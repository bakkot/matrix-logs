I wonder if ecma can provide hotel discounts to delegates for the Japan meeting üëÄ

[21:43:16.0109] <ljharb>
how would it obtain them? i guess it could try to reserve a block

apropos: is there a matrix channel for in-person attendees?

[23:26:30.0144] <Jesse>
(and do we still have some TC39 trucker hats?)

[00:47:36.0256] <rkirsling>
it's the channel linked in the message above, but it's possible that you may need to be added to it

[01:41:52.0936] <Jesse>
ah, I see -- the channel name shows up for me as a long random ID. I guess Rob is in charge of the invites to that channel?

[03:42:08.0793] <saminahusain>
Yes, we still have TC39 hats and beanies. 

[10:56:16.0677] <Rob Palmer>
Hello all, 

If you are a fan of hats and would like to collect one in-person at the Tokyo meeting, please remember to [sign up soon](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/537#issuecomment-2329646368) for in-person attendance.  So far we have at least 17 people attending.

[10:59:36.0853] <ljharb>
(ps that's not just because it's the only standalone hat emoji, it's also because i want a TC39 top hat)

[11:05:47.0473] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I wish there was a subscription for distracted hat-loosers delegates to get one every 6 months

üëã Hi, I'm [Eli](https://dangerous.link/virus.exe)! You may have seen me in your stacktraces, inadvertently breaking your iterator helpers proposal and ossifying misc undefined behaviors. I participate in TG3, contribute to various standards groups, and work on privacy and security tools such as airgap.js (closed source) and Penumbra.js (open source) at Transcend.

I'm looking forward to joining plenary, although I'll only be able to attend remotely this time

[12:44:19.0322] <Eli Grey>
oh sorry I thought matrix had threads

[12:44:48.0123] <Eli Grey>
 * oops, used the wrong button for making a thread

[12:45:08.0284] <Eli Grey>
note: airgap.js is privacy governance engine that lives in a psuedo-Realms Initialization Control polyfill and penumbra is a streaming crypto library

[12:46:53.0857] <bakkot>
just hide that button, the threads UX on element is awful

[12:48:27.0111] <Eli Grey>
I also like to do security research into the products I depend on when I have the time (& appropriate rights/permissions to conduct the research)

[08:42:20.0724] <canadahonk>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> I wish there was a subscription for distracted hat-looser delegates to get one every 6 months

they should make an ecma member bonus where you pay more and get merch-

[08:50:15.0350] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm against anything that would privilege delegates over invited experts :P

[09:21:18.0159] <Eli Grey>
Is it possible to get TC39 swag without going to the plenary in-person? I'm getting hat FOMO üòÖ

[10:12:57.0033] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> I'm against anything that would privilege delegates over invited experts :P

we could always charge invited experts

[10:14:27.0843] <shu>
i think we should just create bootleg merch

[10:14:58.0872] <shu>
art yearns to circumvent intellectual property regimes

[10:24:22.0510] <Eli Grey>
Also, pins/magnets for bags would be very cool

[10:45:44.0968] <canadahonk>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> I'm against anything that would privilege delegates over invited experts :P

<del>I would become a member just for merch</del>

[11:09:44.0030] <Chris de Almeida>
we may arrange swag for remote participants who help with notes during plenary

[11:36:20.0421] <shu>
but anyway i have moved beyond tc39 merch

[11:36:28.0977] <shu>
i now only wear gas station merch

[11:42:52.0448] <Anthony Bullard>
> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> we may arrange swag for remote participants who help with notes during plenary

Quite the incentive for attendance and note taking

[11:43:19.0418] <Chris de Almeida>
we can only hope!  üôè

[11:47:25.0480] <shu>
i think you should give out gift cards

[11:47:40.0553] <shu>
or lotto

[11:47:54.0494] <Chris de Almeida>
tell me more about this... lotto

[11:48:49.0934] <Chris de Almeida>
> i think we should just create bootleg merch

who will join my kickstarter for TC39 socks?

[11:57:46.0999] <shu>
they're tickets that you buy, with numbers on them

[11:58:02.0706] <shu>
for some of those numbers, you get money

[11:58:23.0257] <shu>
+EV is diminishingly small but psychologically gambling is awesome

[13:20:26.0178] <ljharb>
i've seen stickers but pins/magnets/patches would be cool

[13:20:44.0947] <nicolo-ribaudo>
What about tatoos

[13:38:56.0934] <Aki>
yall convince the execom and Samina for the budget, i'll arrange it

[14:50:14.0783] <Eli Grey>
speaking of which, is there default ai transcriptions as a fallback when nobody is taking notes?

[14:51:29.0506] <Eli Grey>
 * speaking of which, are there ai transcriptions when nobody is taking notes?

[14:52:11.0613] <Chris de Almeida>
professional transcriptionists are professionally transcribing

[14:52:46.0046] <Chris de Almeida>
people helping with notes are there for attribution and making corrections transcription mistakes in realtime

lotto is a gift card that, mostly, you can't use, so no real difference from a normal gift card

it's so funny to me that async functions cannot synchronously throw, but async generators can

[16:25:53.0332] <ljharb>
huh, that def seems like a mistake in the design of async gens. was it intentional?


2024-09-10
[17:01:14.0916] <shu>
i think there's no other way, because async generators return a generator object that vends promises, they don't return a promise directly

[17:01:44.0006] <shu>
so, parameter expressions like defaults can cause synchronous errors before the async generator gets a chance to create the generator object to return

[17:02:20.0000] <shu>
whereas async functions always returns a promise, so they can create the promise first thing, _then_ evaluate parameter expressions

[17:07:43.0799] <shu>
 * whereas async functions always return a promise, so they can create the promise first thing, _then_ evaluate parameter expressions

[18:03:12.0616] <ljharb>

:) Yeah, I'll go to Tokyo meeting.


[07:43:54.0086] <shu>
ljharb: what're the topics for discussion that needs 60m for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dataview-get-set-uint8clamped?

[08:03:45.0811] <ljharb>
the same thing we talked about last time - adding the get method, whether as an alias or not

[08:05:13.0934] <ljharb>
* the same thing we talked about last time - adding the get method, whether as an alias or not. obv i hope I‚Äôm grossly overestimating the timebox :-)

[08:05:44.0071] <nicolo-ribaudo>
_consensus by talking until when everybody else is exhausted_

> <@ljharb:matrix.org> the same thing we talked about last time - adding the get method, whether as an alias or not. obv i hope I‚Äôm grossly overestimating the timebox :-)

i'm very skeptical there is 60 minutes of productive discussion

[08:22:58.0342] <shu>
i think we should be respectful of scheduled time and go with a good faith estimate

[08:23:06.0335] <shu>
like we could all be reserving 90mins just in case

[08:23:08.0223] <shu>
but we shouldn't

[08:24:54.0663] <ljharb>
it is a good faith estimate.

[08:26:12.0523] <shu>
you just said you're hopeful that you're "grossly overestimating"?

[08:26:28.0695] <ljharb>
hopeful doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm certain that‚Äôs the case. It‚Äôs just optimism.

[08:27:13.0201] <shu>
okay, i'll retract "good faith", i mean something like not estimating for worst case, but for average case

[08:28:34.0875] <ljharb>
i mean worst case is that we overflow 60m, which I‚Äôm concerned about doing.

[08:29:31.0614] <shu>
then i'll come back to the original question, what are the discussion topics here that'll take that amount of time? is there new info and arguments re: adding the get method?

[08:29:35.0482] <ljharb>
if the chairs need more time, they can reach out to me or whoever else, and ask to reduce timeboxes - I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs a big issue at this point

[08:29:55.0581] <ljharb>
no new info, but i want us to get to a decision this plenary.

[08:30:14.0836] <ljharb>
new info would probably make it a much shorter discussion.

[08:32:43.0160] <shu>
it's *a* issue for me because i want plenary time to be productive

[10:00:04.0895] <bakkot>
I am excited for `emplace` but dminor you may want to consider a larger timebox

[10:00:20.0553] <bakkot>
I do think there's room for 60 minutes of productive discussion on that topic, given the size of the design space

[10:02:57.0181] <bakkot>
personally I like the direction you've proposed; I would call it `getOrInit` and then have a separate `.compute((k, v, isPresent) => newV)` function for doing the insert-or-update pattern (possibly in a follow-on proposal)

[10:03:26.0930] <bakkot>
the fact that `getOrInit` does not require you to create a throwaway object/closure makes it a lot more appealing than the thing currently in the proposal

[11:45:25.0119] <rbuckton>
I might suggest `getOrAdd` and `addOrUpdate`. "init" seems like the wrong term since this isn't initialization, per se. "compute" is also a fairly overloaded term.

[11:47:32.0496] <rbuckton>
 * I might suggest `getOrAdd` (or `getOrInsert`) and `addOrUpdate` (or `setOrUpdate`). "init" seems like the wrong term since this isn't initialization, per se. "compute" is also a fairly overloaded term.

[11:51:15.0208] <rbuckton>
Or, for the insert-or-update pattern, `ensure` is a term I regularly use for functions using this pattern.
