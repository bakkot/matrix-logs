> <@canadahonk:matrix.org> ðŸ‘‹ hi folks! as a small intro, I'm Oliver (or `@canadahonk`). you may have seen me around as I actively contribute to WinterCG and make an ahead-of-time JS engine/compiler/etc, [Porffor](https://porffor.dev) (now full-time!). excited to get more into standards and hope to see some of you in Tokyo! (but also happy to chat in dms anytime)
