> <@canadahonk:matrix.org> 👋 hi folks! as a small intro, I'm Oliver (or `@canadahonk`). you may have seen me around as I actively contribute to WinterCG and make an ahead-of-time JS engine/compiler/etc, [Porffor](https://porffor.dev) (now full-time!). excited to get more into standards and hope to see some of you in Tokyo! (but also happy to chat in dms anytime)

Hey! I saw your talk at Web Engines Hackfest! Very cool, happy you're here!

I wonder if ecma can provide hotel discounts to delegates for the Japan meeting 👀

[21:43:16.0109] <ljharb>
how would it obtain them? i guess it could try to reserve a block

apropos: is there a matrix channel for in-person attendees?

[23:26:30.0144] <Jesse>
(and do we still have some TC39 trucker hats?)

[00:47:36.0256] <rkirsling>
it's the channel linked in the message above, but it's possible that you may need to be added to it

[01:41:52.0936] <Jesse>
ah, I see -- the channel name shows up for me as a long random ID. I guess Rob is in charge of the invites to that channel?

[03:42:08.0793] <saminahusain>
Yes, we still have TC39 hats and beanies. 

[10:56:16.0677] <Rob Palmer>
Hello all, 

If you are a fan of hats and would like to collect one in-person at the Tokyo meeting, please remember to [sign up soon](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/537#issuecomment-2329646368) for in-person attendance.  So far we have at least 17 people attending.

[10:59:36.0853] <ljharb>
(ps that's not just because it's the only standalone hat emoji, it's also because i want a TC39 top hat)

[11:05:47.0473] <nicolo-ribaudo>

they should make an ecma member bonus where you pay more and get merch-

[08:50:15.0350] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm against anything that would privilege delegates over invited experts :P

[09:21:18.0159] <Eli Grey>
Is it possible to get TC39 swag without going to the plenary in-person? I'm getting hat FOMO 😅

[10:12:57.0033] <Michael Ficarra>

it's so funny to me that async functions cannot synchronously throw, but async generators can

[16:25:53.0332] <ljharb>
huh, that def seems like a mistake in the design of async gens. was it intentional?


2024-09-10
[17:01:14.0916] <shu>
i think there's no other way, because async generators return a generator object that vends promises, they don't return a promise directly

[17:01:44.0006] <shu>
so, parameter expressions like defaults can cause synchronous errors before the async generator gets a chance to create the generator object to return

[17:02:20.0000] <shu>
whereas async functions always returns a promise, so they can create the promise first thing, _then_ evaluate parameter expressions

[17:07:43.0799] <shu>
 * whereas async functions always return a promise, so they can create the promise first thing, _then_ evaluate parameter expressions

ljharb: what're the topics for discussion that needs 60m for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dataview-get-set-uint8clamped?

[08:03:45.0811] <ljharb>
the same thing we talked about last time - adding the get method, whether as an alias or not

[08:05:13.0934] <ljharb>
* the same thing we talked about last time - adding the get method, whether as an alias or not. obv i hope I’m grossly overestimating the timebox :-)

> <@ljharb:matrix.org> the same thing we talked about last time - adding the get method, whether as an alias or not. obv i hope I’m grossly overestimating the timebox :-)

i'm very skeptical there is 60 minutes of productive discussion

[08:22:58.0342] <shu>
i think we should be respectful of scheduled time and go with a good faith estimate

[08:23:06.0335] <shu>
like we could all be reserving 90mins just in case

[08:23:08.0223] <shu>
but we shouldn't

[08:24:54.0663] <ljharb>
it is a good faith estimate.

[08:26:12.0523] <shu>
you just said you're hopeful that you're "grossly overestimating"?

[08:26:28.0695] <ljharb>
hopeful doesn’t mean that I’m certain that’s the case. It’s just optimism.

[08:27:13.0201] <shu>
okay, i'll retract "good faith", i mean something like not estimating for worst case, but for average case

[08:28:34.0875] <ljharb>
i mean worst case is that we overflow 60m, which I’m concerned about doing.

[08:29:31.0614] <shu>
then i'll come back to the original question, what are the discussion topics here that'll take that amount of time? is there new info and arguments re: adding the get method?

[08:29:35.0482] <ljharb>
if the chairs need more time, they can reach out to me or whoever else, and ask to reduce timeboxes - I’m not sure why it’s a big issue at this point

[08:29:55.0581] <ljharb>
no new info, but i want us to get to a decision this plenary.

[08:30:14.0836] <ljharb>
new info would probably make it a much shorter discussion.

[08:32:43.0160] <shu>
it's *a* issue for me because i want plenary time to be productive

[10:00:04.0895] <bakkot>
I am excited for `emplace` but dminor you may want to consider a larger timebox

[10:00:20.0553] <bakkot>
I do think there's room for 60 minutes of productive discussion on that topic, given the size of the design space

[10:02:57.0181] <bakkot>
personally I like the direction you've proposed; I would call it `getOrInit` and then have a separate `.compute((k, v, isPresent) => newV)` function for doing the insert-or-update pattern (possibly in a follow-on proposal)

[10:03:26.0930] <bakkot>
the fact that `getOrInit` does not require you to create a throwaway object/closure makes it a lot more appealing than the thing currently in the proposal

[11:45:25.0119] <rbuckton>
I might suggest `getOrAdd` and `addOrUpdate`. "init" seems like the wrong term since this isn't initialization, per se. "compute" is also a fairly overloaded term.

[11:47:32.0496] <rbuckton>
 * I might suggest `getOrAdd` (or `getOrInsert`) and `addOrUpdate` (or `setOrUpdate`). "init" seems like the wrong term since this isn't initialization, per se. "compute" is also a fairly overloaded term.

[11:51:15.0208] <rbuckton>
Or, for the insert-or-update pattern, `ensure` is a term I regularly use for functions using this pattern.

[11:51:39.0323] <rbuckton>
 * `ensure` is also a term I regularly use for functions using this pattern.

[12:57:52.0441] <bakkot>
`getOrInsert` works just as well for me, but isn't it initialization? it's taking something which previously didn't exist (a mapping for a specific key) and causing it to exist. 

[12:58:56.0459] <bakkot>
`compute` I was just copying from Java's method of the same name

[13:00:42.0332] <bakkot>
haskell has `alter` which... is basically as generic as possible

[13:09:10.0524] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> `getOrInsert` works just as well for me, but isn't it initialization? it's taking something which previously didn't exist (a mapping for a specific key) and causing it to exist.

"initialization" just seems somewhat awkward if you potentially delete the value on the previous line:
```js
if (forceReset) map.delete(key);
return map.getOrInit(key, ...);
```

[13:10:37.0220] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> `compute` I was just copying from Java's method of the same name

In Java it's `computeIfAbsent`/`computeIfPresent`. You need the second half of the method name for context.

[13:11:02.0307] <bakkot>
it has the bare `compute` as well https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#compute-K-java.util.function.BiFunction-

[13:13:37.0801] <rbuckton>
I suppose it does. I still contend it it's a fairly overloaded term.

[13:13:45.0509] <bakkot>
certainly agreed there


2024-09-13
[19:48:07.0489] <ljharb>
i still think "upsert" is the best term, and will be the most familiar to web devs from mysql (and postgres docs reference the term so people will know how to do it, because it's the most familiar term)

> <@bakkot:matrix.org> haskell has `alter` which... is basically as generic as possible

`alter :: (Eq k, Hashable k) => (Maybe v -> Maybe v) -> k -> HashMap k v -> HashMap k v` is crazy, I was not expecting that

[10:38:29.0984] <shu>
another L for the category theorists

[10:47:06.0684] <Michael Ficarra>
I mean it's cool that every `Maybe v -> Maybe v` is an operation that makes sense, but I'd probably just make 4 functions

[10:50:07.0273] <Ashley Claymore>
I assume `Some -> None` deletes the key? Rather than implies no alteration

was trying to get this figured out in our Tokyo planning channel but I guess the individuals who would know are not in there:

[17:29:10.0837] <rkirsling>
have hosts at other orgs needed to struggle to get an AV setup realized -- specifically, wrt to ensuring that local and remote audio are adequately integrated?

[17:29:14.0648] <rkirsling>
 * have hosts at other orgs needed to struggle to get an AV setup realized -- specifically, wr ensuring that local and remote audio are adequately integrated?

[17:29:17.0989] <rkirsling>
 * have hosts at other orgs needed to struggle to get an AV setup realized -- specifically, wrt ensuring that local and remote audio are adequately integrated?

[17:36:45.0836] <rkirsling>
basically I had never thought about how a mic'ing setup designed for video conferencing (i.e. a series of fixed-position mics on the tables which all mute/unmute together) is fundamentally different from the individual mic'ing setup that our plenaries depend upon

[17:40:31.0443] <rkirsling>
so our AV people were like, well we could rent individual mics and have them hooked up to one or more local speakers, but it seems super unclear whether there could be a good experience with two totally separated systems for local audio and remote audio

[17:41:08.0473] <rkirsling>
and it's all very frustrating because I didn't expect this to be viewed as so special or to require such a battle

[17:49:48.0067] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah it's surprisingly difficult lol 🤷‍♂️

[17:50:17.0544] <Michael Ficarra>
turns out most business meetings aren't UN-style and don't have these requirements

[19:01:05.0010] <Mathieu Hofman>
Audio systems that work well for both local and remote attendees are a rarity and somewhat expensive. Echo cancellation is really hard to get right.

[10:18:14.0753] <shu>
the best experience i remember was the one in Portland that had those UN-style per-seat mics

[10:20:10.0990] <Michael Ficarra>
yep that one was fantastic

[11:54:34.0633] <shu>
does Sony make telepresence robots

[11:55:25.0358] <shu>

For Helsinki I ended up buying all of the audio gear (except the cables, those I got from the university), because that was cheaper and more convenient than renting. Total cost was somewhere around EUR 1200. To make that work, I got a mixer board with 12 inputs and separate outputs for the in-room speakers and the sound card of the laptop connected to zoom.

[20:37:48.0450] <rkirsling>
wow

[00:52:33.0990] <Ashley Claymore>

[17:33:50.0637] <Justin Ridgewell>
I think the spec could be easy enough, but the challenge is making sure browsers don’t run a UTF8 step before letting JS parse.

[18:09:49.0311] <bakkot>
I don't think engines would go for that, no

[18:09:53.0397] <bakkot>
or other tools, for that matter

[18:10:22.0526] <bakkot>
just do `Uint8Array.fromBase64(/*data*/)`; after gzip this should be basically the same size anyway

[20:33:07.0931] <Justin Ridgewell>
I’m trying to avoid Base64’s byte increase and the time needed to decode it (10ms+ for each of several stings)

[05:09:32.0474] <bakkot>
I would expect Uint8Array.fromBase64 to be a great deal faster than that.

[05:12:04.0056] <bakkot>

afaict, the base64 parser for data: URIs is called https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:net/base/data_url.cc;l=150;drc=f522344e45882da4c7f7cb1b3a0a7bd747d654bb which means it's https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/modp_b64/modp_b64.cc;drc=f522344e45882da4c7f7cb1b3a0a7bd747d654bb;l=118 which is not at all optimized

[07:52:16.0166] <bakkot>
I am hoping Chrome will do what Safari did for base64, which is to use https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf, which uses SIMD and should be able to decode at ~ the speed of memory

base64 should only very barely affect response size after gzip so I don't think that should matter

[07:57:05.0148] <bakkot>
for loading images you'd need to turn that into a blob and then make a blob url, but I would expect that to be cheap too 

[08:01:26.0789] <bakkot>
also you'd need to do that either way since `data:` URIs can't contain arbitrary bytes anyway

I’ll see if this is a possibility.

> base64 should only very barely affect response size after gzip so I don't think that should matter
The network bytes themselves look fine (7.4kb brotli q3 vs 7.3kb raw bytes), but they’re literally worring about the decompressed size and how it affects the resource prescanner and JS parser.

> also you'd need to do that either way since data: URIs can't contain arbitrary bytes anyway
`data:` URIs are feed straight to `img.src = '…’`, but if we can get raw bytes literal we would create a blob object, get and object id, and feed that to the src.

Greetings from TPAC. Y'all let me know if you're here or if you want me dropping in on any meetings on behalf of TC39

[15:33:07.0074] <Aki>
why do people keep asking me if we're introducing typescript types did i miss a headline

[15:35:30.0019] <shu>
are they misunderstanding what the types-as-comments proposal does?

[15:40:55.0587] <ljharb>
virtually everyone who talks about the proposal on social media or on the github repo seems to

[15:49:25.0794] <Aki>
ohhhh that would make sense. because when i oversimplify and tell people we're sorta committed to staying out of the way, they seem to get it

[15:49:52.0035] <Aki>
though i always add a big "i can't predict the future" caveat

Aki: For extra fun, you could also point them at the extractors proposal, which'll get us runtime types instead: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-extractors/issues/20

Yeah engaging on the repo with almost anyone seems useless, since nobody actually understands what's being proposed. Everyone's just reacting against some idea they have about putting types in.

it has indeed been there forever and you might be the first person to ever notice/mention it, and/or understand the reference.  🏆️

I once visited a mutual friend of @domenic while they were undergrads at caltech and was shown a fire extinguisher that had been labeled in sharpie: rogdort, anti-burninator

[06:56:31.0560] <kriskowal>
Though, notably, we did not know we were mutuals until long after domenic had been working with me on Q promises. Life finds a way

ServiceNow has had in its Chicago office (my home base) a roughly three foot tall drawing of Trogdor on a whiteboard you have to go out of your way to find. But, 5 years on, it still remains.  Even the building janitorial staff respects his power.

[07:27:44.0744] <Anthony Bullard>
It is one of my favorite bits of office culture ever

[12:22:45.0300] <kriskowal>
People seem to universally respect whiteboard art. I drew flowering vines in the margins of an enormous whiteboard at Uber and they definitely burned in and can never be erased. I waited for months for someone, anyone to erase a fantasy map I’d left on some high value whiteboard real estate, and ultimately had to do it myself.

is the number of ticks a dynamic `import()` takes host-defined?

[12:01:40.0755] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Only if it has not been imported yet from the same module

[12:01:56.0237] <shu>
cool, thanks
