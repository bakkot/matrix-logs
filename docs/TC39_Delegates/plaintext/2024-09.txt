I wonder if ecma can provide hotel discounts to delegates for the Japan meeting 👀

[21:43:16.0109] <ljharb>
how would it obtain them? i guess it could try to reserve a block

apropos: is there a matrix channel for in-person attendees?

[23:26:30.0144] <Jesse>
(and do we still have some TC39 trucker hats?)

[00:47:36.0256] <rkirsling>
it's the channel linked in the message above, but it's possible that you may need to be added to it

[01:41:52.0936] <Jesse>
ah, I see -- the channel name shows up for me as a long random ID. I guess Rob is in charge of the invites to that channel?

[03:42:08.0793] <saminahusain>
Yes, we still have TC39 hats and beanies. 

[10:56:16.0677] <Rob Palmer>
Hello all, 

If you are a fan of hats and would like to collect one in-person at the Tokyo meeting, please remember to [sign up soon](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/537#issuecomment-2329646368) for in-person attendance.  So far we have at least 17 people attending.

[10:59:36.0853] <ljharb>
(ps that's not just because it's the only standalone hat emoji, it's also because i want a TC39 top hat)

[11:05:47.0473] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I wish there was a subscription for distracted hat-loosers delegates to get one every 6 months

you can steal mine, i never wear hats

👋 Hi, I'm [Eli](https://dangerous.link/virus.exe)! You may have seen me in your stacktraces, inadvertently breaking your iterator helpers proposal and ossifying misc undefined behaviors. I participate in TG3, contribute to various standards groups, and work on privacy and security tools such as airgap.js (closed source) and Penumbra.js (open source) at Transcend.

I'm looking forward to joining plenary, although I'll only be able to attend remotely this time

[12:44:19.0322] <Eli Grey>
oh sorry I thought matrix had threads

[12:44:48.0123] <Eli Grey>
 * oops, used the wrong button for making a thread

[12:45:08.0284] <Eli Grey>
note: airgap.js is privacy governance engine that lives in a psuedo-Realms Initialization Control polyfill and penumbra is a streaming crypto library

[12:46:53.0857] <bakkot>
just hide that button, the threads UX on element is awful

[12:48:27.0111] <Eli Grey>
I also like to do security research into the products I depend on when I have the time (& appropriate rights/permissions to conduct the research)

[12:58:23.0564] <Eli Grey>

omg it's yusukesuzuki

[17:43:26.0079] <rkirsling>
does this mean you're coming to the meeting?!

[08:42:20.0724] <canadahonk>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> I wish there was a subscription for distracted hat-looser delegates to get one every 6 months

they should make an ecma member bonus where you pay more and get merch-

[08:50:15.0350] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm against anything that would privilege delegates over invited experts :P

[09:21:18.0159] <Eli Grey>
Is it possible to get TC39 swag without going to the plenary in-person? I'm getting hat FOMO 😅

[10:12:57.0033] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> I'm against anything that would privilege delegates over invited experts :P

we could always charge invited experts

[10:14:27.0843] <shu>
i think we should just create bootleg merch

[10:14:58.0872] <shu>
art yearns to circumvent intellectual property regimes

[10:24:22.0510] <Eli Grey>
Also, pins/magnets for bags would be very cool

[10:45:44.0968] <canadahonk>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> I'm against anything that would privilege delegates over invited experts :P

<del>I would become a member just for merch</del>
