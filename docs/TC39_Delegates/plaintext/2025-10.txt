Any further details on the 2026 agenda? We need to lock down the week for a company event in January and really need it not to conflict with plenary.

first 2026 meeting is Jan 20-22

[08:35:50.0241] <eemeli>
Virtual, right? Or so at least I understood from the discussion at the very end of the plenary.

[08:36:05.0046] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Yes

[08:36:06.0543] <Chris de Almeida>
yes, remote-only

I've got a couple of `TypedArray`-related proposals for the agenda next month in Tokyo that I'm looking forward to presenting. Slides are here if anyone wants to get a head start: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIhMpf4gY2wX0KZcmCUU6i9l9Ay7WBu0vY4vIsJUwTg/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p .. We can save discussion for the plenary, just wanted to provide a heads up.

We can save discussion for the plenary, just wanted to provide a heads up. These would be for Stage 1 consideration.

[09:46:48.0053] <bakkot>
James M Snell: nice. Some feedback: for stage 1 it helps to establish motivation for solving the problem, ideally with several examples. The WritableStream one is good but could use more, others need them too. I think this is especially true for swap16 etc because I can't imagine many applications which would want that and just "this API exists elsewhere" isn't a good enough reason without establishing it does something people need to do

[09:49:41.0088] <James M Snell>
Yeah, over the next week or two I plan to fill in more of those details. The key ones I'm looking to get to Stage 1 now are the concat and find within, so I'll be focusing on those. The others are more background that I'll likely push for later. Mostly included those for additional context tho.... I'd really like to replace most of the use cases for Buffer

[09:51:07.0996] <James M Snell>
the swapN functions are fairly specialized and I've only seen them used in very limited cases so those I can easily see not moving forward on

[11:32:12.0052] <Aki>
I wish TCQ had a route to having a meeting where the attendees didnâ€™t need to log in. So many TCs would benefit from this tool but GitHub is a bridge too far for the old guard 

[11:33:41.0269] <Chris de Almeida>
oh boy do I have the solution for you!

in this TYOOL 2025 they still can't handle having a github account? O.o

[13:19:21.0484] <dminor>
I'm interested in discussing https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-capturestacktrace at an upcoming TG3, who should I speak to about getting added to the agenda?

[13:20:17.0598] <kriskowal>
I can scribble you in next week. The conveners lurk in #tc39-tg3-security:matrix.org.

[14:50:19.0677] <James M Snell>
I've expanded the concat discussion with a couple more good examples and a link to some prior art based on `Buffer` that sees about 45m+ downloads a week as a reference point

These people come from very different backgrounds from the people you're used to working with. Many still work in Word docs with track changes on.

[07:06:35.0540] <rkirsling>
lol I assumed TYOOL was the name of a committee or a conference at first

[08:10:17.0176] <Chris de Almeida>
then `TCQ.xlsx` will be a revelation!

[08:14:08.0570] <Aki>
omg Chris there's still a Word document put together by IEC in the early 2000s that includes a TABLE that SDOs use to make comments on each other's standards. They warn against changing the table column widths bc then when they compile all the comments they don't match

[08:15:55.0523] <Chris de Almeida>
nice

[08:17:24.0776] <Chris de Almeida>
Yea, verily, the _Old Ways_ offer a beacon of hope in this dark and uncertain times.

python gets lazy module loading https://pep-previews--4622.org.readthedocs.build/pep-0810/

* python proposal for lazy module loading https://pep-previews--4622.org.readthedocs.build/pep-0810/

[00:36:39.0897] <Ashley Claymore>
Nice! There was this one before: https://peps.python.org/pep-0690/
which was opt-out instead of opt-in. But was rejected.
This new one being opt-in (if I'm reading correctly) aligns with how we've approached import-defer

Now that we almost have Temporal, has anyone tried to write a proposal for something like `await sleep(d: Duration)`?

[09:09:48.0350] <bakkot>
The binding constraint there was never Temporal, it was having more exposure to actual clocks in the core language

[09:10:23.0412] <bakkot>
Also the conflict with scheduler.wait, now

[09:12:07.0497] <Chris de Almeida - upcoming OOO: Oct 10-14>
namely, setTimeout is not in the language, which is what idiomatically is used for pause/sleep 

[09:15:01.0463] <Chris de Almeida - upcoming OOO: Oct 10-14>
similar story with observables
