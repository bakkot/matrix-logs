Virtual, right? Or so at least I understood from the discussion at the very end of the plenary.

Yes

[08:36:06.0543] <Chris de Almeida>

I've got a couple of `TypedArray`-related proposals for the agenda next month in Tokyo that I'm looking forward to presenting. Slides are here if anyone wants to get a head start: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIhMpf4gY2wX0KZcmCUU6i9l9Ay7WBu0vY4vIsJUwTg/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p .. We can save discussion for the plenary, just wanted to provide a heads up.
