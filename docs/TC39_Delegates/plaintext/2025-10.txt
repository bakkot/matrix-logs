Any further details on the 2026 agenda? We need to lock down the week for a company event in January and really need it not to conflict with plenary.

Edit: Well I was just told our event week was decided. Let's hope there is no plenary week of Jan 12

first 2026 meeting is Jan 20-22

[08:35:50.0241] <eemeli>
Virtual, right? Or so at least I understood from the discussion at the very end of the plenary.

[08:36:05.0046] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Yes

[08:36:06.0543] <Chris de Almeida>
yes, remote-only

I've got a couple of `TypedArray`-related proposals for the agenda next month in Tokyo that I'm looking forward to presenting. Slides are here if anyone wants to get a head start: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIhMpf4gY2wX0KZcmCUU6i9l9Ay7WBu0vY4vIsJUwTg/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p .. We can save discussion for the plenary, just wanted to provide a heads up.

We can save discussion for the plenary, just wanted to provide a heads up. These would be for Stage 1 consideration.

[09:46:48.0053] <bakkot>
James M Snell: nice. Some feedback: for stage 1 it helps to establish motivation for solving the problem, ideally with several examples. The WritableStream one is good but could use more, others need them too. I think this is especially true for swap16 etc because I can't imagine many applications which would want that and just "this API exists elsewhere" isn't a good enough reason without establishing it does something people need to do

[09:49:41.0088] <James M Snell>
Yeah, over the next week or two I plan to fill in more of those details. The key ones I'm looking to get to Stage 1 now are the concat and find within, so I'll be focusing on those. The others are more background that I'll likely push for later. Mostly included those for additional context tho.... I'd really like to replace most of the use cases for Buffer

[09:51:07.0996] <James M Snell>
the swapN functions are fairly specialized and I've only seen them used in very limited cases so those I can easily see not moving forward on

[11:32:12.0052] <Aki>
I wish TCQ had a route to having a meeting where the attendees didn’t need to log in. So many TCs would benefit from this tool but GitHub is a bridge too far for the old guard 

[11:33:41.0269] <Chris de Almeida>
oh boy do I have the solution for you!

[11:40:03.0912] <ljharb>
in this TYOOL 2025 they still can't handle having a github account? O.o

[13:19:21.0484] <dminor>
I'm interested in discussing https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-capturestacktrace at an upcoming TG3, who should I speak to about getting added to the agenda?

[13:20:17.0598] <kriskowal>
I can scribble you in next week. The conveners lurk in #tc39-tg3-security:matrix.org.

[14:50:19.0677] <James M Snell>
I've expanded the concat discussion with a couple more good examples and a link to some prior art based on `Buffer` that sees about 45m+ downloads a week as a reference point

These people come from very different backgrounds from the people you're used to working with. Many still work in Word docs with track changes on.
