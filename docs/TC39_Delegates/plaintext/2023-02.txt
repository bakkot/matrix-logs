reading through it, it kind of seems like the conclusion of this page is roughly identical (modulo placeholder choice, perhaps) to the JS proposal?

[17:42:22.0845] <littledan>
Huh, I assumed that the range operator| was supposed to subsume pipeline

Wild!

[20:19:41.0362] <bakkot>
honestly kinda like scala's `_`

I mean, PFA would do this with `?`, though doing that with operators required other syntax.

Notes editors: letâ€™s remember to remove the >> and add a blank line between different speakers (and text that you want to render in different paragraphs in general). I did this for some topics but I think we can also do it on-line as well.

[22:10:40.0115] <ljharb>
scala has something like 18 meanings for `_`, it's very confusing until you've internalized all the relevant contexts

[00:50:16.0351] <pipobscure>

What are you talking about? 

[00:50:43.0811] <pipobscure>
So wikipedia is probably not a good source to go for here.

ljharb: Could you clarify how you feel about "ID", an acronym of "identity document"?

This _should_ now be OK for day 1 & 2.

I think we should also keep the practice of starting every paragraph with the acronym, even if it's a continuation of the current speaker. To make it super clear that it is a continuation and not a missing acronym.

Good point, we usually do that and I hadnâ€™t made that fix

One point to note there, the transcriptionist introduces many unnecessary or unnatural newlines

This affects the grammar checking a lot, and is very tedious to clean up(and sometimes to even notice)

[06:00:43.0404] <Ashley Claymore>
yep hopefully that can get sorted at some point. I would say "surely that is an easy part of the software to change" but we all know not to assume the ease of making code changes to software :D

a post-meeting script that replaces newlines where the previous line has text which does not end in punctuation might cover the majority of the occurrences.

[06:03:04.0018] <littledan>
Yes, we complained about these new lines to the transcriptionist, and I will also follow up with the company after this meeting to see if there is any possible fix.

Sorry if that wasnâ€™t clear from the tone. That was me in order to point out how unreliable Wikipedia is for topics where there is controversy. Itâ€™s ok as a lookup for common knowledge stuff, but wherever there is ongoing discussion wikipedia is useless.

[06:06:53.0345] <pipobscure>
Even years of interwebs experience still let me forget that tone doesnâ€™t always translate well. /blush

> <@littledan:matrix.org> Yeah I am pretty baffled, what does vandalizing Wikipedia have to do with what we are discussing?

I resent that (vandalizing?). That was an entirely valid edit. Also you do have to explain why the change is an improvement. Soâ€¦

But it does go to show that some sources (i.e. wikipedia) canâ€™t really be valid precedent in this argument. 

[06:15:44.0148] <littledan>
OK, I think we all know Wikipedia can be editedâ€¦ not sure what that proves

[06:16:18.0107] <littledan>
The bigger point here is, we should be able to collectively bikeshed something and be able to draw a conclusion based on treating all delegates as equal and respecting all the points raised. This is what we are having trouble doing here.

[06:21:25.0219] <littledan>
I think our unanimity model is getting a little frustrating here because folks feel like threats of blocks are being used in a way that makes other delegates feel like their point will be ignored (which would violate the original goal of our consensus-seeking in the first place). This equality/inclusion/process question is a bigger issue than the actual contents of the arguments (since anything will work technically).

[06:51:13.0055] <Anthony Bullard>
Luckily we could ensure that doesn't happen. Scala evolves with a very different process

[06:51:21.0683] <Anthony Bullard>
And values different things

[06:52:07.0796] <Anthony Bullard>
But as someone who wrote it in some capacity professionally for four years, the _ seems like a more natural  placeholder

[06:55:11.0014] <Anthony Bullard>
Compiled languages have it so much easier in many ways...

I would support the change to a consensus model that doesn't require 100% agreement.  I don't like that one veto stops something.

[07:01:28.0344] <msaboff>
I think all other TC's use a true consensus model.

[07:10:41.0802] <Anthony Bullard>
It feels like there needs to be a very clear model of what kind of dissent and by how many parties constitutes a breakage of consensus. 

[07:14:26.0633] <bakkot>
re: async contexts, I am assuming that the behavior is, whenever a function is scheduled to be run on a subsequent microtask tick or turn of the event loop, the host is required to snapshot the current async context bits and then restore them before running the function?

[07:14:42.0457] <HE Shi-Jun>
If not one, how many? To be honest, I feel the problem is not 100% or 80%.

[07:14:43.0402] <bakkot>
i.e. this isn't just for literal `async` but also for stuff like `addEventListener`?

I agree. The failure mode we have is very unfortunate, and this case highlights it. I think this indicates a need for us to reconsider our process.

[07:15:08.0650] <bakkot>
though event listeners are kind of an odd case, because they run _sync_ if you dispatch an event manually, so I'm not totally clear what's supposed to happen there...

yes, there will be a responsibility for the host environment to make sure the event-scheduling APIs it introduces (like `setTimeout`) use something similar to `AsyncContext.wrap` for their callbacks

[07:15:23.0864] <shu>
bakkot: that's been my understanding as well

[07:15:38.0642] <shu>
i'm kind of confused by justin's example saying the propagation point is at the await pause

[07:15:43.0902] <ljharb>
there is a decent list of proposals that were blocked by a lone objector, including some of the folks discussing changing the process here, fwiw. would we revist all of those if there were a process change?

[07:15:49.0057] <shu>
it can't work if it's _just_ promise reactions

[07:16:04.0382] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
right, but those are the hardest to polyfill

[07:16:38.0221] <bakkot>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> i'm kind of confused by justin's example saying the propagation point is at the await pause

the await pause is the point where you are scheduling a thing to be run on a subsequent tick, so that seems consistent?

[07:16:55.0580] <shu>
bakkot: that's the second one, i thought there was a handler scheduled earlier

[07:16:59.0731] <shu>
i might be mixing slides?

[07:17:22.0709] <shu>
anyway my point is just the host hooks i added for incumbent are only for JS callbacks

[07:17:31.0650] <shu>
this needs host event loop hook-ins as well

[07:19:02.0060] <bakkot>
I will ask the question about event listener dispatch I guess

[07:19:20.0285] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
are folks here aware of the V8 methods `v8::Context::{Get,Set}ContinuationPreservedEmbedderData`?

[07:19:40.0756] <shu>
that's not quite enough

[07:19:52.0807] <shu>
we have that, yes, but you need more muxing

[07:19:53.0084] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
I know, but I'm trying to gauge context

[07:20:00.0726] <Ashley Claymore>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> I will ask the question about event listener dispatch I guess

good to ask. Though presumably all APIs could be wrapped in userland anyway. So technically nothing also stopping hosts doing that?

[07:21:09.0059] <bakkot>
Ashley Claymore: the event listener question is less "how is this implemented" and more "what is the thing you want here" - I'm trying to get at the mental model, not the implementation

[07:21:38.0824] <littledan>
I disagree with Justin's example: i think web platform built-ins should do the `wrap` for you. It's more like if you have JS code which queues callbacks, that you want `wrap`.

[07:22:07.0935] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
that becomes a lot easier if/once `AsyncWrap` is standardized

[07:22:15.0978] <Chengzhong Wu>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> Ashley Claymore: the event listener question is less "how is this implemented" and more "what is the thing you want here" - I'm trying to get at the mental model, not the implementation

https://github.com/legendecas/proposal-async-context/issues/19 many events are emitted by runtimes asynchronously

[07:22:43.0641] <littledan>
> <@benjamn:matrix.org> that becomes a lot easier if/once `AsyncWrap` is standardized

Yes, obviously the platform can't do anything if we don't add AsyncContext :) I was just nit-picking

[07:22:53.0651] <bakkot>
Chengzhong Wu: right, and others are emitted synchronously (e.g. by a manual `dispatchEvent`)

[07:24:00.0526] <bakkot>
so: if you register an event listener while within an async context, and then an event is dispatched async by the browser, presumably you want the listener to see the original context. but what if the event is dispatched sync, by `dispatchEvent`? sync dispatch is basically just a weird sort of function call, so it seems like it's the _current_ context, not the original one?

[07:24:10.0550] <bakkot>
not clear to me which context you want there

[07:25:09.0901] <littledan>
Unfortunately the answer might depend on the event

[07:25:10.0726] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
sync function calls should just inherit the current context, leading to the same behavior? (pls clarify)

[07:25:20.0235] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
 * sync function calls should just inherit the current context, leading to the same behavior? (pls clarify)

[07:25:25.0656] <littledan>
and there may be up to three answers for different task types

[07:25:40.0593] <littledan>
this would be part of the DOM/HTML/Node.js integration with AsyncContext

[07:25:42.0959] <Chengzhong Wu>
Yeah, that's the point of an alternative option `captureAsyncContext` of `addEventListener`

[07:25:47.0195] <bakkot>
> <@benjamn:matrix.org> sync function calls should just inherit the current context, leading to the same behavior? (pls clarify)

sorry: the same behavior as what?

[07:26:11.0798] <littledan>
> <@legendecas:matrix.org> Yeah, that's the point of an alternative option `captureAsyncContext` of `addEventListener`

well, there are separate questions about whether we want to give programmatic control, and what the default should be for each event.

[07:26:14.0579] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
the event should be dispatched with the context you bound/wrapped, whether that happens synchronously or async

[07:26:40.0499] <littledan>
> <@benjamn:matrix.org> the event should be dispatched with the context you bound/wrapped, whether that happens synchronously or async

this is definitely sometimes not true. It is really not the right answer for the unhandled rejection event, for example (we are discussing this in an issue)

[07:26:54.0325] <littledan>
I think we have to look event by event to figure this out

[07:27:01.0009] <Ben Newman (Apollo, @benjamn on GH)>
sorry I think we must be talking past each other or about slightly different things

[07:27:05.0231] <bakkot>
> <@benjamn:matrix.org> the event should be dispatched with the context you bound/wrapped, whether that happens synchronously or async

I guess I don't know what those words mean

[07:30:53.0095] <Andreu Botella>
calling a wrapped synchronous function would also let you change a context synchronously

[07:30:58.0936] <bakkot>
OK I think I understand now

[07:35:16.0497] <bakkot>
the fact that not all callbacks will necessarily automatically inherit the context in which the callback was added (depending on the API which adds the callback) is a little bit awkward, since the whole point of this is that you want to define a context which is available when your callback runs _even though your callback is getting registered to run by code you don't control_

[07:35:18.0689] <Michael Ficarra>
is there any precedent for an API like this?

[07:35:31.0823] <Michael Ficarra>
it's a stage 2 concern, but I'm very skeptical that this is the right representation

https://github.com/legendecas/proposal-async-context#prior-arts

[07:39:05.0436] <Chengzhong Wu>
These are javascript precedents. C# also implements similar APIs

[07:39:20.0894] <Ashley Claymore>
Reactivity libraries with dependency tracking like SolidJS also have similar though more domain specific APIs
