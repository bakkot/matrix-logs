reading through it, it kind of seems like the conclusion of this page is roughly identical (modulo placeholder choice, perhaps) to the JS proposal?

Huh, I assumed that the range operator| was supposed to subsume pipeline

Wild!

[20:19:41.0362] <bakkot>
honestly kinda like scala's `_`

I mean, PFA would do this with `?`, though doing that with operators required other syntax.

Notes editors: letâ€™s remember to remove the >> and add a blank line between different speakers (and text that you want to render in different paragraphs in general). I did this for some topics but I think we can also do it on-line as well.

[22:10:40.0115] <ljharb>
scala has something like 18 meanings for `_`, it's very confusing until you've internalized all the relevant contexts

> <@haxjs:matrix.org> At least wikipedia article also use ID as the abbr for identifier or identity ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier )

What are you talking about? 

[00:50:43.0811] <pipobscure>
So wikipedia is probably not a good source to go for here.

[01:27:58.0851] <Ashley Claymore>
`_ ? _ : _`

[03:04:01.0694] <eemeli>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> at any rate i feel very strongly against "Id" but "identifier" or "code" seem fine to me

ljharb: Could you clarify how you feel about "ID", an acronym of "identity document"?

This _should_ now be OK for day 1 & 2.

I think we should also keep the practice of starting every paragraph with the acronym, even if it's a continuation of the current speaker. To make it super clear that it is a continuation and not a missing acronym.

Good point, we usually do that and I hadnâ€™t made that fix

One point to note there, the transcriptionist introduces many unnecessary or unnatural newlines

This affects the grammar checking a lot, and is very tedious to clean up(and sometimes to even notice)
