reading through it, it kind of seems like the conclusion of this page is roughly identical (modulo placeholder choice, perhaps) to the JS proposal?

[17:42:22.0845] <littledan>
Huh, I assumed that the range operator| was supposed to subsume pipeline

[20:17:26.0600] <Ashley Claymore>
Wild!

[20:19:41.0362] <bakkot>
honestly kinda like scala's `_`

I mean, PFA would do this with `?`, though doing that with operators required other syntax.

Notes editors: letâ€™s remember to remove the >> and add a blank line between different speakers (and text that you want to render in different paragraphs in general). I did this for some topics but I think we can also do it on-line as well.

[22:10:40.0115] <ljharb>
scala has something like 18 meanings for `_`, it's very confusing until you've internalized all the relevant contexts

[00:50:16.0351] <pipobscure>
> <@haxjs:matrix.org> At least wikipedia article also use ID as the abbr for identifier or identity ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier )

What are you talking about? 

[00:50:43.0811] <pipobscure>
So wikipedia is probably not a good source to go for here.

[01:27:58.0851] <Ashley Claymore>
`_ ? _ : _`

[03:04:01.0694] <eemeli>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> at any rate i feel very strongly against "Id" but "identifier" or "code" seem fine to me

ljharb: Could you clarify how you feel about "ID", an acronym of "identity document"?

[04:32:39.0479] <Ashley Claymore>
This _should_ now be OK for day 1 & 2.

I think we should also keep the practice of starting every paragraph with the acronym, even if it's a continuation of the current speaker. To make it super clear that it is a continuation and not a missing acronym.

check the page history, someone changed ID to Id yesterday. ðŸ«¥

Good point, we usually do that and I hadnâ€™t made that fix

One point to note there, the transcriptionist introduces many unnecessary or unnatural newlines

This affects the grammar checking a lot, and is very tedious to clean up(and sometimes to even notice)

[06:00:43.0404] <Ashley Claymore>
yep hopefully that can get sorted at some point. I would say "surely that is an easy part of the software to change" but we all know not to assume the ease of making code changes to software :D

a post-meeting script that replaces newlines where the previous line has text which does not end in punctuation might cover the majority of the occurrences.

[06:03:04.0018] <littledan>
Yes, we complained about these new lines to the transcriptionist, and I will also follow up with the company after this meeting to see if there is any possible fix.

Sorry if that wasnâ€™t clear from the tone. That was me in order to point out how unreliable Wikipedia is for topics where there is controversy. Itâ€™s ok as a lookup for common knowledge stuff, but wherever there is ongoing discussion wikipedia is useless.

[06:06:53.0345] <pipobscure>
Even years of interwebs experience still let me forget that tone doesnâ€™t always translate well. /blush

Yeah I am pretty baffled, what does vandalizing Wikipedia have to do with what we are discussing?

I resent that (vandalizing?). That was an entirely valid edit. Also you do have to explain why the change is an improvement. Soâ€¦

But it does go to show that some sources (i.e. wikipedia) canâ€™t really be valid precedent in this argument. 

[06:15:44.0148] <littledan>
OK, I think we all know Wikipedia can be editedâ€¦ not sure what that proves

[06:16:18.0107] <littledan>
The bigger point here is, we should be able to collectively bikeshed something and be able to draw a conclusion based on treating all delegates as equal and respecting all the points raised. This is what we are having trouble doing here.

[06:21:25.0219] <littledan>
I think our unanimity model is getting a little frustrating here because folks feel like threats of blocks are being used in a way that makes other delegates feel like their point will be ignored (which would violate the original goal of our consensus-seeking in the first place). This equality/inclusion/process question is a bigger issue than the actual contents of the arguments (since anything will work technically).
