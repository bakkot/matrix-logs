shouldn't `var r = Proxy.revocable({}, {}); r.revoke(); Array.isArray(r)` throw, per spec? it doesn't in jsc or v8 or firefox. what am i missing?

[09:33:40.0748] <bakkot>
ljharb: you want `Array.isArray(r.proxy)`

[09:33:42.0831] <bakkot>
which does throw

[09:33:48.0181] <ljharb>
ahhh thanks

[09:34:04.0434] <ljharb>

does look like the error message is wrong tho for `var r = Proxy.revocable({}, {}); r.revoke(); Object.prototype.toString.call(r.proxy)` in jsc and v8. filed https://bugs.webkit.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=242342 and https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=13037 ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

The July TC39 plenary meeting is two weeks away. 

This is a gentle reminder that the deadline for adding agenda items that are requesting stage advancement is in less than 4 days time! July 9th, 10:00 PDT

We have a capacity for 15 hours of content during the meeting. Currently we have 4 hours of content, meaning there are 11 hours unallocated. I encourage you to add items to make good use of the time. Content additions after the deadline are also possible but may not qualify for stage advancement.

There are currently 14 remaining in-person places available. So if you intend to attend in-person, please fill in the In-Person Reservation Form soon.

üëÄ I want to do a temperature check on the range proposal (discussion https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Number.range/issues/17 )

Do you think it should be a Iterator (1Ô∏è‚É£) or an Iterable object (üî¢)?

[08:04:30.0283] <zbraniecki>
Can you explain what are the tangible implications of choosing Iterator here?

I generally prefer Iterable, so that a range can be reused:
```js
const oneToTen = Number.range(1, 10);
// prints: 1\n2\n...
for (const x of oneToTen) console.log(x);
// prints: ??? 
for (const x of oneToTen) console.log(x);
```
Its rare that someone will manually step through an iterator rather than use `for..of` or `...`, and the latter will exhaust the iterator, making a range useless after it has been used once.
If you need to step over it manually, you could still use `Symbol.iterator`, so Iterable is vastly more flexible. 
That said, the iterator helpers proposal depends on Iterator (which I still disagree with in principle), but relevant methods could be lifted to a Range as well.
I'm still hoping we could someday have a standalone range/slice syntax like `a..b`, though that can (hopefully) come later.

[08:34:19.0837] <rbuckton (OOF: 7/5 - 7/16)>
(and I am not very good at avoiding work when I'm supposed to be on PTO) 

[09:58:31.0616] <ljharb>
you can reuse it by sticking ()=> in front of it

[10:05:32.0054] <rbuckton (OOF: 7/5 - 7/16)>
That's not reuse, that's recreating it each time. It also potentially reevaluates each argument, which could have side effects/performance implications. 

[10:07:35.0485] <rbuckton (OOF: 7/5 - 7/16)>
i.e., `const r = () => Number.range(0, f())`. Beginners could easily overlook the `f()`

[10:09:08.0225] <rbuckton (OOF: 7/5 - 7/16)>
Maybe PFA could help, but it's also not something a beginner would likely reach for immediately, nor is the `() =>` trick 

[10:14:22.0364] <zbraniecki>
My mental model is aligned with rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16) - `oneToTen` should produce an iterator when used in a loop. I probably am projecting how Rust does it where `Range` implements `IntoIterator`

[10:20:24.0540] <ljharb>
i don't think beginners will expect to reuse it either tho.

[10:37:54.0187] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
I think beginners are more likely to reuse it than not, just as you could reuse an array, or map, or set, or typed array. This is especially true if we do ever have a range/slice syntax in the future. 

[10:41:08.0250] <rbuckton (PTO: 7/5 - 7/16)>
I'm still of the opinion that the iterator helpers proposal has a very short-sighted view by focusing on Iterator and not Iterable, and I'd rather not repeat the mistake of leveraging the wrong level of abstraction in more places if we can potentially avoid it. That said, Iterator is probably fine for `Number.range()` on its own, but I would be strongly opposed to the same behavior for any potential Range/slice syntax in the future.

sidebar: I am now ~half of the agenda items for the next meeting. hope everyone is prepared to talk about dumb corner cases for an entire meeting.

[11:08:53.0451] <shu>
please cover them on wednesday, when i cannot be there

[11:32:39.0229] <ljharb>
iterable isn‚Äôt a thing, it‚Äôs a trait.

[11:32:57.0609] <ljharb>
whereas an iterator is a thing

I will add an item on Temporal, but unfortunately it's also all dumb corner cases

[12:56:57.0922] <littledan>
Are people thinking of breakout sessions for the upcoming TC39 meeting, given our possibly somewhat light schedule when finally meeting partly in person/hybrid?

 * Are people thinking of breakout sessions for the upcoming TC39 meeting, given our possibly somewhat light schedule when finally meeting partly in person/hybrid?

[12:58:48.0390] <littledan>
I could imagine one breakout session on modules, one on inclusion, and maybe one on Ecma, if people are interested. I imagine that other people may have other interesting topics.

[13:00:18.0055] <jschoi>
(For what it‚Äôs worth, I am still planning to add along with Hemanth H.M three agenda items for a once function, a memoize function, and built-in cache maps/sets, so the agenda will fill up a little more than it is now. I might also fill in more time with some chartered incubator topics that haven‚Äôt yet had their incubator meetings, like Array.fromAsync, BigInt Math, bind-this and pipe/topic. I‚Äôm not sure whether those would be more appropriate as breakout sessions or as ordinary agenda topics.)

[13:01:21.0460] <littledan>
oh yes please keep adding agenda items! those definitely are higher priority than the open-ended discussions I was suggesting.

[13:02:37.0954] <jschoi>
Some of the incubator topics are, for better or for worse, open-ended, especially discussion regarding dataflow syntaxes (including pipe/topic and bind-this). Also, I didn‚Äôt get to mention this at last plenary, but it‚Äôs good to see you again; hope you had a good past year.

[13:02:51.0645] <littledan>
yeah good to see you too!

[13:02:52.0999] <littledan>
I'd suggest that overflow incubator items could be breakout sessions, rather than agenda items

those new proposals sound interesting! they seem like tricky things to make built-in since caches/memoization sometimes have domain-specific retention policies; are you proposing hooks for those?

[13:07:54.0518] <jschoi>
As champion / co-champion of four out of the five chartered incubator items (https://github.com/tc39/incubator-agendas/issues/25), I do not plan to advance any of them next meeting, haha. There‚Äôs just too much contention around them right now. But maybe decorator metadata might be ready‚Ä¶

[13:08:37.0093] <littledan>
of course once should be a template tag, ```once`${f}`(x)``` to take advantage of location-based caching ;)

Oh yeah, that‚Äôs the third proposal: maps and sets with cache-replacement policies, for the sake of memoizing but also other stuff. I‚Äôm undecided whether to bundle memoization with CRP maps/sets into one proposal or not; I think we‚Äôre going to probably separate them.

[13:12:00.0839] <jschoi>
Yeah, it‚Äôs no problem; I think we‚Äôre all very thankful of you managing the incubators. Hopefully we‚Äôll knock some stuff out during plenary.

[13:13:09.0611] <shu>
yes, might be a good one to do it with such a light schedule
