> The IndexedDB API provides a built-in method for comparing two ArrayBuffers or ArrayBuffer views in a bytewise fashion. This is because IndexedDB has a concept of "key order", where a subset of JavaScript values that can be used as "keys" in IndexedDB have a defined sorting order. The important part is that one such kind of key is a binary key, which is defined in the spec as "ArrayBuffer objects (or views on buffers such as Uint8Array)."
