> The IndexedDB API provides a built-in method for comparing two ArrayBuffers or ArrayBuffer views in a bytewise fashion. This is because IndexedDB has a concept of "key order", where a subset of JavaScript values that can be used as "keys" in IndexedDB have a defined sorting order. The important part is that one such kind of key is a binary key, which is defined in the spec as "ArrayBuffer objects (or views on buffers such as Uint8Array)."

I'm unable to attend in person, unfortunately. If there are to be TC39 hats, will there be a way to get one for remote attendees?

[11:58:17.0779] <Rob Palmer>
I don't think we've explicitly said what the swag will be yet? Taking notes and writing summaries will definitely increase the chances of getting some.

[12:01:49.0589] <rbuckton>
Well, swag in general. I have the last two hats, can't let the collection be incomplete.

[12:13:49.0565] <Rob Palmer>
It seems likely there will be enough to bring to future plenaries. 

[13:33:06.0925] <Michael Ficarra>
ah, but do you have the beanie?

Alas, no. I do have the ball caps though

[16:12:34.0830] <rbuckton>
Unfortunately, the next two are outside the US and are outside of my travel budget. Iay have to wait for the next east coast plenary.

Last meeting, which proposals did we agree are at 2.7?

> <@ljharb:matrix.org> Last meeting, which proposals did we agree are at 2.7?

none

[19:16:14.0171] <Chris de Almeida>
the only proposal that could have been regressed was decorator metadata and it was objected to on the grounds that proposals stage changes need to be on the agenda.  in any case, it's moot now because the 2.7 -> 3 criteria was quickly resolved for that proposal, so it remains at stage 3

[19:48:35.0234] <ljharb>
ah ok, gotcha


2024-01-22
[16:11:32.0347] <Michael Ficarra>
to be pedantic, many proposals "qualified" for demotion to stage 2.7, in that their tests may not be deemed sufficient by committee

[16:12:05.0129] <Michael Ficarra>
but I only proposed demotion for proposals that had no tests at all

[16:12:45.0464] <Michael Ficarra>
if somebody wanted to do the work, they could probably make a pretty good case for demotion of a few more stage 3 proposals
