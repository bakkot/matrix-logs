PSA: we just landed a commit on ecma262 which tweaks the formatting, which is the sort of thing which causes a lot of merge conflicts. if you have an in-flight PR and you're rebasing on main, you can avoid manually applying the formatting by using the following series of commands:

```
git rebase -i 0090daf^ # 0090daf is the commit where the formatter is applied
git rebase -X theirs 0090daf --exec "npm i && npm run format && git commit --amend -a --no-edit"
git rebase -i main
```
this splits up the rebase into 1) everything before the formatter was applied, 2) the formatter, which will be done for you, 3) everything after the formatter. any conflicts in parts 1 and 3 you will need to handle manually, just like you would in the absence of the formatter (or feel free to ask the editors for help)

 * yulia: are we unshipping `group`?

[10:49:02.0930] <ljharb>
oof, i hope not - let's at least see if we can fix lastpass first

[10:50:46.0642] <shu>
hm, even if we can i'm still leaning towards unshipping in chrome

[10:51:07.0420] <shu>
because i assume it'll take a while for lastpass's fix to deploy to a large enough % of its customers

[10:53:40.0259] <ljharb>
i'd still want to know what code was breaking on it

[10:54:32.0347] <shu>
+1, the bugzilla comment reads to me as a suspicion, i want to hear it confirmed first

[10:54:53.0377] <shu>
(i mean it sounds likely, but still)

[10:57:37.0180] <yulia>
There is a risk that this may be very hard to catch in codebases, but maybe we just got unlucky with this

[10:58:10.0911] <yulia>
Since chrome is about to ship I didn't think it would be wise to wait on notifying you

[10:58:53.0815] <shu>
indeed, we have a window of a week until i need to request stable respins, which is not good

[10:59:13.0750] <shu>
so much appreciated there

[11:00:29.0058] <shu>
maybe this is the chance to get `groop` after all

[12:12:05.0246] <yulia>
shu: ljharb it... isn't looking good. Two more regressions: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping/issues/44

[12:20:58.0470] <Justin Ridgewell>
Is this the same as that Lego site‚Äôs using an array as a hash map?

[12:59:00.0192] <bakkot>
the cloud.ibm.com one appears to be, though it's different code

[13:41:05.0245] <shu>
yulia: thanks!

[13:41:13.0432] <shu>
alas, i am unshipping this

[14:27:57.0824] <bakkot>
sigh

[14:28:19.0179] <bakkot>
that was the only good other name

[14:30:35.0401] <Michael Ficarra>
there's always `smoosh`

[14:30:49.0364] <shu>
what about `bucket`

[14:30:56.0867] <shu>
or the more provocative `buckit`

[14:31:22.0927] <Michael Ficarra>
`smooshIntoBuckets`

[14:31:25.0190] <shu>
buck it, we're doing 5 groups

[14:33:20.0146] <Kris Kowal>
I has a bucket.

[14:33:57.0715] <shu>
the array-as-hash-table use case makes name picking pretty unpredictable

[14:34:01.0969] <shu>
who knows what keys they're using

[15:56:51.0447] <Justin Ridgewell>
Let's introduce a new meta-object protocol called `getAndApply`, and update `Array.p.group` to:
1. Returned undefined for `get` where the receiver is an array instance
2. Return the function for `get` where the receiver is `Array.prototype`
3. Invokes the method when doing `[].group()` (`getAndApply`)

[15:57:17.0188] <Justin Ridgewell>
Then any new array methods can just be hidden from these terrible sites.


2022-11-08
[16:04:49.0314] <Michael Ficarra>
or.... we just choose a different name

[16:05:09.0039] <Michael Ficarra>
and eventually stop trying to put new things on `Array.prototype`

[16:05:27.0416] <Michael Ficarra>
hopefully one day we can have built-in modules or something and then build out a nice stdlib

[16:05:35.0171] <shu>
yeah i do not think we should introduce a new MOP protocol for this

[16:06:15.0885] <Kris Kowal>
Symbol.facetious

[16:06:23.0783] <bakkot>
quite right, we should use the existing `document.all` protocol

[16:06:59.0102] <Michael Ficarra>
I was waiting for someone to bring up `IsHTMLDDA`

[16:27:02.0402] <Justin Ridgewell>
We pre-scan the source text to see if the word ‚Äúgroup‚Äù appears anywhere, and if so, we do not install the method. Group is only accessible through computed property access were the key is not literally the string ‚Äúgroup‚Äù.

[18:16:00.0900] <Jack Works>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> who knows what keys they're using

maybe the engine need to record names that added to the array happens in Web

[18:18:17.0779] <Jack Works>

and developers need to use it by `array["gro" + "up"]()` right

[18:30:07.0994] <shu>
> <@jackworks:matrix.org> maybe the engine need to record names that added to the array happens in Web

that sounds way too expensive to be feasible

[18:30:12.0909] <shu>
also privacy and fingerprinting concerns?

[00:58:26.0471] <Jack Works>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> that sounds way too expensive to be feasible

I thought the engine was already doing that today, e.g. metrics of Web API usage

[08:07:13.0378] <shu>
those are known counters, they aren't tracking new strings

yulia: is Nightly shipping change-array-by-copy?

[12:33:23.0528] <shu>
`toSorted`, `toSpliced`, and `toReversed` seem unlikely to be used as keys

[12:33:29.0034] <shu>
but i am not so sure about `with`

[12:56:13.0062] <bakkot>
`with` seems a lot less likely than `group`

[13:00:48.0369] <yulia>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> yulia: is Nightly shipping change-array-by-copy?

only behind a build time flag

[13:32:32.0830] <shu>
okay, thanks

[13:32:50.0427] <shu>
i tried looking for the ibm issue and the other issue on the chromium issue tracker and didn't see anything

[13:34:10.0099] <shu>

[13:34:49.0623] <shu>

i agree, guess we'll see

yulia | ü§ï hopefully back in the afternoon: Do you think either you or someone from your organization would have some time in the next few weeks before plenary to discuss Mozilla's position on the Explicit Resource Management proposal?

[06:23:57.0387] <yulia | ü§ï hopefully back in the afternoon>
Sure, we discussed before the last presentation. dminor and I can set something up

[06:24:43.0236] <yulia | ü§ï hopefully back in the afternoon>
before next plenary or? (we will also be in a coruna)

[06:24:50.0387] <rbuckton>
That's fine. As far as scheduling, I'm on the US east coast now. 

[06:25:17.0165] <rbuckton>
Before, if possible. I'd like to be able to advance if that's feasible. 

[06:27:07.0255] <yulia>
ok, i'll set something up

2023 Plenary Schedule is now posted on [the Reflector](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/453).  There's just one date missing that will be confirmed very soon.


2022-11-17
[17:53:12.0244] <shu>
ljharb: you've been vocal in the past about coercing arguments in the order in which they appear. is there code that you've seen that actually depends on that ordering?

[17:53:56.0053] <shu>
i'm thinking of proposing a breaking change to the order of coercion for Atomics methods like `Atomics.store(ta, idx, val)` to coerce idx, val, *then* validate the TA

[17:54:21.0473] <shu>
with resizable buffers, having to recheck detached/out-of-boundness and reloading the length after each argument coercion is really unfortunate

[17:55:18.0726] <shu>
it's kind of a bugfarm (sometimes security bugs)

[18:31:23.0879] <ljharb>
no code i think the committee would respect, I‚Äôd guess. why is it a bug farm?

[18:31:39.0838] <ljharb>
I‚Äôm confused about the problem it‚Äôd be solving

[18:35:48.0758] <Jack Works>
Agree with shu. Don't think coerce order will break anything 

[18:45:03.0984] <shu>
it's a bug farm because it's easy to forget that coercing `idx` and `val` can detach `ta`

[18:45:15.0655] <shu>
(and with resizable buffers, can resize `ta`)

[18:46:03.0551] <shu>
TA detachment and resizing is a qualitatively worse kind of user code than other arbitrary user code, because code that forget to recheck for detachedness after each argument coercion can end up reading out-of-bounds into the buffer, depending on the implementation

[18:46:12.0006] <shu>
 * TA detachment and resizing is a qualitatively worse kind of user code than other arbitrary user code, because code that forget to recheck for detachedness after each argument coercion can end up reading out-of-bounds into the buffer, depending on the implementation

[18:46:20.0487] <Jack Works>
"easy to forget" do you mean when v8 is optimizing code? 

[18:46:41.0711] <shu>
that, and i also mean engineers or spec authors actually forgetting even when implementing the slow path

[18:46:55.0241] <shu>
i personally missed a bunch of these in the resizable buffers spec draft

[18:48:26.0482] <shu>
TA and Atomics methods depend on the TA being in a valid state, life will just be a lot easier if we can rework these methods to 1) validate once instead of multiple times and 2) after validation, check that no user code can ever be called again until method exit

[18:48:59.0753] <shu>
 * TA and Atomics methods depend on the TA being in a valid state, life will just be a lot easier if we can rework these methods to 1) validate once instead of multiple times and 2) after validation, check that no user code can ever be called again until method exit

[18:50:00.0631] <shu>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> I‚Äôm confused about the problem it‚Äôd be solving

what i'm solving for is "increasing likelihood of correct implementation, where incorrect implementation is often a security bug and not just misbehavior"

[18:51:52.0837] <shu>
to be clear, user code re-entrancy is a general problem. i'm singling out TAs because TA bugs result in more, and more serious, security bugs

[18:54:07.0978] <Jack Works>
So the ideal order is: idx check, val check, (no user code now), TA check, Atomics.store, (user code again)?

[18:54:37.0225] <shu>
it's a little trickier than that unfortunately, because `val` coercion depends on looking at whether `ta` is a BigInt TA or a non-BigInt TA

[18:55:02.0921] <shu>
so i think the ideal order is: coerce *but not validate* left-to-right, then validate left-to-right

[18:55:54.0505] <Jack Works>
lgtm

[18:55:56.0734] <shu>
so the order is: 1) ensure `ta` has the right internal slots, 2) coerce `idx`, 3) coerce `val`, (no user code after this point) 4) validate `ta`, 5) validate `idx` (if needed for atomic access)

[18:56:08.0694] <shu>
 * so the order is: 1) ensure `ta` has the right internal slots, 2) coerce `idx`, 3) coerce `val`, (no user code after this point) 4) validate `ta`, 5) validate `idx\` (if needed for atomic access)

[18:56:17.0296] <shu>
 * so the order is: 1) ensure `ta` has the right internal slots, 2) coerce `idx`, 3) coerce `val`, (no user code after this point) 4) validate `ta`, 5) validate `idx` (if needed for atomic access)

[19:45:31.0834] <ljharb>
in general, does anything validate besides TAs and Proxy?

[19:45:40.0016] <ljharb>
* in general, does anything validate besides TAs and Proxy?

[22:50:18.0463] <Richard Gibson>
ljharb: I think that depends upon your definition of "validate". For example, there are six opportunities for [String.prototype.split](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/text-processing.html#sec-string.prototype.split) to throw an exception (and also observably checks arguments out-of-order)‚Äîdoes that count?

[06:52:58.0584] <ljharb>
im trying to understand she‚Äôs mental model here; it‚Äôs probably fine if TA/Proxy is ‚Äúspecial‚Äù but i still don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs not easier to implement correctly if you fully process args left to right

[07:02:48.0197] <Ashley Claymore>
because processing later args can invalidate previous validations

[07:02:55.0893] <Ashley Claymore>
 * because processing later args can invalidate previous validations

[07:30:39.0760] <shu>
ljharb: yeah what Ashley Claymore said. fully left-to-right means you validate `ta`, then validate `idx`, then validate `val`, then need to validate `ta` *again*

[07:31:52.0767] <ljharb>
ahhhhh ok

[07:32:06.0151] <shu>
cause of, you know, `valueOf` and whatnot

[07:32:11.0621] <ljharb>
thanks, that makes sense now, let me think about it

[07:33:17.0256] <shu>
actually in the resizable case it's even dumber

[07:33:36.0960] <shu>
it's validate `ta`, validate `idx`, validate `val`, re-validate `ta`, then also re-validate `idx` because `ta` might not be out of bounds but just shrunk a little bit

[07:34:38.0561] <Ashley Claymore>
`while (somethingCouldChange) validateArgs(...args)`

[08:32:27.0243] <yulia>
rbuckton: just checking, did you see my invite for today?

[08:33:45.0873] <rbuckton>
I did not, no.

[11:34:21.0193] <ljharb>
shu: so, generally i think of "processing" arguments left to right - not necessarily validating them. meaning, i'd maybe expect something like:
1. ensure `ta` is a Typed Array
2. coerce `idx` to a number
3. coerce `val` to whatever it needs to be, if any
4. throw if TA is out of bounds or detached or whatever
5. if needed, validate `val`

thoughts on that?

[11:53:00.0201] <shu>
yes that seems to match what i said above about an "ideal order"

[11:53:11.0321] <shu>
coerce left-to-right, then validate left-to-right

[11:53:18.0486] <shu>
where "coerce" is the phase that can call user code

[11:53:33.0964] <shu>
right now we don't have such a distinction, and we do both at the same time

[11:58:21.0079] <ljharb>
right. my earlier question is because i suspect most things don't actually need to "validate" (or at least, don't need to validate something that could be changed by user code post-coercion), so it doesn't come up often

[12:00:51.0057] <shu>
yeah

[12:01:16.0203] <shu>
so it sounds like you're amenable to having distinct phases like that?

[12:01:20.0671] <shu>
(if web compatible, of course)

[12:03:12.0560] <ljharb>
tentatively yes, i'd just want to make sure there's no weird cases that would arise from applying that rule universally (which might be fine ofc, but it's hard to know in advance)

[12:03:27.0957] <ljharb>
 * tentatively yes, i'd just want to make sure there's no weird cases that would arise from applying that rule universally (which might be fine ofc, but it's hard to know in advance)

[12:11:35.0350] <shu>
i wasn't planning on applying it universally

[12:12:03.0409] <shu>
though i suspect you are right that basically only TAs (and DataViews) and proxies even have a sense of "valid state" at all

[12:12:23.0110] <shu>
but i only really care about TAs and DataViews

does anyone know how i could detach an arraybuffer in an env without postMessage or structuredClone? (non-latest node, essentially)

[15:28:35.0002] <Ashley Claymore>
Maybe via webassembly APIs? Or is that also too new? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/Memory/grow

ljharb: node has supported postMessage for a long time; how old a node are you talking?

[17:54:06.0956] <bakkot>
(there isn't anything in the language itself, so it'll depend on what exactly your host provides)

[20:38:54.0241] <ljharb>
um, even node 19 doesn't have postMessage?

[20:39:46.0947] <ljharb>
 * um, even node 19 doesn't have postMessage?

[20:40:14.0621] <ljharb>
i mean, atm i have no solution in node at all, so wasm would be something

[20:40:59.0689] <ljharb>
node 0.5 has ArrayBuffer at least, so, as old as possible :-)

[00:23:58.0059] <bakkot>
ljharb: ah, sorry, it does but it's hard to get to

[00:24:02.0586] <bakkot>
`(new (require('worker_threads').MessageChannel)).port1.postMessage(null, [y.buffer])`

[00:26:35.0286] <bakkot>
works in 12 but not 10, but there might be a different way of getting at MessageChannel on older versions

[00:30:56.0060] <bakkot>
hm, no, nothing else I can see from a quick glance at https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v10.x/api/all.html

[00:31:03.0376] <bakkot>
so might not be something you can do in nodes older than 12

[00:31:15.0468] <bakkot>
(or 10 with --experimental-workers)

[09:30:51.0371] <ljharb>
thanks tho, that still helps a lot

[04:26:06.0191] <Rob Palmer>
There is at least one trip planned for next year. September 26-28 is the Tokyo plenary. So far we do not have a community event planned. If you have contacts, that would be helpful.

indeed! Yosuke Furukawa is the main organizer for JSConf JP so I think he may be able to help us (IIRC littledan was even talking with him pre-pandemic about community outreach)

This week's plenary meeting will be very busy. It is also on CEST (Madrid time) which is super early for US timezone folk.

We have more content than time available. Please consider if you think any agenda items you own could use less time, or could be deprioritized, and then PR the agenda accordingly.

FWIW, I _have_ thought about it.  (I'm still basically a newbie here.)  I had requested 30 minutes: 10 for my talk and 20 for discussion, as I hope for advancing my Mass Proxy Revocation proposal to stage 1.  I don't have a feel for how these votes go.  Even if I gave up half the discussion time, that really wouldn't buy very much.

Kris Kowal: 20 minutes for the Module Harmony discussion seems wildly optimistic

[13:23:47.0824] <bakkot>
looking forward to it though

[13:40:39.0258] <Rob Palmer>
Hey all, we have an unusually large number of personal scheduling constraints for this meeting. This is making it hard to create a viable schedule. The chairs will be reaching out to those affected. 

If you are able to relax your constraints, please do so. It also helps if you can clarify where something is a *weak*preference vs a hard constraint by PRing the agenda.

[14:45:40.0543] <Andrew Brown>
Just to confirm since it's my first time attending: this channel will have a Jitsi URL posted somewhere once the meeting starts tomorrow?

[14:46:00.0042] <ryzokuken>
Andrew Brown: there's a sign-up form for the call link

[14:46:17.0351] <Andrew Brown>
Can you point me to it?

[14:50:01.0273] <ryzokuken>
you're right, there is indeed no link yet in the reflector

[14:50:15.0144] <ryzokuken>
we will send a link to the sign-up form before the meeting

[15:03:38.0111] <ryzokuken>
draft schedule is up! link in the reflector.

[00:26:47.0914] <littledan>
Are we getting the video conference signup link?

[00:27:49.0101] <littledan>
I take it the meeting starts in half an hour. I don‚Äôt see it on the Reflector

[00:40:38.0502] <Rob Palmer>
It was posted on the Reflector 30mins ago.  Please refresh.

[00:44:11.0167] <Rob Palmer>
We are now admitting people to the Google Meet.  Please use Incognito/Private browsing mode - because that will allow you to specify your name.  So you can call yourself "Name (Affiliation)".

[00:59:00.0140] <Rob Palmer>
We will begin the meeting in one minute!

[00:59:21.0130] <Rob Palmer>
If anyone has any troubles dialling in, please say here.

[01:00:10.0351] <yulia>
Is tcq not working for anyone else?

[01:00:14.0457] <yulia>
I get meeting not available

[01:00:33.0478] <Alex Vincent>
try reloading the page - that worked for me yulia

[01:01:34.0132] <yulia>
I still get meeting not found. should it be TKTK or is the meeting id different?

[01:01:45.0693] <Rob Palmer>
The signin form is available on the Reflector - please can all in-person attendees fill it out too:  https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/446

[01:02:41.0463] <Rob Palmer>
I just fixed the TCQ link on the draft schedule

[01:02:50.0593] <Alex Vincent>
hm, maybe I'd opened it as a fresh link from the Reflector issue

[01:03:00.0879] <rkirsling>
is it an obligation for the host to have a second CoC in play? obviously not a problem if they do have one, but somehow I don't have a recollection of that before

[01:03:04.0405] <yulia>
Found it -- the link is different than the text

[01:03:18.0271] <Robert Pamely>
Is it viable to turn off the lights above the projection screen?

[01:03:28.0929] <Robert Pamely>
Are those lights independent?

[01:03:40.0980] <rkirsling>

[01:05:38.0645] <Rob Palmer>
Romulo Cintra: Can you help with lights?

[01:07:01.0825] <Rob Palmer>
Thank you Jason and Ashley and Kevin for volunteering for notes!

[01:07:20.0538] <bakkot>
btw the bot is using a new language model, which hopefully is better

[01:07:22.0404] <bakkot>
we'll see though

[01:07:28.0603] <Romulo Cintra>

?

[01:08:06.0157] <Christian Ulbrich>
Romulo Cintra: Thx!

[01:08:06.0852] <Robert Pamely>
Thank you

[01:08:07.0861] <jasew>
That's much better

[01:08:22.0269] <Rob Palmer>
The room is now is dark mode, which helps us to see the projector screen.

Why is the "attendees" section in the notes only for remote people? Having the abbreviations there helps also for in-person attendees

[01:09:23.0534] <Rob Palmer>
it should be for both

[01:10:16.0214] <msaboff>
Please add your name, abbreviation and organization to the attendees section of the notes (each day).

[01:12:06.0207] <Justin Ridgewell>
Rob Palmer: I can't find the sign in form for remote attendees

[01:12:17.0823] <Justin Ridgewell>
Only the in person form

[01:12:20.0710] <ryzokuken>
Justin Ridgewell: it's on the reflector

[01:12:24.0321] <ryzokuken>
please refresh

[01:12:37.0698] <Justin Ridgewell>
I did...

[01:12:41.0617] <ryzokuken>
it was added a short while ago, you might have the old page loaded

[01:13:02.0412] <Rob Palmer>
It's in the video link section

[01:13:22.0226] <Justin Ridgewell>
Ahh, got it

[01:13:30.0800] <Justin Ridgewell>
It's tooooooo early.

[01:14:04.0252] <pipobscure>
BTW TCQ seems to still be on the Welcome/Intro

[01:14:52.0711] <jasew>

this was a non-rhetorical question re: hosting, btw

[01:48:19.0575] <waldemar>
Is there a list of in-person attendees that the remote folks can see?

[01:48:31.0819] <waldemar>
I can't tell who is in the room at the moment

[01:49:12.0029] <Rob Palmer>
Waldermar, I'll update the notes doc to ensure in-person attendees are listed
