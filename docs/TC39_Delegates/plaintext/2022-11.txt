PSA: we just landed a commit on ecma262 which tweaks the formatting, which is the sort of thing which causes a lot of merge conflicts. if you have an in-flight PR and you're rebasing on main, you can avoid manually applying the formatting by using the following series of commands:

```
git rebase -i 0090daf^ # 0090daf is the commit where the formatter is applied
git rebase -X theirs 0090daf --exec "npm i && npm run format && git commit --amend -a --no-edit"
git rebase -i main
```
this splits up the rebase into 1) everything before the formatter was applied, 2) the formatter, which will be done for you, 3) everything after the formatter. any conflicts in parts 1 and 3 you will need to handle manually, just like you would in the absence of the formatter (or feel free to ask the editors for help)

yulia: are we unshipping `group`?

 * yulia: are we unshipping `group`?

[10:49:02.0930] <ljharb>
oof, i hope not - let's at least see if we can fix lastpass first

[10:50:46.0642] <shu>
hm, even if we can i'm still leaning towards unshipping in chrome

[10:51:07.0420] <shu>
because i assume it'll take a while for lastpass's fix to deploy to a large enough % of its customers

[10:53:40.0259] <ljharb>
i'd still want to know what code was breaking on it

[10:54:32.0347] <shu>
+1, the bugzilla comment reads to me as a suspicion, i want to hear it confirmed first

[10:54:53.0377] <shu>
(i mean it sounds likely, but still)

[10:57:37.0180] <yulia>
There is a risk that this may be very hard to catch in codebases, but maybe we just got unlucky with this

[10:58:10.0911] <yulia>
Since chrome is about to ship I didn't think it would be wise to wait on notifying you

[10:58:53.0815] <shu>
indeed, we have a window of a week until i need to request stable respins, which is not good

[10:59:13.0750] <shu>
so much appreciated there

[11:00:29.0058] <shu>
maybe this is the chance to get `groop` after all

[12:12:05.0246] <yulia>
shu: ljharb it... isn't looking good. Two more regressions: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping/issues/44

Is this the same as that Lego siteâ€™s using an array as a hash map?

[12:59:00.0192] <bakkot>
the cloud.ibm.com one appears to be, though it's different code

[13:41:05.0245] <shu>
yulia: thanks!

[13:41:13.0432] <shu>
alas, i am unshipping this

[14:27:57.0824] <bakkot>
sigh

[14:28:19.0179] <bakkot>
that was the only good other name
