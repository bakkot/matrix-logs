i hope Temporal will be able to support the moon https://www.reuters.com/science/white-house-directs-nasa-create-time-standard-moon-2024-04-02/

That is a clear use case for sub-microsecond precision

we'll need a v2 of Temporal where we specify the astronomical "home base" object. CLDR will need to be extended with a new catalog of astronomical objects and new lunar time zones. Should be doable!

make sure you never end up with a home base inside a black hole

maybe this time we can get it right and agree to use timex time (100 second minutes, 100 minute hours) on the moon

what I learned from researching the moon standard time in the past couple of days, is that local gravity affects the rate at which atomic clocks tick. Earth's atomic time is the average of several dozen atomic clocks, all with gravitational corrections applied so that they are effectively ticking at mean sea level (even if the clock itself is physically far above sea level)
