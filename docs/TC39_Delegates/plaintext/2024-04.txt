i hope Temporal will be able to support the moon https://www.reuters.com/science/white-house-directs-nasa-create-time-standard-moon-2024-04-02/

[07:17:02.0068] <nicolo-ribaudo>
That is a clear use case for sub-microsecond precision

[07:21:24.0968] <Jesse>
we'll need a v2 of Temporal where we specify the astronomical "home base" object. CLDR will need to be extended with a new catalog of astronomical objects and new lunar time zones. Should be doable!

[07:22:01.0255] <Andreu Botella>
make sure you never end up with a home base inside a black hole

[07:25:47.0132] <Jesse>
maybe this time we can get it right and agree to use timex time (100 second minutes, 100 minute hours) on the moon

[07:30:17.0337] <Jesse>
 * we'll need a v2 of Temporal where we specify the astronomical "home base" object for all operations. CLDR will need to be extended with a new catalog of astronomical objects and new lunar time zones. Should be doable!

[12:23:57.0519] <ptomato>
what I learned from researching the moon standard time in the past couple of days, is that local gravity affects the rate at which atomic clocks tick. Earth's atomic time is the average of several dozen atomic clocks, all with gravitational corrections applied so that they are effectively ticking at mean sea level (even if the clock itself is physically far above sea level)

[12:34:03.0904] <TabAtkins>
Yup, that's relativity for you. Gravity affects the rate time passes.

[12:34:36.0407] <bakkot>
yeah it's not just that it affects the rate at which the clocks tick, it's that it affects the rate at which _everything_ ticks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation

[12:35:20.0711] <bakkot>
looking forward to Temporal being updated to include a "strength of local gravity" parameter :D

[12:38:07.0627] <ptomato>
right, so I'm a bit skeptical about whether it makes any sense to stretch the definition of POSIX time to incorporate other astronomical bodies

[13:56:02.0800] <Chris de Almeida>
gentle reminder to please add any and all plenary schedule constraints as soon as possible

[14:45:50.0407] <TabAtkins>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> looking forward to Temporal being updated to include a "strength of local gravity" parameter :D

"velocity relative to timebase station", too

[14:46:24.0570] <bakkot>
if we're doing velocity we need acceleration and jerk and so on as well, so we can properly represent dates in the future

[14:46:37.0262] <bakkot>
really just a full PDE I figure

[17:19:11.0869] <waldemar>
The current time systems in common use are only really designed to work on the surface of the Earth. Astronomers and other space scientists use different time systems which account for relativistic effects such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_Dynamical_Time

[17:21:00.0409] <waldemar>
One of my favorite papers is measuring the masses of various solar system bodies such as Saturn using nothing more than clocks, comparing earthbound clocks to clocks outside the solar system (in the form of distant pulsars): https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3607

[17:24:04.0707] <waldemar>
The approach of counting seconds won't work well after we expand into space because clocks tick at different rates in different places in the solar system. If you want everyone to stay synced to Earth time, you'll need to adjust the duration of the second depending on where you are. If you want to keep the SI definition of a second, clocks in various places will diverge over time.

[17:25:16.0778] <waldemar>
We already have that issue with spacecraft, but the scientists and engineers working them account for the differences.

I joined the call anonymously (no prior log in)

[07:03:46.0202] <bakkot>
you do not have to use the client

ooohh we're bringing WinterCG into Ecma?

[07:21:35.0040] <littledan>
yep!

[07:21:40.0316] <ryzokuken>
WinterTC

[07:21:42.0628] <Michael Ficarra>
I imagine it won't continue to be called WinterCG?

[07:22:02.0902] <littledan>
More context: https://github.com/wintercg/admin/issues/58

[07:22:28.0541] <littledan>
The W3C CG will be the main place for technical development; WinterTC will be more for validation and formal standardization (this mirrors CycloneDX)

[07:25:15.0098] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Are temp checks an official vote?

[07:25:21.0423] <littledan>
no

[07:25:26.0632] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It's weird that voting rules apply to temp checks 

[07:26:05.0675] <littledan>
yes, I agree. I think these Ecma rules only apply directly to official votes, which we do not have. That said, I'm not sure if IEs should be able to block.

[07:26:09.0848] <ljharb>
they're def not votes

[07:26:35.0227] <littledan>
calling for consensus on advancement might be thought of as an implicit vote

[07:26:39.0873] <littledan>
but temperature checks certainly aren't fotes

[07:26:43.0137] <littledan>
 * but temperature checks certainly aren't votes

[07:26:44.0160] <Michael Ficarra>
IEs definitely should not be voting/blocking

[07:26:48.0579] <ljharb>
IEs not being able to participate in consensus would be a radical change from the way tc39 has always operated, so that'd be something that needs discussion

[07:27:02.0636] <shu>
IEs should not be able to veto

[07:27:08.0299] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> IEs not being able to participate in consensus would be a radical change from the way tc39 has always operated, so that'd be something that needs discussion

OK, let's have this discussion now with Samina

[07:27:13.0942] <littledan>
in the queue

[07:27:55.0522] <ljharb>
about temp checks sure. but ecma rules aren't really relevant; IEs participate in consensus here, and we'd need an agenda item to get consensus on changing that.

[07:31:40.0124] <ljharb>
shu: "being an IE" is at the discretion of chairs and ecma, so if that were ever abused it would be pretty easy to shut it down

[07:32:48.0877] <eemeli>
Does consensus for stage advancement count as a "vote" in ECMA terms?

[07:33:08.0900] <shu>
imo yes?

[07:33:25.0901] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I think so

[07:33:26.0192] <ljharb>
no

[07:33:27.0989] <shu>
like i don't see why there would be any bylaws if any TC can also just say "actually we don't do that"?

[07:33:33.0498] <ljharb>
it's consensus. not a ote.

[07:33:34.0769] <ljharb>
 * it's consensus. not a vote.

[07:33:43.0685] <ljharb>
if it was a vote than we wouldn't ask individuals, we'd ask members.

[07:33:50.0747] <nicolo-ribaudo>
And we informally agree that the chairs only ask for the vote if there is would be full consensus

[07:34:00.0218] <shu>
i strongly disagree

[07:34:04.0350] <ljharb>
for example, google having 30 delegates would still only get 1 response to a call for consensus. that's not how we operate.

[07:34:19.0368] <littledan>
there has long been disagreement within the committee about what the policy is. It's good for this to be on the table for discussion.

[07:35:06.0618] <ljharb>
 * for example, google having 30 delegates would still only get 1 response to a call for consensus. that's not how we operate, or have literally ever operated.

[07:35:28.0730] <nicolo-ribaudo>
 * And we informally agree that the champions only ask for the vote if there is would be full consensus

[07:35:39.0534] <nicolo-ribaudo>
 * And we informally agree that the champions only "ask for the vote" if there is would be full consensus anyway, so no vote needed

[07:35:45.0497] <ljharb>
it's fine to discuss it, and if someone would like to, it'd be great to add an agenda item for it. but making a change here would be dramatic and unprecedented for tc39, and isn't a matter of simply "interpreting bylaws".

[07:35:47.0564] <eemeli>
It would be Really Good for execom to explicitly comment on our consensus practices.

[07:36:13.0061] <littledan>
good reminder from @ljharb on GitHub teams, and thank you for your good work on setting up the GitHub teams. I do want to note that we have some inconsistencies between the GitHub and Ecma data (which member organizations have provided to Ecma and are published in the Ecma memento) and we will need to work through these. I believe neither one of these is perfectly up to date, and we will make a lot of progress by reconciling them.

[07:36:30.0673] <ljharb>
in general, laws serve the people, so if the bylaws conflict with what we actually do, the bylaws, not us, should change.

[07:37:22.0954] <littledan>
> <@eemeli:mozilla.org> It would be Really Good for execom to explicitly comment on our consensus practices.

In general, the ExeCom and Ecma management are very happy with TC39's "self-governance" and don't want to intervene too much. Ecma folks have previously said that they are happy with consensus-based processes like ours, but have found our way of dealing with vetos as absolute to be a bit much.

[07:37:29.0948] <ljharb>
 * in general, laws serve the people, so if the bylaws conflict with what committees actually do, the bylaws, not us, should change.

[07:39:42.0536] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> in general, laws serve the people, so if the bylaws conflict with what committees actually do, the bylaws, not us, should change.

Yes, I very strongly agree with you that we should be thoughtful about any change to TC39's practices and not just blindly apply rules/bylaws, but consider whether they need to be changed if they don't fit, and submit such changes to the Ecma GA for a vote [in practice, consensus there too]. That said, the committee has long contained multiple opinions about whether IEs can block, so it's not clear what the change would/should be. Ecma rules are still set by the GA and not by TC39 precedent.

[07:40:06.0634] <littledan>
I mean, this is why I got involved in Ecma stuff in the first place, to ensure that we had an IE policy in the first place and that we didn't accidentally kick Babel etc out

[07:42:21.0294] <eemeli>
littledan: Does "a bit much" mean that there's an expectation for us to change something at some point, or that the divergence from expectations is small enough to ignore?

[07:43:36.0431] <ljharb>
i mean sure, but opinions that differ from 100% of past history don't change what's actually happened

[07:44:02.0808] <ljharb>
it's fine to believe IEs shouldn't participate in consensus, for example, but that's only relevant in a discussion about whether to change the fact that they do :-)

[07:45:10.0345] <ljharb>
 * it's fine to believe IEs shouldn't participate in consensus, for example, but that's only relevant in a discussion about whether to change the fact that they do :-) (which is also fine to have, ofc)

[07:50:01.0990] <littledan>
> <@eemeli:mozilla.org> littledan: Does "a bit much" mean that there's an expectation for us to change something at some point, or that the divergence from expectations is small enough to ignore?

No, there is no expectation that we change anything; they respect our self-management here and don't want to excessively intervene.

[07:50:38.0182] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> i mean sure, but opinions that differ from 100% of past history don't change what's actually happened

in past incidents of IEs blocking, IMO there is ambiguity as to whether the IE actually executed a block, or whether the IE expressed a strong negative opinion and the champion withdrew the request for advancement.

[07:51:18.0335] <ljharb>
there's no such thing as "block". there's either consensus for something, or not

[07:51:19.0727] <littledan>
IEs are definitely here to participate actively in all technical discussions, and express strong negative opinions when there's a request for consensus, no doubt about that. If they make a good argument, they won't be the only blocker, so this is probably not a very impactful decision.

> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> it'd be nice if the CoC update included what actions were taken (if any) instead of just saying "it's been resolved"

per the Code of Conduct:  

> The Committee will never publicly discuss the issueÕæ all public statements, if needed, will be made by the TC39 Chair and/or the Ecma Secretariat.

[08:55:37.0682] <Michael Ficarra>
telling us what actions were taken (like somebody being banned from a particular forum) is not discussing the issue IMO

[08:58:53.0469] <littledan>
The CoC committee could refer more public statements to the chair or secretariat for disclosure. Overall I think we have enough experience that statements like, "there was a report, it was handled" don't really make all of TC39 feel more secure about the process. But maybe we should just trust the CoC committee, and even these notifications are unnecessary--confidentiality is really important to preserve.

[08:59:21.0144] <shu>
yeah i think if you want to be confidential just don't update

[08:59:31.0979] <shu>
100% confidential, that is

[09:00:38.0215] <Chris de Almeida>
depending on the action taken, saying what that action was may have privacy risk

[09:00:45.0184] <ryzokuken>
there's no harm in evolving our CoC processes in order to better serve delegates and make everyone feel more secure about our working environment here

[09:10:07.0761] <Chris de Almeida>
it's up to TC39 what the CoC is and how the CoC committee reports back to TC39 and the ExeCom/GA. if folks want to change the CoC, that's fine. it needs to be raised and get consensus at plenary, and I think Ecma ExeCom also would need to support if I'm not mistaken

[09:11:13.0487] <Chris de Almeida>
 * it's up to TC39 what the CoC is and how the CoC committee reports back to TC39 and the ExeCom/GA. if folks want to change the CoC, that's fine. it needs to be raised and get consensus at plenary

[09:22:37.0997] <littledan>
Definitely needs an agenda item to draw a conclusion; this is just some earlier discussion/feedback, which is also valid (like our above discussion about Ecma rules despite this not being a GA meeting). The CoC committee could also be the ones to propose something to plenary, based on this kind of feedback.

[09:33:14.0276] <Chris de Almeida>
you're absolutely right. I want to be clear it's not a matter the CoC committee can unilaterally decide

[09:40:03.0157] <littledan>
About blocks: IMO IEs should generally be able to operate equally to all other committee delegates, and the process focus should probably be more on, what can we do in response to someone (anyone) blocking, and whether the committee may still have general consensus (e.g., by establishing that general consensus at a follow-on meeting once we all have more time to consider things).

[10:06:38.0293] <bakkot>
I don't know that "I would prefer to work with arrays" is... really an answer to "what is the benefit"?

[10:13:14.0896] <littledan>

i mean i also to prefer to work with arrays when cache locality matters

[10:14:53.0769] <shu>
but i don't know if i care about it for joint iteration in particular

[10:15:14.0243] <shu>
and "caring about cache locality" certainly argues for case-by-case for the operation, not a catch-all

[10:15:26.0619] <ljharb>
to be clear i'm not arguing for 100% symmetry

FYI I consider take/drop to be the analogue to slice @nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org @bakkot:matrix.org

they're certainly similar, just not identical

I would like us to explicitly have a policy that we don't use "this package has many downloads" as a reason to add a feature

[10:20:59.0442] <bakkot>
"this package has many dependents from different authors", sure

(in this case, the package has a dependency of Jest)

yeah i was more saying, this is empirical evidence that the original belief is false

[10:21:54.0495] <ljharb>
(that everybody would prefer an aiife)

ok

tbc, the closest analogy is `new Promise(r => r(foo, ...args))`, not a try-catch

"Not bad, but not convinced that it's useful"

Promise.prototype.catch/finally are really different from Promise.try...

[10:30:26.0888] <shu>
we have spent more time talking about the check than just doing the check

[10:31:17.0288] <tkopp>
I like the hoisting of a sometimes promised function into a definite promise.
It helps decluttering functional chaining.

[10:31:59.0561] <ptomato>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> we have spent more time talking about the check than just doing the check

we do that every time. but temperature checks are rare. if they were more common, I think we wouldn't have to talk about them so much

[10:34:06.0303] <danielrosenwasser>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> Promise.prototype.catch/finally are really different from Promise.try...

could you say more about what the big differences are?

[10:34:52.0945] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Temp polls should have a symmetrical state, going from Strong Positive to Strong Negative

[10:36:06.0616] <littledan>
I voted "indifferent" based on agreeing with what Nicolo said. The intended meaning is not "abstain"

[10:37:12.0071] <bakkot>
"very weak negative" is how I intended my "indifferent"

[10:37:23.0817] <danielrosenwasser>
I assumed "üëÄ" was abstain

[10:37:39.0733] <waldemar>
Indifferent indicates that you had time to consider the issue and vote. 

[10:38:03.0075] <waldemar>
Indifferent has no negative connotations to me.

[10:38:28.0604] <waldemar>
Without "indifferent" it would be hard to tell if people had a chance to vote.

[10:38:33.0136] <littledan>
communication is all about relationships and context, and not only absolute meanings of words

[10:39:14.0024] <littledan>
here, several people explicitly clarified that they specifically meant "very weak negative", so it doesn't really matter if "indifferent" generally has no negative connotations

[10:39:22.0218] <littledan>
anyway it has Stage 2.7 so this is closed, I think

[10:39:31.0287] <bakkot>
I guess given that we would not advance a proposal unless at least some people were strongly positive, and that "very weak negative" is "I don't object to advancement", there's not much practical difference between the two

[10:40:09.0667] <littledan>
in this case, yes

[10:40:23.0112] <Chris de Almeida>
more of an aside, but we regularly change the semantics of what the temp check options are because they don't always align well with the question

[10:40:25.0642] <littledan>
I did want to elicit some more positive/strongly positive feedback, which we did get

[10:42:13.0844] <Michael Ficarra>
just a backslash wouldn't work anyway since we got rid of identity escapes

[10:42:30.0766] <Michael Ficarra>
so it'd be replacing the first character with an escape sequence for that character, like a hex escape

[10:42:39.0129] <Michael Ficarra>
if this is even needed, which I don't believe it is

[10:44:33.0107] <littledan>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> Temp polls should have a symmetrical state, going from Strong Positive to Strong Negative

I think this choice was deliberate because it was trying to avoid negativity, but after a couple years of experience, it doesn't seem like that design worked. I like the idea of a basically 1-5 symmetrical scale; the other options don't seem to be very easy to interpret.

[10:44:58.0284] <littledan>
and in particular, temperature checks were designed to avoid, well, this kind of vote as a use case, to be honest

please no, please get rid of some options at the same time

[10:47:37.0849] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Who should take the fall, "Strongly positive" or "Following"

[10:47:59.0219] <ljharb>
following

[10:48:03.0667] <ptomato>
following. has anyone ever voted following

[10:48:31.0037] <Michael Ficarra>
following for sure

[10:49:18.0624] <littledan>
So "unconvinced" is weakly negative, and "negative" is strongly negative? Should we rename the options to be symmetrical?

[10:49:24.0508] <Michael Ficarra>
also confused because if you're confused, you should be asking for clarification, not voting!

[10:49:44.0896] <littledan>
I guess in this case, "unconvinced" being the strongest negative option makes it scary to vote for

[10:50:03.0976] <littledan>
no, confused is good, we should keep it--it's a big problem if people are confused and afraid to ask!

[10:50:43.0771] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I think calling it unconvinced is more expressive than "weakly negative"

[10:51:04.0400] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Or "This temperature check has been worded terribly I don't know what I'm voting" üòõ

[10:51:07.0151] <littledan>
OK, I'm convinced :)

[10:51:15.0439] <nicolo-ribaudo>
 * Or "This temperature check has been worded terribly I don't understand what the options mean in this case" üòõ

[10:51:25.0428] <littledan>
the most important thing is to have something stronger than unconvinced, so that unconvinced becomes less harsh, I think

Ughh I just noticed that I forgot to add slides to one of my topics on the agenda (a status update)

this is enough change in the proposal that, even Wednesday, I don't think I'd be prepared to advance to 2.7

 * Ughh I just noticed that I forgot to add slides to one of my topics on the agenda (a status update) -- I'm sorry

100% agreed

maybe with just one of these changes, but with 2 or 3 i'd rather wait

[10:58:50.0013] <Michael Ficarra>
to be clear, I think they're all good improvements, but I'd want to review it as a whole again

[11:00:31.0247] <ljharb>
yep, i've unchecked all the signoffs so i know to re-ask

[11:00:42.0656] <ljharb>
btw for the steno, can we get them to stop double spacing after periods?

[11:01:18.0285] <Michael Ficarra>
they're also inserting newlines at the page width instead of letting it wrap üò≠

[11:02:17.0713] <nicolo-ribaudo>
"Can you please set your line width to 100_000_000?"

[11:02:43.0350] <ljharb>
both of those, yes please

[11:03:15.0141] <littledan>
we've asked the stenographers to do this before. They should be doing it. I'll call them today.

[11:03:27.0536] <littledan>
They've fixed this in the past, it's just that not all of them do it

[11:25:27.0279] <bakkot>
waldemar: On the topic of RegExp escapes, what escaping do you think we ought to use for null bytes? We have `\0`, but `\x00` is plenty readable, and `\0` has the complication that you can't use it if the next character is an ASCII digit. My inclination is to use `\x00`.
