i hope Temporal will be able to support the moon https://www.reuters.com/science/white-house-directs-nasa-create-time-standard-moon-2024-04-02/

That is a clear use case for sub-microsecond precision

[07:21:24.0968] <Jesse>
we'll need a v2 of Temporal where we specify the astronomical "home base" object. CLDR will need to be extended with a new catalog of astronomical objects and new lunar time zones. Should be doable!

[07:22:01.0255] <Andreu Botella>
make sure you never end up with a home base inside a black hole

[07:25:47.0132] <Jesse>
maybe this time we can get it right and agree to use timex time (100 second minutes, 100 minute hours) on the moon

what I learned from researching the moon standard time in the past couple of days, is that local gravity affects the rate at which atomic clocks tick. Earth's atomic time is the average of several dozen atomic clocks, all with gravitational corrections applied so that they are effectively ticking at mean sea level (even if the clock itself is physically far above sea level)

[12:34:03.0904] <TabAtkins>
Yup, that's relativity for you. Gravity affects the rate time passes.

[12:34:36.0407] <bakkot>
yeah it's not just that it affects the rate at which the clocks tick, it's that it affects the rate at which _everything_ ticks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation

[12:35:20.0711] <bakkot>
looking forward to Temporal being updated to include a "strength of local gravity" parameter :D

[12:38:07.0627] <ptomato>
right, so I'm a bit skeptical about whether it makes any sense to stretch the definition of POSIX time to incorporate other astronomical bodies

[13:56:02.0800] <Chris de Almeida>
gentle reminder to please add any and all plenary schedule constraints as soon as possible

"velocity relative to timebase station", too

[14:46:24.0570] <bakkot>
if we're doing velocity we need acceleration and jerk and so on as well, so we can properly represent dates in the future

[14:46:37.0262] <bakkot>
really just a full PDE I figure

[14:52:33.0535] <Andreu Botella>
the curvature of the entire universe too

[14:57:37.0525] <shu>
what the fuck

The current time systems in common use are only really designed to work on the surface of the Earth. Astronomers and other space scientists use different time systems which account for relativistic effects such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_Dynamical_Time

[17:21:00.0409] <waldemar>
One of my favorite papers is measuring the masses of various solar system bodies such as Saturn using nothing more than clocks, comparing earthbound clocks to clocks outside the solar system (in the form of distant pulsars): https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3607

[17:24:04.0707] <waldemar>
The approach of counting seconds won't work well after we expand into space because clocks tick at different rates in different places in the solar system. If you want everyone to stay synced to Earth time, you'll need to adjust the duration of the second depending on where you are. If you want to keep the SI definition of a second, clocks in various places will diverge over time.

[17:25:16.0778] <waldemar>
We already have that issue with spacecraft, but the scientists and engineers working them account for the differences.
