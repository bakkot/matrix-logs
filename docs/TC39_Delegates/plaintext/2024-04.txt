i hope Temporal will be able to support the moon https://www.reuters.com/science/white-house-directs-nasa-create-time-standard-moon-2024-04-02/

[07:17:02.0068] <nicolo-ribaudo>
That is a clear use case for sub-microsecond precision

[07:21:24.0968] <Jesse>
we'll need a v2 of Temporal where we specify the astronomical "home base" object. CLDR will need to be extended with a new catalog of astronomical objects and new lunar time zones. Should be doable!

[07:22:01.0255] <Andreu Botella>
make sure you never end up with a home base inside a black hole

[07:25:47.0132] <Jesse>
maybe this time we can get it right and agree to use timex time (100 second minutes, 100 minute hours) on the moon

[07:30:17.0337] <Jesse>

what I learned from researching the moon standard time in the past couple of days, is that local gravity affects the rate at which atomic clocks tick. Earth's atomic time is the average of several dozen atomic clocks, all with gravitational corrections applied so that they are effectively ticking at mean sea level (even if the clock itself is physically far above sea level)

[12:34:03.0904] <TabAtkins>
Yup, that's relativity for you. Gravity affects the rate time passes.

[12:34:36.0407] <bakkot>
yeah it's not just that it affects the rate at which the clocks tick, it's that it affects the rate at which _everything_ ticks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation

[12:35:20.0711] <bakkot>
looking forward to Temporal being updated to include a "strength of local gravity" parameter :D

[12:38:07.0627] <ptomato>
right, so I'm a bit skeptical about whether it makes any sense to stretch the definition of POSIX time to incorporate other astronomical bodies

[13:56:02.0800] <Chris de Almeida>
gentle reminder to please add any and all plenary schedule constraints as soon as possible

[14:45:50.0407] <TabAtkins>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> looking forward to Temporal being updated to include a "strength of local gravity" parameter :D

"velocity relative to timebase station", too

[14:46:24.0570] <bakkot>
if we're doing velocity we need acceleration and jerk and so on as well, so we can properly represent dates in the future

[14:46:37.0262] <bakkot>
really just a full PDE I figure

[14:52:33.0535] <Andreu Botella>
the curvature of the entire universe too

The current time systems in common use are only really designed to work on the surface of the Earth. Astronomers and other space scientists use different time systems which account for relativistic effects such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_Dynamical_Time

[17:21:00.0409] <waldemar>
One of my favorite papers is measuring the masses of various solar system bodies such as Saturn using nothing more than clocks, comparing earthbound clocks to clocks outside the solar system (in the form of distant pulsars): https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3607

[17:24:04.0707] <waldemar>
The approach of counting seconds won't work well after we expand into space because clocks tick at different rates in different places in the solar system. If you want everyone to stay synced to Earth time, you'll need to adjust the duration of the second depending on where you are. If you want to keep the SI definition of a second, clocks in various places will diverge over time.

[17:25:16.0778] <waldemar>
We already have that issue with spacecraft, but the scientists and engineers working them account for the differences.

requesting consensus for an eclipse break on Monday

[15:39:42.0077] <Chris de Almeida>
well. I guess that doesn't make much sense unless the break is like.. 2 hours long

[15:39:44.0800] <Aki>
i wonder if people will be too distributed

[15:39:46.0787] <Aki>
lol

[15:39:50.0436] <Aki>
also that

[15:40:40.0576] <Chris de Almeida>
ah, actually for me the meeting will be over already

yeah the farther east you are, i think

is there a way to join the meeting without logging in

[07:02:59.0511] <Jesse>
I joined the call anonymously (no prior log in)

[07:03:46.0202] <bakkot>
you do not have to use the client

[07:04:12.0479] <shu>
oh i see, i can just enter any name/email, thanks

[07:04:12.0879] <bakkot>
if you click the "use on the web" it kind of implies you're signing in, but you just put your name and email and then join regardless of what you put in those boxes

[07:04:22.0400] <Chris de Almeida>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> is there a way to join the meeting without logging in

yes

[07:04:37.0660] <littledan>
I just gave my name and email address, and then the "join as guest" button un-grayed

[07:04:52.0415] <littledan>
(done on the native client)

Slides for this presentation at https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/littledan-patch-2/2024/tc39-2024-016.pdf (PR'd to the agenda also)

[07:21:29.0352] <Michael Ficarra>
ooohh we're bringing WinterCG into Ecma?

[07:21:35.0040] <littledan>
yep!

[07:21:40.0316] <ryzokuken>
WinterTC

[07:21:42.0628] <Michael Ficarra>
I imagine it won't continue to be called WinterCG?

[07:22:02.0902] <littledan>
More context: https://github.com/wintercg/admin/issues/58

[07:22:28.0541] <littledan>
The W3C CG will be the main place for technical development; WinterTC will be more for validation and formal standardization (this mirrors CycloneDX)

[07:25:15.0098] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Are temp checks an official vote?

[07:25:21.0423] <littledan>
no

[07:25:26.0632] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It's weird that voting rules apply to temp checks 

[07:26:05.0675] <littledan>
yes, I agree. I think these Ecma rules only apply directly to official votes, which we do not have. That said, I'm not sure if IEs should be able to block.

[07:26:09.0848] <ljharb>
they're def not votes

[07:26:35.0227] <littledan>
calling for consensus on advancement might be thought of as an implicit vote

[07:26:39.0873] <littledan>
but temperature checks certainly aren't fotes

[07:26:43.0137] <littledan>
 * but temperature checks certainly aren't votes

[07:26:44.0160] <Michael Ficarra>
IEs definitely should not be voting/blocking

[07:26:48.0579] <ljharb>
IEs not being able to participate in consensus would be a radical change from the way tc39 has always operated, so that'd be something that needs discussion

[07:27:02.0636] <shu>
IEs should not be able to veto

[07:27:08.0299] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> IEs not being able to participate in consensus would be a radical change from the way tc39 has always operated, so that'd be something that needs discussion

OK, let's have this discussion now with Samina

[07:27:13.0942] <littledan>
in the queue

[07:27:55.0522] <ljharb>
about temp checks sure. but ecma rules aren't really relevant; IEs participate in consensus here, and we'd need an agenda item to get consensus on changing that.

[07:31:40.0124] <ljharb>
shu: "being an IE" is at the discretion of chairs and ecma, so if that were ever abused it would be pretty easy to shut it down

[07:32:48.0877] <eemeli>
Does consensus for stage advancement count as a "vote" in ECMA terms?

[07:33:08.0900] <shu>
imo yes?

[07:33:25.0901] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I think so

[07:33:26.0192] <ljharb>
no

[07:33:27.0989] <shu>
like i don't see why there would be any bylaws if any TC can also just say "actually we don't do that"?

[07:33:33.0498] <ljharb>
it's consensus. not a ote.

[07:33:34.0769] <ljharb>
 * it's consensus. not a vote.

[07:33:43.0685] <ljharb>
if it was a vote than we wouldn't ask individuals, we'd ask members.

[07:33:50.0747] <nicolo-ribaudo>
And we informally agree that the chairs only ask for the vote if there is would be full consensus

[07:34:00.0218] <shu>
i strongly disagree

[07:34:04.0350] <ljharb>
for example, google having 30 delegates would still only get 1 response to a call for consensus. that's not how we operate.

[07:34:19.0368] <littledan>
there has long been disagreement within the committee about what the policy is. It's good for this to be on the table for discussion.

[07:35:06.0618] <ljharb>
 * for example, google having 30 delegates would still only get 1 response to a call for consensus. that's not how we operate, or have literally ever operated.

[07:35:28.0730] <nicolo-ribaudo>
 * And we informally agree that the champions only ask for the vote if there is would be full consensus

[07:35:39.0534] <nicolo-ribaudo>
 * And we informally agree that the champions only "ask for the vote" if there is would be full consensus anyway, so no vote needed

[07:35:45.0497] <ljharb>
it's fine to discuss it, and if someone would like to, it'd be great to add an agenda item for it. but making a change here would be dramatic and unprecedented for tc39, and isn't a matter of simply "interpreting bylaws".

[07:35:47.0564] <eemeli>
It would be Really Good for execom to explicitly comment on our consensus practices.

[07:36:13.0061] <littledan>
good reminder from @ljharb on GitHub teams, and thank you for your good work on setting up the GitHub teams. I do want to note that we have some inconsistencies between the GitHub and Ecma data (which member organizations have provided to Ecma and are published in the Ecma memento) and we will need to work through these. I believe neither one of these is perfectly up to date, and we will make a lot of progress by reconciling them.

[07:36:30.0673] <ljharb>
in general, laws serve the people, so if the bylaws conflict with what we actually do, the bylaws, not us, should change.

[07:37:22.0954] <littledan>
> <@eemeli:mozilla.org> It would be Really Good for execom to explicitly comment on our consensus practices.

In general, the ExeCom and Ecma management are very happy with TC39's "self-governance" and don't want to intervene too much. Ecma folks have previously said that they are happy with consensus-based processes like ours, but have found our way of dealing with vetos as absolute to be a bit much.

[07:37:29.0948] <ljharb>
 * in general, laws serve the people, so if the bylaws conflict with what committees actually do, the bylaws, not us, should change.

[07:39:42.0536] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> in general, laws serve the people, so if the bylaws conflict with what committees actually do, the bylaws, not us, should change.

Yes, I very strongly agree with you that we should be thoughtful about any change to TC39's practices and not just blindly apply rules/bylaws, but consider whether they need to be changed if they don't fit, and submit such changes to the Ecma GA for a vote [in practice, consensus there too]. That said, the committee has long contained multiple opinions about whether IEs can block, so it's not clear what the change would/should be. Ecma rules are still set by the GA and not by TC39 precedent.

[07:40:06.0634] <littledan>
I mean, this is why I got involved in Ecma stuff in the first place, to ensure that we had an IE policy in the first place and that we didn't accidentally kick Babel etc out
