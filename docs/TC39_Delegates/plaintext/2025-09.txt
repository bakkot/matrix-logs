[06:22:36.0742] <Chengzhong Wu>
With https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-bytes, it can be done like `import ... with { type: 'bytes' }` + `textDecoder.decode(buffer)`

[06:27:26.0271] <nicolo-ribaudo>
There was some appetite for it in the last meeting, strongly pushed for by eemeli

[10:16:14.0066] <bakkot>
yeah I think if someone champions it people are in favor

[11:15:21.0081] <eemeli>
I don't think I've the bandwidth for putting together an import-text proposal for the next plenary, but in case no-one else does, I can try to do so for Tokyo.

[13:07:15.0493] <Michael Ficarra>
@leaverou:matrix.org you can see the notes from the related discussion here: https://github.com/tc39/notes/pull/379/files#diff-16e44c4f2f7e8f811605c9425be9e53906830267d08666efe463e866801d96f7R355-R501

[13:50:21.0141] <eemeli>
Here's a slightly easier and more targeted link for the above: https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/bcdb104c5783f2d2eca39b31a1d9ab42a3aa3df0/meetings/2025-07/july-30.md#import-buffer-for-stage-1

Back in 2021, when `Object.hasOwn()` raced all the way to Stage 4 in four months, was something like `Object.getOwn()` considered at all? I can't find any reference to such in the notes or the proposal repo.

I'm currently needing to write this repeatedly in a project, and it feels a bit repetitive:
```
let x = Object.hasOwn(obj, name) ? obj[name] : undefined;
```

[02:55:52.0752] <Lea Verou>
When is the Tokyo plenary? There's TPAC in Japan this year so if they're close I may be able to join too!

[03:00:17.0278] <eemeli>
It's the week after TPAC. The meeting schedule is available here: https://github.com/tc39/agendas

https://github.com/tc39/agendas it seems like the Sept agenda page is not created yet..

[10:02:38.0156] <ljharb>
sorry about that, i'll make it today

[15:41:34.0595] <Rob Palmer>
I created the agenda earlier today and was going to highlight here, but alas Matrix had an outage so could not.

[15:42:02.0326] <Rob Palmer>
Anyway, the agenda is naturally fresh and light, so please add content!

[12:40:37.0569] <bakkot>
so I don't think it's anyone's specific job to merge the notes PRs to https://github.com/tc39/notes/pulls that Aki opens

[12:40:42.0910] <bakkot>
but it would be good to get those merged

[12:40:56.0126] <bakkot>
can we just auto-merge those after a couple of weeks?

[12:40:57.0581] <Aki>
Chairs

[12:41:09.0286] <bakkot>
ok cc chairs

So uh, is there a policy of cancelling a plenary if the agenda is empty? (Or empty by some point?) 

[08:59:47.0254] <bakkot>
People always put stuff on last minute so I don't think it has (or is likely to) come up

[09:00:12.0758] <bakkot>
But for remote plenary we definitely skip the last day or two if possible

[09:11:27.0204] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm sure there will be more added (I intend to add something myself), but this is by far the lightest agenda we've ever had this close to the deadline.

[09:27:24.0333] <Rob Palmer>
Please don't wait to add things to the schedule.  It's better for everyone to see what's coming earlier - even if your materials are not ready yet.

[09:59:54.0278] <eemeli>
Going forward, I think we could drop one of the online plenaries from our annual cycle, and have 3 in-person/hybrid + 2 online.

[10:11:42.0332] <Chris de Almeida>
please add your input to the plenary survey if you have not already done so:

https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/560

[10:11:43.0886] <dminor>
There's an opportunity cost associated with reserving four days for something that ends up only taking one or two. This time around, there was a conference I would have liked to attend, but couldn't, because it would have overlapped with the Wednesday and Thursday plenary days.

[10:15:52.0922] <Chris de Almeida>
is said conference something that could be a conflict for other delegates?  want to make sure it's on the constraints survey if so. (https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/559)

[10:17:40.0756] <dminor>
I don't think so, so I haven't included it in the constraints in the past or for the coming year. It's https://nerdear.la/, I'd be happily surprised if someone else was interested :)

Everyone is equally welcome to update their own answers if opinions have changed over time.

(Perhaps also write a note to say why in this case.)

Knuth and Tanenbaum as speakers! 

[13:56:24.0121] <bakkot>
Does anyone have further comments on https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/pull/164? Can we land it? Who needs to press the button?

[14:09:43.0861] <Chris de Almeida>
there appear to be unresolved comments

[15:07:01.0126] <bakkot>
Chris de Almeida: Responded to the two editorial ones; the other two are basically disagreeing with the policy which we got consensus on.

[15:07:15.0502] <bakkot>
I personally think it's good to go now and people can add further refinements in follow-ups.

Are PR previews broken ? Looks like the upload job has been broken for a few months
