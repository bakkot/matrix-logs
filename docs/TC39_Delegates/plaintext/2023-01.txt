i agree that stuff needs to be figured out, but it's not a blocker - it wasn't a blocker for ecmarkup either.

is there any recent news on the "rm subclassing" proposal?

arguably set methods to Stage 3 is a pretty strong milestone to establishing how these things should work in the future

beyond that, I haven't heard of any progress in the assessments to how web-compatible it'd be to remove some of the ES6 cruft

I seem to remember that someone said last time that Set methods wasn't intended to be a precedent?
