i agree that stuff needs to be figured out, but it's not a blocker - it wasn't a blocker for ecmarkup either.

is there any recent news on the "rm subclassing" proposal?

[11:47:26.0557] <littledan>
arguably set methods to Stage 3 is a pretty strong milestone to establishing how these things should work in the future

[11:47:56.0798] <littledan>
beyond that, I haven't heard of any progress in the assessments to how web-compatible it'd be to remove some of the ES6 cruft

[11:51:57.0772] <ptomato>
I seem to remember that someone said last time that Set methods wasn't intended to be a precedent?

[12:24:23.0316] <shu>
firefox said there were incompats and i have vague memory of waiting on the data there for next steps, but it's been a bit

[12:34:34.0195] <bakkot>
Set methods were explicitly intended to be a precedent https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HCqPMsWiTtsn92gA3b1luVpnVHWVVR0iKaAE0marxkA/edit#slide=id.g13a69787e9f_0_13

[12:36:05.0708] <bakkot>
I do think we should have gone with Symbols rather than strings, and might fight about that when that particular question comes up, but IIRC that was the only point of contention

[12:36:14.0581] <bakkot>
we were all on board with the subclassing behavior, I believe

https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/6f7e075341e435f22777b07a3ee5141442d2d8a7/meetings/2022-03/mar-31.md#extending-built-ins is a better link I guess, since that's the presentation where we talked about subclassing in particular rather than Symbol vs string

[12:41:29.0269] <bakkot>
well, though that was less focused on Symbol.species, actually

[12:41:32.0689] <bakkot>
there's a lot of parts of this...

Ashley Claymore: what's the status of change-array-by-copy? if it's shipping in two places do you want to go for stage 4 in January?

[15:11:18.0315] <bakkot>
I ask because we're going to cut the next edition sometime in the next few months

[15:14:27.0483] <bakkot>
littledan: same question as ^ re: symbols as weakmap keys (not sure if you're the right champion but you're listed first)

Thanks for the ping, we will discuss both of these proposals within Bloomberg and get back to you (possibly via an agenda PR)

[09:32:00.0344] <TabAtkins>
Where's the proposed schedule of the year's meetings posted again? I kinda expected it on the agendas repo, but I only see the upcoming Jan meeting there.

[09:33:12.0172] <Chris de Almeida>
will message you

[09:45:25.0743] <bakkot>
TabAtkins: bottom of https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/main/2023/01.md#dates-and-locations-of-future-meetings

danke, y'all, suggesting we copy it to a more obvious place https://github.com/tc39/agendas/pull/1295

[15:13:21.0400] <ljharb>
can anyone help me come up with values that would trigger the returns on steps 6 and 8 in https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-makeday ?

[15:24:04.0148] <ptomato>
step 6 would return for `Date.UTC(Number.MAX_VALUE, Number.MAX_VALUE)`
