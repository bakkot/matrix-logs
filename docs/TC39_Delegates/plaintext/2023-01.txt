i agree that stuff needs to be figured out, but it's not a blocker - it wasn't a blocker for ecmarkup either.

is there any recent news on the "rm subclassing" proposal?

[11:47:26.0557] <littledan>
arguably set methods to Stage 3 is a pretty strong milestone to establishing how these things should work in the future

[11:47:56.0798] <littledan>
beyond that, I haven't heard of any progress in the assessments to how web-compatible it'd be to remove some of the ES6 cruft

[11:51:57.0772] <ptomato>
I seem to remember that someone said last time that Set methods wasn't intended to be a precedent?

firefox said there were incompats and i have vague memory of waiting on the data there for next steps, but it's been a bit

Set methods were explicitly intended to be a precedent https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HCqPMsWiTtsn92gA3b1luVpnVHWVVR0iKaAE0marxkA/edit#slide=id.g13a69787e9f_0_13

I do think we should have gone with Symbols rather than strings, and might fight about that when that particular question comes up, but IIRC that was the only point of contention

[12:36:14.0581] <bakkot>
we were all on board with the subclassing behavior, I believe
