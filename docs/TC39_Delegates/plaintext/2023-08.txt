bakkot: bad news for your coercion proposal, some people like it https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1686014875040956416

ljharb: some people are incorrect

this is someone who teaches beginner javascript, according to the twitter profile

He's one of the most popular and influential people in JS dev content targeted at beginners to early intermediate 

[07:59:30.0359] <shu>
alas

[07:59:43.0955] <shu>
teaching `at(0.1)` as a benefit seems not good to me

[08:01:01.0336] <Anthony Bullard>
Not going to argue that.  And does somewhat surprise me

[08:01:28.0522] <Anthony Bullard>
I haven't been in discussions on .at() so I was unaware of the coercion

[08:02:18.0307] <shu>
there were no discussions around coercion specifically at the time, the method follows the coercion precedence of other methods

[08:02:31.0771] <Anthony Bullard>
I wasn't aware it worked with other array methods either, hadn't tried in that in my 24 years of JavaScripting

[08:02:46.0986] <shu>
which is the point of bakkot's proposal. we've been operating on precedence grounds for decades, it's time to rethink that

[08:02:48.0945] <Anthony Bullard>
Never even occurred to me to try

[08:02:53.0235] <shu>
yeah

[08:04:16.0715] <rkirsling>
huh

[08:04:41.0503] <rkirsling>
yeah I can't say I've ever attempted to pass a non-integral number to `slice`, say

[08:11:06.0271] <Anthony Bullard>
Strangely enough it works. Had to open a terminal to prove it to myself

[08:12:22.0999] <rkirsling>
yeah.

[08:13:58.0025] <rkirsling>
the thing is that if `array[1.2]` were already valid, then you could argue that `array.at(1.2)` is a non-regression, or something

[08:14:57.0605] <rkirsling>
but given that `array[1.2]` is not in fact equivalent to `array[1]`, it definitely seems hard to consider the equivalence of `.at(1.2)` and `.at(1)` a good thing

[08:15:03.0076] <rkirsling>
I don't necessarily mean that we screwed up

[08:15:11.0947] <rkirsling>
but for educational materials...

[08:15:18.0762] <rkirsling>

 * the thing is that if `array[1.2]` already worked like that, then you could argue that `array.at(1.2)` is a non-regression, or something
