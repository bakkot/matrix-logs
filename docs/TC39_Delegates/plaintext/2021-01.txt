Hello

[02:44:37.0758] <ryzokuken>
ðŸ‘‹

[03:22:48.0155] <littledan>
I guess this room would be a place that we would test out the permissions capabilities to ensure we can limit it to just delegates

[05:22:14.0764] <smorimoto>
my pleasure meeting you all here

[05:27:44.0414] <ryzokuken>

[13:47:31.0521] <bterlson>
Are permissions set up on this channel at all?

[13:47:51.0605] <devsnek>
anyone can join afaik

[13:48:41.0404] <bterlson>
no +m equivalent though?

[13:49:17.0883] <mpcsh>
not yet bterlson - I'll make you an admin so you can play around

[13:49:34.0431] <ryzokuken>
there is only moderator and admin. 

[13:49:45.0962] <ryzokuken>
I suppose moderator could be a +m stand-in

[13:50:34.0581] <bterlson>
I see something about "custom level"

[13:50:36.0943] <mpcsh>
there is a "custom level" which seems to just be an int

[13:50:39.0389] <mpcsh>
jinx

[13:50:54.0869] <bterlson>
dang I'll buy you a coke later

[13:51:01.0256] <ryzokuken>
lol we can give folks a custom level to signify delegates maybe?

[13:51:28.0628] <devsnek>
admin+1

[13:52:03.0567] <bterlson>
I don't understand

[13:52:12.0248] <bterlson>
level is a signed int

[13:52:59.0823] <bterlson>
I changed it but I don't know how to change it back :(

[13:53:03.0276] <bterlson>
I think I broke it already

[13:53:23.0448] <ryzokuken>
lol it's fixed

[13:53:46.0839] <bterlson>
ok I guess 0 is default then?

[13:54:14.0119] <bterlson>
ok I'm going to read a giant blog post on power levels now I guess

[13:54:30.0918] <ryzokuken>
lol I think mod is 50 and admin is 100

[13:54:39.0728] <ryzokuken>
you can make a custom 10 or sth for delegates

[13:57:28.0677] <bterlson>
ok interesting

[13:57:33.0552] <bterlson>
I like this system much

[13:58:01.0685] <ryzokuken>
okay

[13:58:04.0489] <ryzokuken>
I can post

[13:58:07.0724] <ryzokuken>
can others?

[13:58:19.0324] <bterlson>
oh I haven't changed the perms required to talk yet

[13:58:20.0903] <bterlson>
let's try that

[13:59:38.0076] <bterlson>
ok @Ry

[13:59:45.0928] <bterlson>
ok ryzokuken try talking

[13:59:54.0938] <bterlson>
devsnek: try too?

[14:00:00.0933] <ryzokuken>
I can talk

[14:00:07.0974] <bterlson>
@dev

[14:00:14.0584] <ryzokuken>
devsnek: 

[14:00:23.0606] <bterlson>
cannot I assume, since he has read and has not replied lol

[14:00:27.0546] <bterlson>
neat

[14:00:42.0189] <ryzokuken>
lol

[14:00:53.0979] <devsnek>
hello!

[14:00:58.0148] <ryzokuken>
fair point

[14:02:31.0695] <ryzokuken>
oh wow

[14:02:38.0292] <bterlson>
this is really annoying to do though

[14:04:24.0577] <devsnek>
its just like setting +m

[14:04:29.0197] <bterlson>
oh I can use command line too

[14:04:30.0778] <devsnek>
or +v or whatever

[14:04:37.0565] <bterlson>
yeah I was poking at the UI

[14:04:49.0001] <bterlson>
I am unsure who smorimoto and s-urabe are, can anyone confirm delegate status?

[14:05:36.0091] <ryzokuken>
I believe they are chinese delegates?

[14:05:39.0006] <ryzokuken>
but we can ask ðŸ˜€ 

[14:05:56.0383] <bterlson>
well now they can't reply lol

[14:05:59.0361] <ryzokuken>
smorimoto: s-urabe  can you confirm that you are delegates? Thank you ðŸ˜€ 

[14:06:06.0789] <ryzokuken>
oop

[14:06:12.0253] <bterlson>
what should the process be there?

[14:06:20.0002] <bterlson>
on irc it was grovel to me or aki, I don't like that process

[14:06:29.0874] <bterlson>
I think any delegate can make anyone else a delegate

[14:06:40.0769] <bterlson>
which is an improvement

[14:06:50.0518] <bterlson>
but how to message that you need access?

[14:06:55.0803] <mpcsh>
bterlson: we can set the default permission level of people who join the room to be 10, and then demote non-delegates who join?

[14:07:13.0021] <mpcsh>
we can also set the room to be invite-only but world-readable and tightly control the invite link

[14:07:23.0130] <bterlson>
the list of non-delegates seems like a larger set than the list of delegates

[14:07:42.0804] <bterlson>
I imagine the permission list will cap out at some max length?

[14:07:50.0317] <ryzokuken>
well, if we used matrix by default, they would submit their usernames by github

[14:08:17.0448] <bterlson>
yeah we can rely on the onboarding process once everyone is onboarded I suppose

[14:09:50.0998] <bterlson>
what about an "ask in #tc39-general" process?

[14:09:55.0316] <bterlson>
 * what about an "ask in #tc39-general" process?

[14:10:50.0598] <devsnek>
rendezvous with brian at meeting point charlie to confirm your identity

[14:11:23.0668] <mpcsh>
encode your access request with IP-over-Avian-carrier and send it to Brian's house

[14:11:41.0316] <bterlson>
lol

[14:12:13.0515] <bterlson>
The tree birds liked to hang out on blew onto my house last week so avian service may be disrupted somewhat

[14:12:26.0075] <bterlson>
meeting point charlie more reliable

[14:13:42.0487] <bterlson>
how good is the video conferencing?

[14:15:41.0587] <mpcsh>
> <@bterlson:matrix.org> how good is the video conferencing?

you mean the jitsi widget?

[14:16:01.0217] <bterlson>
I dunno, I have a video button in the element.io client, I'm afraid to hit it

[14:16:52.0912] <mpcsh>
oh huh look at that

[14:17:00.0268] <mpcsh>
try it in #tc39-matrix-pilot-feedback:matrix.org ?

[14:36:38.0927] <bterlson>
how is the jitsi client privileged in this way?

[14:54:57.0507] <mpcsh>
matrix.org has a set of widgets that are available to any room on the homeserver

[15:36:58.0393] <devsnek>
bterlson: matrix includes webrtc signaling, so you can hook up stuff like jitsi to it
