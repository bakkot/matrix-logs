what does a signals proposal mean? reading the angular docs about "signals" they don't appear to be anything special enough to need runtime integration

i indeed was being salty from abortcontroller and observables and predicting a bad outcome for signals, and i know dan's got good motives here so hopefully it'll work out

but pretty much every time someone's prioritized faster shipping over a better result it's ended up being a major wart, and it's frustrating that we collectively never seem to learn from those mistakes

I love how the style is so distinct that a simple drawing of an umbrella can be so obviously Seussian
