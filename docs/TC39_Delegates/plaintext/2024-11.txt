nicolo-ribaudo: is there a repo yet for `Avoid capturing lexical context in indirect eval` ?

[11:58:18.0151] <Justin Ridgewell>
> <@gibson042:matrix.org> here's a rather stark example:

> const frozen = Object.freeze([...unfrozen]);
> fn = arr => arr.slice().concat("FIN");
> let result;

> result = fn(frozen); // 1.427 ops/ms

Pardon my ignorance on this, are there any current proposals on class mixins? This came up in a web components issue

 * Pardon my ignorance on this, are there any current proposals on class mixins? This came up in a web components issue (around custom attributes)

I thought there were only stage 0 ones, nothing on a later stage afaik

@leaverou:matrix.org share a link if you do

[08:12:48.0336] <Lea Verou>
Will do, though I suspect it will be a while before I get to it. There's a backlog of blog posts I want to write :P

coconut vibes, surely

[09:13:25.0708] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> I'm curious how you judge this

things that I see people talking about, that get a lot of attention on social media and from blog posts

[09:14:02.0073] <Michael Ficarra>
I've been working a lot on iterator-related proposals because, aside from me personally finding them useful, they are both viable and always get a lot of positive reactions from the community

[09:14:14.0252] <Michael Ficarra>
not too many things in that overlap

[09:33:28.0366] <ljharb>
i think protocols is something lots of people would be excited about, but it's had no movement in like 6 years

[09:33:54.0832] <ljharb>
people are pretty excited about signals and protocols feel even more broadly applicable than signals

[09:40:38.0845] <Anthony Bullard>
Signals have a lot of energy around them because of the positive impact they are having on nearly all front end frameworks (sans React).  I dont know how many individual application-level problems protocols would solve in the eyes of the bulk of developers.

This is why I discussed the importance of interfacing with the community during the proposal process, doing so will probably increase the quality of the proposal and uncover questions that may not have been asked - and earlier.

[10:16:10.0507] <Chris de Almeida>
well, good thing it's not a zero-sum game

[10:16:45.0160] <Chris de Almeida>
I would submit that it is easy to see the utility of object composition

[10:20:15.0362] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> well, good thing it's not a zero-sum game

browser are getting stingy, especially about things that come with syntax (which the protocols proposal has but does not require), so it kinda is

[10:21:03.0683] <Chris de Almeida>
even if true, we should not presume we are dead in the water

[10:21:40.0459] <Michael Ficarra>
oh I definitely don't think it's dead, I just want to have some momentum behind it before I sink my time into it

[10:21:54.0056] <Chris de Almeida>
sure, I get it

[10:22:05.0618] <Michael Ficarra>
it's a bit of a catch-22, I know

[10:22:15.0583] <Chris de Almeida>
my comment was about signals vs protocols being a false dichotomy 

[10:23:02.0926] <shu>
what is the game

[10:23:18.0587] <shu>
if it's people's time, that _is_ a zero-sum game

[10:25:29.0978] <Chris de Almeida>
to be clear -- it's not as if we are being forced to choose either signals or protocols, and then that's the end of the other proposal.  I regret that the comparison was made, because this is a distraction

[10:26:29.0158] <shu>
anyway Anthony Bullard's point is a good one

[10:26:39.0065] <shu>
argue from tangible benefits and impacts

[10:28:29.0876] <Anthony Bullard>
Chris de Almeida: to be clear, I was just giving my perspective on why the disparity in excitement for the two proposals

Let's have a conversation about all of the outstanding syntax things under discussion, so we can look at it together and prioritize, if we have this limited budget

[09:39:30.0634] <littledan>
(also I'm not sure whether the "limited budget" thing is for syntax specifically, or whether syntax is distinguished by something which has a potential solution in build tools and other sources of complexity are more difficult to solve for. But still, we should think about syntax all together IMO)

Delegates!  Please fill in the June 2025 Plenary Scheduling Survey üöÄüöÄ

- [**Survey Link**](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/543)

There are different date possibilities.  We need to know your intentions in order to pick the best time.  Thanks to the 10 people who have already given replies üôè



[11:05:50.0972] <sffc>
On the June Plenary survey, many delegates are posting comments such as "prefer week 22 over 24" and "family vacation on week 22".

Some question:

1. Are you using this language more because this specific situation warrants it (we are comparing and contrasting two choices of weeks), or more because you generally refer to dates in this way?
2. How did you compute the week numbers?
3. Do you ever use language such as "Wednesday, Week 22 or 2025" as a drop-in replacement for "May 28, 2025"?

I am asking this because I am working on a proposal related to week calendars in CLDR, which may influence Intl and MessageFormat. I rarely encounter week numbering in en-US, instead saying things like "first full week of June", so I am asking this as a research question.

[11:08:30.0211] <shu>
i don't think i hear "week N" to refer to absolute dates in a year in american english

[11:09:10.0650] <shu>
i think i only hear it in "weeks elapsed from some other event" contexts, like "week 5 of the lockdown"

[11:10:03.0373] <shu>
(i mean first of all, who would know when week 22 is? are there cultures that just know this in the way we know when May is?"

We use it a lot internally at Igalia, and I guess it happened in that survey that Ujjwal wrote it and others started copying

[11:16:59.0153] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I don't know how we define week 1, but it matches Google Calendar's definition

It is very common in German - Kalenderwoche 22, or more commonly KW22

[12:04:00.0919] <shu>
i expect nothing less of germans

[12:33:31.0700] <Michael Ficarra>
@sffc:mozilla.org even in en_US, certain industries use calendar week pretty commonly

[12:33:38.0146] <Michael Ficarra>
like timeshares

[12:34:02.0955] <Michael Ficarra>
and I think certain financial industries, but not sure

[12:34:19.0888] <Michael Ficarra>
* @sffc:mozilla.org even in en_US, certain industries use calendar week

[12:39:19.0679] <Marja H√∂ltt√§ (not here, use marja@google.com)>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date under section "first week" seems to tell how week numbers are determined. (and yea it's very common to use week numbers in various european countries.) to answer the other above questions 1) it's used when referring to whole weeks, like, if you're on vacation the whole week you might say you're on vacation on week 14. 3) no. only when you already brought the week number into the context, you might say "i'm on vacation on week 14 and on wednesday [that week] i'll go swimming", but you'd never say "week 14 wednesday" or something like that.

[14:21:34.0785] <sffc>
OK so one of my main research questions (and I realize that this is not a representative sample) is whether anyone uses something _other than_ the ISO numbering in practice. Most people I know who use week numbers are European, and presumably use the ISO numbers, but Wikipedia and CLDR both document other numbering schemes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week#Other_week_numbering_systems

[14:23:15.0785] <sffc>
Apparently in en-US I'm supposed to count weeks based on the first week that contains a Saturday as opposed to the first week that contains a Thursday as in ISO, but I rarely count weeks, so I don't really care which system I use, and since most people I know who count weeks do it in ISO, I most often also use ISO. But again, anecdotal evidence.

[15:07:48.0677] <TabAtkins>
(American) While I don't count weeks either, when I've interacted with week-counting (talking with Europeans), it's always been ISO.
