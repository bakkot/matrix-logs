[09:13:25.0708] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> I'm curious how you judge this

things that I see people talking about, that get a lot of attention on social media and from blog posts

[09:14:02.0073] <Michael Ficarra>
I've been working a lot on iterator-related proposals because, aside from me personally finding them useful, they are both viable and always get a lot of positive reactions from the community

[09:14:14.0252] <Michael Ficarra>
not too many things in that overlap

[09:33:28.0366] <ljharb>
i think protocols is something lots of people would be excited about, but it's had no movement in like 6 years

[09:33:54.0832] <ljharb>
people are pretty excited about signals and protocols feel even more broadly applicable than signals

[09:40:38.0845] <Anthony Bullard>
Signals have a lot of energy around them because of the positive impact they are having on nearly all front end frameworks (sans React).  I dont know how many individual application-level problems protocols would solve in the eyes of the bulk of developers.

This is why I discussed the importance of interfacing with the community during the proposal process, doing so will probably increase the quality of the proposal and uncover questions that may not have been asked - and earlier.

[10:16:10.0507] <Chris de Almeida>
well, good thing it's not a zero-sum game

[10:16:45.0160] <Chris de Almeida>
I would submit that it is easy to see the utility of object composition

[10:20:15.0362] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> well, good thing it's not a zero-sum game

browser are getting stingy, especially about things that come with syntax (which the protocols proposal has but does not require), so it kinda is

[10:21:03.0683] <Chris de Almeida>
even if true, we should not presume we are dead in the water

[10:21:40.0459] <Michael Ficarra>
oh I definitely don't think it's dead, I just want to have some momentum behind it before I sink my time into it

[10:21:54.0056] <Chris de Almeida>
sure, I get it

[10:22:05.0618] <Michael Ficarra>
it's a bit of a catch-22, I know

[10:22:15.0583] <Chris de Almeida>
my comment was about signals vs protocols being a false dichotomy 

[10:23:02.0926] <shu>
what is the game

[10:23:18.0587] <shu>
if it's people's time, that _is_ a zero-sum game

[10:25:29.0978] <Chris de Almeida>
to be clear -- it's not as if we are being forced to choose either signals or protocols, and then that's the end of the other proposal.  I regret that the comparison was made, because this is a distraction

[10:26:29.0158] <shu>
anyway Anthony Bullard's point is a good one

[10:26:39.0065] <shu>
argue from tangible benefits and impacts

[10:28:29.0876] <Anthony Bullard>
Chris de Almeida: to be clear, I was just giving my perspective on why the disparity in excitement for the two proposals

Let's have a conversation about all of the outstanding syntax things under discussion, so we can look at it together and prioritize, if we have this limited budget

[09:39:30.0634] <littledan>
(also I'm not sure whether the "limited budget" thing is for syntax specifically, or whether syntax is distinguished by something which has a potential solution in build tools and other sources of complexity are more difficult to solve for. But still, we should think about syntax all together IMO)

Delegates!  Please fill in the June 2025 Plenary Scheduling Survey 🚀🚀

- [**Survey Link**](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/543)

There are different date possibilities.  We need to know your intentions in order to pick the best time.  Thanks to the 10 people who have already given replies 🙏



[11:05:50.0972] <sffc>
On the June Plenary survey, many delegates are posting comments such as "prefer week 22 over 24" and "family vacation on week 22".

Some question:

1. Are you using this language more because this specific situation warrants it (we are comparing and contrasting two choices of weeks), or more because you generally refer to dates in this way?
2. How did you compute the week numbers?
3. Do you ever use language such as "Wednesday, Week 22 or 2025" as a drop-in replacement for "May 28, 2025"?

I am asking this because I am working on a proposal related to week calendars in CLDR, which may influence Intl and MessageFormat. I rarely encounter week numbering in en-US, instead saying things like "first full week of June", so I am asking this as a research question.

[11:08:30.0211] <shu>
i don't think i hear "week N" to refer to absolute dates in a year in american english

[11:09:10.0650] <shu>
i think i only hear it in "weeks elapsed from some other event" contexts, like "week 5 of the lockdown"

[11:10:03.0373] <shu>
(i mean first of all, who would know when week 22 is? are there cultures that just know this in the way we know when May is?"

We use it a lot internally at Igalia, and I guess it happened in that survey that Ujjwal wrote it and others started copying

It is very common in German - Kalenderwoche 22, or more commonly KW22

i expect nothing less of germans

[12:33:31.0700] <Michael Ficarra>
@sffc:mozilla.org even in en_US, certain industries use calendar week pretty commonly

[12:33:38.0146] <Michael Ficarra>
like timeshares

[12:34:02.0955] <Michael Ficarra>
and I think certain financial industries, but not sure

[12:34:19.0888] <Michael Ficarra>
* @sffc:mozilla.org even in en_US, certain industries use calendar week

[12:39:19.0679] <Marja Hölttä (not here, use marja@google.com)>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date under section "first week" seems to tell how week numbers are determined. (and yea it's very common to use week numbers in various european countries.) to answer the other above questions 1) it's used when referring to whole weeks, like, if you're on vacation the whole week you might say you're on vacation on week 14. 3) no. only when you already brought the week number into the context, you might say "i'm on vacation on week 14 and on wednesday [that week] i'll go swimming", but you'd never say "week 14 wednesday" or something like that.

[14:21:34.0785] <sffc>
OK so one of my main research questions (and I realize that this is not a representative sample) is whether anyone uses something _other than_ the ISO numbering in practice. Most people I know who use week numbers are European, and presumably use the ISO numbers, but Wikipedia and CLDR both document other numbering schemes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Week#Other_week_numbering_systems

[14:23:15.0785] <sffc>
Apparently in en-US I'm supposed to count weeks based on the first week that contains a Saturday as opposed to the first week that contains a Thursday as in ISO, but I rarely count weeks, so I don't really care which system I use, and since most people I know who count weeks do it in ISO, I most often also use ISO. But again, anecdotal evidence.

[15:07:48.0677] <TabAtkins>
(American) While I don't count weeks either, when I've interacted with week-counting (talking with Europeans), it's always been ISO.

if it's supposed to be adjacent to the hackathon, why are none of the dates adjacent to the dates of the hackathon?

[09:45:19.0881] <ryzokuken>
it's adjacent to the web engines hackfest (https://webengineshackfest.org/) (website not yet updated for 2025)

[09:45:33.0735] <ryzokuken>
it's not strictly adjacent because of the weekend 

[09:46:52.0794] <ryzokuken>
but option 2 (28th to 30th May) is the closest with just the weekend between the two

[09:47:36.0553] <jakobjingleheimer>

Oh yes they did, it's June 12th

[09:50:04.0480] <ryzokuken>
it's hard if not impossible to avoid conflicts like there's multiple events every week 

[09:50:10.0914] <littledan>

from the process doc.  is this accurate?  can the committee literally choose anyone? or is there an unwritten requirement that they must be on committee

[11:57:20.0606] <jakobjingleheimer>
ljharb: in America. In Europe, they've been out for a couple weeks ;)

But actually doesn't American school get out mid-June?

[13:08:49.0656] <ljharb>
Yes, first or second week usually

Concretely, the proposed change for removing subclasses of (Shared)ArrayBuffer just means that .slice doesn't look at @@species, right?

[09:32:18.0744] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Or does it have other consequences?

[09:34:06.0926] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh well, I was overlooking that the change on TypedArray has much more impact

[09:58:12.0785] <mgaudet>
Mostly yes; I have a prototype patch here https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D225879 which also shows the set of test cases in 262 that would fail with that approach. 

If we think that's too strong, I also have a proposed relaxation which could also preserve Type II subclassing https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D227063

Yeah, it's a research meeting hosted jointly with a local university. The goal is to establish collaboration with research groups working on JavaScript and/or in the field of PL design, evolution, and implementation. The workshops are half-day events. Previous workshops were held in [Finland](https://github.com/tc39/tg5/blob/main/workshops/2024/102.md) and [Japan](https://github.com/tc39/tg5/blob/main/workshops/2024/104.md).

nothing’s changed with the proposal. I’m hoping that the “boil the ocean” requirement won’t still exist

[09:34:16.0713] <mgaudet>
So reading the notes (I can't find old slides here) it doesn't seem like much has meaningfully changed? Like I'm not saying that it's in good shape, but I'm curious about what you plan on presenting

[09:34:33.0555] <mgaudet>
*It being here "the state of Error stacks" 

[09:36:19.0013] <mgaudet>
We have a real webcompat problem around Errors that I have volunteered to try and look into (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1886820) and it's definitely related to this and we may need to do something absolutely funky which ends up aligning things 

[09:37:33.0802] <mgaudet>
This actually bakes -more- of the web platform onto the opposite side of what you've got speced now, which is Error.prototype.stack 

[09:50:20.0984] <ljharb>
nothing has changed, yes. the intention of the proposal is to specify the schema/structure, and not the contents

[09:51:40.0716] <ljharb>
i'd love an issue filed that talks more about the compat issue. i'm not that familiar with captureStackTrace since the plan was always to get it removed entirely

[09:59:05.0215] <mgaudet>
Unfortunately that ship may have sailed when WebKit shipped it https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/commit/997e074bb35ed07b69c9b821141c91dd548e0d02

it'd be great to standardize this web reality around stacks, e.g., in Annex B, but if TC39 doesn't want to do it, we could do it in WHATWG.

A gentle reminder that proposals up for advancement to Stage 2, 2.7, 3 or 4 must have their supporting materials added prior to the advancement deadline, or delegates can withhold consensus solely on the basis of missing the deadline.

[11:24:25.0212] <ljharb>
in my case there are no supporting materials :-)

[12:06:21.0051] <littledan>
I'd encourage everyone to put all agenda items and supporting materials out there before the advancement deadline, just to help folks prepare, even if not advancing.

[15:24:43.0952] <shu>
ljharb: there were many blocking concerns last time stacks were discussed, including conflicting ones. without supporting materials, i don't know what you're actually proposing for stage advancement that addressed those concerns

[15:28:53.0831] <ljharb>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> ljharb: there were many blocking concerns last time stacks were discussed, including conflicting ones. without supporting materials, i don't know what you're actually proposing for stage advancement that addressed those concerns

that isn't my recollection; from what I recall the only blocking concern for stage 2 specifically (as opposed to later stages) was the requirement to specify the entire contents of the text as opposed to just the structure (as it currently is). i'm proposing to revisit that discussion with no changes to the proposal and, if concerns still exist, get them freshly documented.

[15:31:00.0301] <shu>
i'm going off https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2019-03/mar-28.md#error-stacks-for-stage-2:~:text=JHD%3A%20To%20restate,need%20to%20make.

[15:31:09.0425] <shu>
is there a more recent meeting i missed? i might've missed that one too actually

nope, that's the one. that highlighted summary, though, is the "boil the ocean" work that continues to feel like an unreasonable ask, considering the current proposal is a stepping stone to that one.

Reminder:  Please fill out the [Survey of Interest to Attend the February 2025 TC39 Plenary In-Person](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/546) by Thursday 6 December 2024.

This is in sunny Seattle.  It takes one minute to complete the survey.

is there a reason why squashing is disabled on the agendas repo?

[14:17:34.0374] <nicolo-ribaudo>
If I remember correctly it's something about it breaking the git graph, and ljharb:  prefers to squash locally, push, and merge to do it the right way

... it's an agenda repo

[14:35:51.0850] <ljharb>
yep, that’s why

[14:36:18.0649] <ljharb>
There’s no urgency to merge agenda PRs tho, I’ll get to them all :-)

[14:37:39.0121] <Michael Ficarra>
okay but the consequence of that is that I'm going to press the rebase button instead and land a commit in the history that doesn't pass CI

[14:37:58.0379] <Michael Ficarra>
I would care more if this was a code repo because it would make bisecting painful

[14:38:09.0733] <Michael Ficarra>
but is this really the better of the two options?

[14:45:57.0717] <bakkot>
counterpoint I would prefer agenda PRs be merged asap so that I am more likely to see them when I click on the agenda

if it's adding a topic, that's reasonable. but schedule constraints only matter to chairs, and supporting materials are something you'd be hunting for

[15:33:32.0638] <ljharb>
but also if that was a concern for most people, you wouldn't need a PR either - you can push things directly to the agenda.

[15:34:18.0276] <ljharb>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> okay but the consequence of that is that I'm going to press the rebase button instead and land a commit in the history that doesn't pass CI

CI? it's an agenda repo

 * CI? it's an agenda repo, if it's failing i'll get to that, too

[15:34:32.0210] <Michael Ficarra>
it has CI though lol

[15:34:54.0544] <ljharb>
i mean these are all tradeoffs, we can't all have everything :-)

[15:35:20.0243] <ljharb>
if one wants things merged fast then i'd assume one probably needs to be ok with failing CI, or no CI at all

[15:35:55.0746] <Michael Ficarra>
personally, I would prefer the squashes, regardless of how GitHub mutilates the git history, but since this isn't a code repo, I'm not gonna die on that hill

[15:42:59.0368] <bakkot>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> if it's adding a topic, that's reasonable. but schedule constraints only matter to chairs, and supporting materials are something you'd be hunting for

I don't want to hunt for them

[15:43:03.0141] <bakkot>
I want to just see them on the agenda

[15:43:34.0429] <ljharb>
so you want to rely on someone else noticing the PRs and merging them, since you won't see the PRs? because if you're seeing the PRs then you already know they're there.

[15:43:55.0461] <bakkot>
well, or for people to click the button themselves once it passes CI, yeah

[15:43:57.0131] <bakkot>
I do that sometimes

[15:44:42.0915] <bakkot>
I will send a PR so people watching the agenda repo are notified and then merge it so people checking the agenda manually are notified
