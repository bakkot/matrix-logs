if a proxy returns configurable: false for property "x", why future calls return true throws an error? (I know it is maintaining invariant) it can also silently change configurable to false IMO

Why would it be better to silently fail to recognize a bug?

arguably it could have just not called the trap once the value wouldn’t change, but here we are

My understanding is that Proxies don't have a memory. The invariants that involve time are enforced by comparing the result to the same call made to the target object. So the invariants would be broken if the target object has broken the invariant, but hosts are not supposed to create objects that break the invariants
