Happy 2026. 🎉
Clarification request: Is the 112 meeting scheduled from 2026‑01-20 to 23 or 2026‑01-20 to 22; 3 or 4 days? 


[00:53:51.0208] <saminahusain>
Thanks

[04:23:19.0261] <eemeli>
Pretty sure it's intentionally three days.

[06:02:07.0705] <saminahusain>
Ok, thanks.

[10:39:33.0126] <Michael Ficarra>
given the current status of the agenda... it's likely only 1

[11:58:20.0988] <Chris de Almeida>
The deadline for proposal advancement is in ~5 days and there is lots of room available on the agenda. Please add your topics! 🙏

That was absolutely an AI response. The arguments also don't make sense, syntax is much easier to understand and detect than an imperative method.

Should the following intl proposal repos be archived?
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-unit-format

The first two have reached Stage 4, while the last was effectively superseded by NumberFormat v3.

[08:25:42.0924] <Chris de Almeida>
def the stage 4 ones

[10:01:36.0001] <Michael Ficarra>
the stage 1 one should be formally withdrawn if it's been superseded

[10:05:36.0392] <eemeli>
Is the formal withdrawal something that needs to be proposed by the champion, or any delegate?

[10:27:05.0346] <Michael Ficarra>
🤷‍♂️ dunno, but probably anybody can do it

[12:49:54.0009] <ljharb>
if it’s uncontroversial you can just update the proposals repo, and mention it next plenary, i think

[12:55:46.0016] <eemeli>
Zibi (the proposal's champion) was on today's TG2 call, and I gather that the request to withdraw it will be included in the TG2 update at plenary.

[12:55:55.0635] <Chris de Almeida>
> Is the formal withdrawal something that needs to be proposed by the champion, or any delegate?

mostly depends if the champion(s) are active and/or reachable

but anyone can technically propose it.  it should be formally on the meeting agenda to withdraw it

[12:56:37.0779] <Chris de Almeida>
given that Zibi just made a commit to the repo saying it's deprecated in favor of Unified Intl.NumberFormat, seems safe for anyone to put it on the agenda for the upcoming meeting

[12:57:31.0565] <eemeli>
(I'll miss the next plenary, so not available to submit an agenda item for the withdrawal.)

[12:58:09.0623] <Chris de Almeida>
you can put my name down on it if you don't mind creating the PR

[12:58:38.0694] <eemeli>
Sure, will do.

[13:04:52.0432] <eemeli>
Done. Adding the item increases the total timeboxed time by over 4%, from 70 to 73 minutes.
