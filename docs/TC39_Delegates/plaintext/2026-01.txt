Happy 2026. 🎉
Clarification request: Is the 112 meeting scheduled from 2026‑01-20 to 23 or 2026‑01-20 to 22; 3 or 4 days? 


[00:53:51.0208] <saminahusain>
Thanks

[04:23:19.0261] <eemeli>
Pretty sure it's intentionally three days.

[06:02:07.0705] <saminahusain>
Ok, thanks.

[10:39:33.0126] <Michael Ficarra>
given the current status of the agenda... it's likely only 1

[11:58:20.0988] <Chris de Almeida>
The deadline for proposal advancement is in ~5 days and there is lots of room available on the agenda. Please add your topics! 🙏

That was absolutely an AI response. The arguments also don't make sense, syntax is much easier to understand and detect than an imperative method.

Should the following intl proposal repos be archived?
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-unit-format

The first two have reached Stage 4, while the last was effectively superseded by NumberFormat v3.

[08:25:42.0924] <Chris de Almeida>
def the stage 4 ones

[10:01:36.0001] <Michael Ficarra>
the stage 1 one should be formally withdrawn if it's been superseded

[10:05:36.0392] <eemeli>
Is the formal withdrawal something that needs to be proposed by the champion, or any delegate?

[10:27:05.0346] <Michael Ficarra>
🤷‍♂️ dunno, but probably anybody can do it

[12:49:54.0009] <ljharb>
if it’s uncontroversial you can just update the proposals repo, and mention it next plenary, i think

[12:55:46.0016] <eemeli>
Zibi (the proposal's champion) was on today's TG2 call, and I gather that the request to withdraw it will be included in the TG2 update at plenary.

[12:55:55.0635] <Chris de Almeida>
> Is the formal withdrawal something that needs to be proposed by the champion, or any delegate?

mostly depends if the champion(s) are active and/or reachable

but anyone can technically propose it.  it should be formally on the meeting agenda to withdraw it

[12:56:37.0779] <Chris de Almeida>
given that Zibi just made a commit to the repo saying it's deprecated in favor of Unified Intl.NumberFormat, seems safe for anyone to put it on the agenda for the upcoming meeting

[12:57:31.0565] <eemeli>
(I'll miss the next plenary, so not available to submit an agenda item for the withdrawal.)

[12:58:09.0623] <Chris de Almeida>
you can put my name down on it if you don't mind creating the PR

[12:58:38.0694] <eemeli>
Sure, will do.

[13:04:52.0432] <eemeli>
Done. Adding the item increases the total timeboxed time by over 4%, from 70 to 73 minutes.

The agenda now has a whole day of content!

[18:17:46.0313] <Aki>
so I guess I wasn't the only one who took all of December off

Could somebody archive https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules ?

[10:13:05.0189] <Chris de Almeida>
📢  Due to sparse agenda, next week's plenary meeting is reduced to two days (Tuesday and Wednesday).

[10:13:33.0070] <Chris de Almeida>
draft schedule is now available. link is in the reflector issue:  https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/572

[13:23:54.0955] <Rob Palmer>
For the New York meeting, we don't yet have a community event. Does anyone have contacts with JS meetup groups there?

Please note the Community Event and TG5 workshop have not yet been arranged, so potentially the Monday or Friday should factor into your travel plans.

FYI (Aki ?) ecma-international.org has a cert error (which I figured out after searching ECMA 404 and clicking first link

[08:48:48.0170] <Aki>
how did the cert _suddenly_ expire in April of last year?!

[08:49:40.0128] <Aki>
anyway, thank you mgaudet , I let the secretariat know

[08:50:19.0274] <mgaudet>
Firefox error says "https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/

Unable to communicate securely with peer: requested domain name does not match the server’s certificate." but also that roughly is the end of my TLS knowledge 

[09:53:41.0958] <Rob Palmer>
I'll cast the net wider. Who knows sociable JS people in NY who might have contacts with meetup groups there? 

[13:57:26.0010] <Josh Goldberg 💖>
[Carl Vitullo](https://bsky.app/profile/vcarl.com) -community lead at Reactiflux, generally well-connected- likely is a good lead. I can connect you if you'd like.

Also, looking at the local meetup scene, they've got a couple upcoming ones I bet would love to hear from anybody in TC39:
* [Brooklyn Web Workers](https://bsky.app/profile/brooklynwebworkers.com)
* [NY Web Performance](https://bsky.app/profile/nywebperf.com)

Apologies, I added a late-breaking constraint in https://github.com/tc39/agendas/blob/9f358facee2c51c8d2a17bae4edcb8b4837d70aa/2026/01.md but must have misclicked in the mobile web ui as it committed directly rather than creating a PR.
