Happy 2026. 🎉
Clarification request: Is the 112 meeting scheduled from 2026‑01-20 to 23 or 2026‑01-20 to 22; 3 or 4 days? 


[00:53:51.0208] <saminahusain>
Thanks

[04:23:19.0261] <eemeli>
Pretty sure it's intentionally three days.

[06:02:07.0705] <saminahusain>
Ok, thanks.

[10:39:33.0126] <Michael Ficarra>
given the current status of the agenda... it's likely only 1

[11:58:20.0988] <Chris de Almeida>
The deadline for proposal advancement is in ~5 days and there is lots of room available on the agenda. Please add your topics! 🙏

That was absolutely an AI response. The arguments also don't make sense, syntax is much easier to understand and detect than an imperative method.

Should the following intl proposal repos be archived?
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-unit-format

The first two have reached Stage 4, while the last was effectively superseded by NumberFormat v3.
