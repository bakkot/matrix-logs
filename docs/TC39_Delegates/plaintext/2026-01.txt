[00:53:48.0029] <saminahusain>
Happy 2026. 🎉
Clarification request: Is the 112 meeting scheduled from 2026‑01-20 to 23 or 2026‑01-20 to 22; 3 or 4 days? 


[00:53:51.0208] <saminahusain>
Thanks

[04:23:19.0261] <eemeli>
Pretty sure it's intentionally three days.

[06:02:07.0705] <saminahusain>
Ok, thanks.

[10:39:33.0126] <Michael Ficarra>
given the current status of the agenda... it's likely only 1

[11:58:20.0988] <Chris de Almeida>
The deadline for proposal advancement is in ~5 days and there is lots of room available on the agenda. Please add your topics! 🙏

That was absolutely an AI response. The arguments also don't make sense, syntax is much easier to understand and detect than an imperative method.

Should the following intl proposal repos be archived?
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-unit-format

The first two have reached Stage 4, while the last was effectively superseded by NumberFormat v3.

[08:25:42.0924] <Chris de Almeida>
def the stage 4 ones

[10:01:36.0001] <Michael Ficarra>
the stage 1 one should be formally withdrawn if it's been superseded

[10:05:36.0392] <eemeli>
Is the formal withdrawal something that needs to be proposed by the champion, or any delegate?

[10:27:05.0346] <Michael Ficarra>
🤷‍♂️ dunno, but probably anybody can do it

[12:49:54.0009] <ljharb>
if it’s uncontroversial you can just update the proposals repo, and mention it next plenary, i think

[12:55:46.0016] <eemeli>
Zibi (the proposal's champion) was on today's TG2 call, and I gather that the request to withdraw it will be included in the TG2 update at plenary.

[12:55:55.0635] <Chris de Almeida>
> Is the formal withdrawal something that needs to be proposed by the champion, or any delegate?

mostly depends if the champion(s) are active and/or reachable

but anyone can technically propose it.  it should be formally on the meeting agenda to withdraw it

[12:56:37.0779] <Chris de Almeida>
given that Zibi just made a commit to the repo saying it's deprecated in favor of Unified Intl.NumberFormat, seems safe for anyone to put it on the agenda for the upcoming meeting

[12:57:31.0565] <eemeli>
(I'll miss the next plenary, so not available to submit an agenda item for the withdrawal.)

[12:58:09.0623] <Chris de Almeida>
you can put my name down on it if you don't mind creating the PR

[12:58:38.0694] <eemeli>
Sure, will do.

[13:04:52.0432] <eemeli>
Done. Adding the item increases the total timeboxed time by over 4%, from 70 to 73 minutes.

draft schedule is now available. link is in the reflector issue:  https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/572

[13:23:54.0955] <Rob Palmer>
For the New York meeting, we don't yet have a community event. Does anyone have contacts with JS meetup groups there?

The invite for the March TC39 meeting in New York is now [posted on the reflector.](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/573)

Please note the Community Event and TG5 workshop have not yet been arranged, so potentially the Monday or Friday should factor into your travel plans.

[09:53:41.0958] <Rob Palmer>
I'll cast the net wider. Who knows sociable JS people in NY who might have contacts with meetup groups there? 

[13:57:26.0010] <Josh Goldberg 💖>
[Carl Vitullo](https://bsky.app/profile/vcarl.com) -community lead at Reactiflux, generally well-connected- likely is a good lead. I can connect you if you'd like.

Also, looking at the local meetup scene, they've got a couple upcoming ones I bet would love to hear from anybody in TC39:
* [Brooklyn Web Workers](https://bsky.app/profile/brooklynwebworkers.com)
* [NY Web Performance](https://bsky.app/profile/nywebperf.com)

👋🏻 attendees: volunteering as a note-taker is relatively low effort, please do take a "shift" (as long or as little as you're comfortable). All that is required is to keep an eye on the transcription and make edits/fixes if errors come up.

[07:15:32.0253] <Aki>
also report back to #temporaldeadzone:matrix.org  any funny homophones or otherwise amusing typos

Congratulations bakkot ! (?)

[07:32:04.0437] <bakkot>
thanks, looking forward to having time off for a while

[07:32:28.0712] <bakkot>
honestly kind of expecting to do more not less committee work, but we'll see what happens

[07:43:20.0057] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I changed the notes template to be Conclusion/Summary/Title rather than Title/Conclusion/Summary, since that's most of the times what we need to copy&paste

[07:43:23.0491] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Please don't revert it!

[07:51:03.0062] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm pretty shocked that GraalJS has a Temporal implementation already

[07:51:24.0724] <Michael Ficarra>
while their implementation is generally very *good*, they often lag behind modern features by a year or more

[07:51:58.0806] <Michael Ficarra>
maybe in this case it's more that the browsers have been slow to implement than that Graal has been fast

[07:52:00.0623] <Aki>
people are hungry for temporal

[07:52:25.0399] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Everybody is just asking for more time

glorious

[08:47:47.0010] <Michael Ficarra>
I will mourn this proposal. It was a good proposal. I sometimes have a need for it myself. But I will not champion this proposal.

[08:48:07.0320] <bakkot>
same

[08:48:28.0835] <bakkot>
though I've been kind of trying to imagine a way to do it without new syntax

[08:48:41.0787] <bakkot>
I feel like it should be doable with a Generator.prototype method

[08:48:48.0537] <bakkot>
but haven't thought hard about it yet

[08:51:15.0883] <ljharb>
hax (HE Shi-Jun): any objection to withdrawing function.sent? if we're keeping it active, it'd be great to see it at the next plenary

[08:52:57.0098] <Caio Lima>
Regarding the option 3 on deferred re-exports, I'm worried by this behavior of throwing for optional re-exports when they are accessed if the module was not evaluated by other path. There are a couple of things I'm worried here:

1. The first point is that it will throw a runtime error only when namespace is accessed, and this can be caused by changes from library side, which will make adoption quite unsafe. I can see production code breaking because of this.
2. Second is the behavior of not throwing if it was loaded by other path, because it will insert some complexity to understand why some imports throws and others don't. This will require some analysis from dependency graph and make it hard to debug.

[09:03:38.0355] <Zb Tenerowicz (ZTZ/naugtur)>
It will end up creating race conditions. 

[09:21:08.0133] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
ljharb: I recall mentioning my plans regarding function.sent in the previous Stage 2 proposals review, but for some reason, I can't find the record in tc39 notes repo now. However, the idea at the time was to explore whether decorators could serve as a alternative solution in this problem space once decorators land and the function decorator proposal advances. Given the current status of the decorator-related proposals, I have no immediate plans to update function.sent.

[09:21:40.0426] <ljharb>
ah ok gotcha, i'd missed that update. are you ok with withdrawing it for now, and it can be restored in the future if decorators doesn't work out?

[09:39:43.0780] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
ljharb: I found the record: https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/59c6f56131851169e62051b7f292453e73cd0e92/meetings/2024-06/june-11.md?plain=1#L1037 .  And I dont like to withdraw it, but perhaps downgrading to Stage 1 would be appropriate, as the specific form of the solution might no longer be a meta property, but rather another syntactic form or a decorator-based API.

[10:03:38.0512] <ptomato>
is there a link to the import sync slides?

[10:06:10.0419] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
ljharb: I checked the notes and saw that the topic of withdrawal has already been discussed. Unfortunately, I wasn't present because my home network has been very unstable this week, and Matrix has been intermittently disconnected as well. I’m afraid I won’t be able to join the video conference for this afternoon’s meeting either—I’ll only be able to follow via the notes. However, if it’s convenient, please help clarify during the meeting that this proposal was actually updated in 2022 (though the last presented time wasn’t updated on the tc39/proposals page), and it was also presented during the 2024 proposal review, so it isn’t a case of “no activity in over a decade.” 😂

[10:13:42.0670] <bakkot>
`import.sync` feels a lot like the "synchronously unwrap a promise" proposals which occasionally come up and which many people strongly object to, just specialized to a specific kind of promise (i.e., those which are returned by dynamic import)

[10:13:58.0411] <bakkot>
it is not totally clear to me what rule justifies allowing one but not the other

[10:17:05.0624] <Michael Ficarra>
does `import.meta` work in scripts?

[10:17:16.0364] <ljharb>
no, they weren't imported

[10:17:28.0853] <Michael Ficarra>
what's it do?

[10:17:33.0497] <ljharb>
syntax error iirc

[10:18:06.0094] <ljharb>
my position isn't some arbitrary "all import.foo must work in Scripts" tbc, it's "we should bend over backwards to avoid adding something to the language that doesn't work in all supported parse goals"

[10:18:22.0644] <Michael Ficarra>
ah, you're right

[10:18:58.0818] <Zb Tenerowicz (ZTZ/naugtur)>
bakkot:  is not unwrapping a promise, it's synchronously executing a module that has its source text synchronously available for whatever reason 

[10:19:18.0516] <nicolo-ribaudo>
import defer detects deadlocks and throws, this could reuse the same infrastructure 

[10:30:26.0364] <nicolo-ribaudo>
The example I mentioned:
```js
import { didRunPromiseQueue } from "./async-check.js";
import { x } from "./tla.js";
console.log(x, didRunPromiseQueue);
```
```js
// async-check.js
let didRunPromiseQueue = false;
Promise.resolve().then(() => didRunPromiseQueue = true);
```
```js
// tla.js
await null;
export const x = 1;
```

If `tla.js` was already evaluated, it will synchronously log `x` synchronously right after running `async-check.js`, without introducing an artificial await.

[10:31:04.0658] <nicolo-ribaudo>
While if `tla.js` still needs to be evaluated, it will only log asynchronously (after `didRunPromiseQueue` becomes true) 

[10:40:54.0025] <Zb Tenerowicz (ZTZ/naugtur)>
Would import.sync cause regular import * from to also become sync?
If import.sync was to bevome an equivalent of require(esm) in node.js it would be the current behavior

[10:42:03.0805] <ptomato>
I'd appreciate it if someone could tag me out as a notetaker after this item

[10:42:04.0351] <nicolo-ribaudo>
What does it mean for `import * from` to be sync?

[10:43:03.0058] <Zb Tenerowicz (ZTZ/naugtur)>
I'm not sure. Let's consider that part of the question 

[10:47:52.0996] <Michael Ficarra>
nit: we clearly wouldn't want to ToIntegerOrInfinity the limit because that converts non-numbers using ToNumber, which goes against our normative convention

[10:48:22.0161] <Michael Ficarra>
also that's a completely unnecessary level of detail for a proposal going for stage 1 (and even 2)

[10:52:01.0247] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I recommend explicitly keeping defining what stack frames are outside of the proposal scope

[10:52:18.0297] <nicolo-ribaudo>
But what exact validation we do on the number yes no need to worry about that now

[10:54:29.0445] <Zb Tenerowicz (ZTZ/naugtur)>
Hermes (the engine behind React Native) is also emulating a subset of the non-standard Error stack mechanics from V8

[10:56:28.0691] <Michael Ficarra>
I don't understand MM's comment. This proposal is going for Stage 1 before the next proposal is presented. If the comments apply to both, shouldn't we hear them now?

[10:59:15.0232] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Maybe the limit of 0 should not be allowed

[10:59:23.0377] <nicolo-ribaudo>
So you always have some idea of where to start looking

[11:17:25.0478] <Michael Ficarra>
another related proposal: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-function-implementation-hiding

[11:24:23.0461] <ljharb>
TIL that DOMException lacks a cause

[11:24:33.0261] <ljharb>
that should be merged

[11:26:23.0290] <ljharb>
* that should really be merged

[11:26:25.0478] <Chengzhong Wu>
https://github.com/whatwg/webidl/pull/1179 was blocked due to difference on the property on the error prototype or an error instance

[11:26:34.0132] <Lea Verou>
ljharb: it does not inherit from Error either… https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-DOMException

[11:26:49.0583] <ljharb>
oof, i guess it has the slot but doesn't inherit from it

[11:27:06.0065] <Lea Verou>
The entire existence of DOMException is a wart in the platform :(

[11:27:11.0217] <Andreu Botella>
its prototype is Error.prototype: https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#js-exceptions

[11:27:16.0254] <Andreu Botella>
it just can't be represented in WebIDL

[11:28:03.0005] <ljharb>
`new DOMException() instanceof Error` checks out

[11:28:16.0207] <Lea Verou>
Andreu Botella: not in the browser implementation at least… `Object.getPrototypeOf(DOMException) === Function.prototype`…

[11:28:37.0270] <ljharb>
that's still ES5-style inheritance tho, just not `class`-style

[11:28:44.0788] <ljharb>
(sounds like web idl is a wart too, if it can't represent the web's programming language properly)

[11:28:54.0617] <Lea Verou>
* Andreu Botella: not in the browser implementation at least… `Object.getPrototypeOf(DOMException) === Function.prototype`… (edit: same in Node)

[11:29:01.0069] <ljharb>
so i guess DOMExceptions inherit from Error.prototype, but the DOMException constructor doesn't inherit from Error

[11:29:13.0998] <ljharb>
would it break anything to make it do so?

[11:30:05.0687] <Lea Verou>
Oooh, that's true, `Object.getPrototypeOf(DOMException.prototype) === Error.prototype`. How weird.

[11:31:15.0937] <Lea Verou>
The question is not just whether it would actually break anything, but also whether people can be convinced to check… 

[11:33:29.0192] <Lea Verou>
Turns out there is an issue already: https://github.com/whatwg/webidl/issues/1107

[11:36:51.0436] <ljharb>
wait so `Error.captureStackTrace(x)` exists so you don't have to `x.stack = new Error().stack`?

[11:36:53.0578] <ljharb>
* wait so `Error.captureStackTrace(x)` only exists so you don't have to `x.stack = new Error().stack`?

[11:38:12.0808] <ljharb>
* wait so `Error.captureStackTrace(x)` only exists so users didn't have to do `x.stack = new Error().stack`?

[11:40:13.0823] <Lea Verou>
Yeah that is pretty ...weird

[11:40:58.0736] <Lea Verou>
ljharb: Here's the background: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-capturestacktrace

[11:48:27.0933] <Steve Hicks>
ljharb: Specifically what needs to be updated w.r.t. GitHub teams?

[11:49:01.0371] <ljharb>
look over the list of members, and make sure everyone on the list is still employed at your company and still wants to participate; and that nobody who wants to participate is missing

[11:51:13.0585] <Steve Hicks>
Are you talking about https://github.com/orgs/tc39/people or https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/delegates.txt or something else?

[11:51:49.0038] <Andreu Botella>
https://github.com/orgs/tc39/teams/delegates/teams i think

[11:52:31.0222] <Steve Hicks>

[14:25:56.0242] <Aki>
Thank you, everyone, for your summaries and conclusions so far. Right now, I am still looking for the following:
- bakkot just a very brief summary of the 262 update
- chipmorningstar I wrote a one-sentence summary, please review and edit if needed
- Chris de Almeida summary and/or conclusion for Withdrawing Intl.UnitFormat
- guybedford Import Sync for Stage 2 slides were not linked in the agenda, also need summary of presentation/conversation and to record any decisions or conclusions
- Ruben Error option limit & Error option framesAbove are both missing slides, summaries, and conclusions

I am confused about what this "internal property" is that is not the existing `accessor` property

[07:27:22.0979] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Maybe this proposal is pointing to a need to split off accessor from the decorators proposal so that it's not blocked on them?

[07:28:12.0374] <rbuckton>
`accessor` is sort of split off. It was originally introduced in Grouped and Auto-Accessors and brought over to decorators to meet implementor requirements

[07:31:01.0501] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I think I would prefer for these things to be reified as accessors and not directly visible in descriptors, to avoid making descriptors being more complicated

What's the time box? I noticed we are almost at the hour, and my reply is low priority so I can drop it if needed

1 hour

[07:59:33.0001] <keith_miller>
nicolo-ribaudo: Which syntax were you talking about the one on the slide now with the decorator?

[07:59:59.0691] <nicolo-ribaudo>
The one with the validate keyword

[08:00:04.0604] <keith_miller>
Or the `class Foo { accessor x = 2; }` syntax?

[08:00:54.0501] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I meant that `class Foo { validate x(val) { ... } }` looks a lot like `class Foo { set x(val) { ... } }`, so I'd expect similar performance

[08:01:16.0684] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'd also expect similar perf with the decorator example, since I'm literally seeing a function attached to the property

[08:01:35.0226] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I would have less of that expectaton for a plain `accessor x = 2`, but I guess most times you'd want to decorate that anyway

[08:02:06.0910] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I wonder if `accessor x = 2` is more optimizable though, since there is no user code running there even if it's a get/set pair

[08:02:26.0091] <keith_miller>
The motivation for this, as I understand it anyway, is to use it everywhere

[08:02:48.0023] <keith_miller>
* The motivation for this, as I understand it anyway, is to use it everywhere for reflection/metaprogramming

[08:03:55.0464] <keith_miller>
Which is the reason I mentioned hiding the cost of the call. Not sure about others

[08:04:09.0575] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ok I think I was mostly focusing on the second use case, I'm not sure I agree with the first one

[08:04:13.0584] <ljharb>
only for the use cases where the instance shape is needed from outside

[08:04:44.0527] <nicolo-ribaudo>
For this could we have a bult-in `@public` decorator, with the decorators metadata proposal?

[08:04:50.0800] <nicolo-ribaudo>
That marks it as "public" in the metadata

[08:06:02.0097] <ljharb>
 true - and a class decorator could do it all in one

[08:06:04.0881] <keith_miller>
Are people realistically going to add the mental overhead of figuring that out though? My assumption would be that codebases that don't particularly care about performance would just apply it everywhere

[08:07:00.0599] <ljharb>
sure but if they don’t care about performance then it doesn’t matter there, right?

[08:07:49.0468] <bakkot>
_we_ care about performance even if they don't

[08:08:02.0400] <nicolo-ribaudo>
"people are not thinking about what things make their code slow" and "people want their code to be fast" unfortunately have a large intersection

[08:08:20.0693] <bakkot>
we should design the language such that even people who don't care about performance end up on the happy (= reasonably performant) path

[08:09:08.0765] <ljharb>
fair

[08:20:21.0576] <rbuckton>
New features aren't necessarily free, especially when we implement whole new capabilities to the language.

[08:27:02.0675] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm looking at my accessors usage, and they are (numbers are not measured):
- 75% "property forwarding"
- 15% lazy initial computation
- 10% validation
- 5% other

[08:27:27.0951] <nicolo-ribaudo>
The % symbol obviously means " / 105"

[08:27:40.0950] <rbuckton>
For point 1 in the problem statement, would we ever consider adding something like `Function.getInstanceFieldNames(ctor)`?

[08:28:14.0899] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Some feedback that was shared at last plenary is that class fields should behave similarly to properties defined in the constructor

[08:28:28.0122] <rbuckton>
You could add a proxy trap for it like `apply`/`construct`

[08:29:17.0816] <rbuckton>
I don't necessarily agree with that position, though I do agree you shouldn't be able to just grab them via `getOwnPropertyDescriptors`.

[08:30:01.0231] <rbuckton>
A `getInstanceFieldNames` would be simpler than a `@Public` decorator that uses `Symbol.metadata` to do the same thing

@rbuckton:matrix.org do your best to fix it up

[09:05:33.0903] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
Yeah I have similar usage, and I think lazy init is especially hard to expresss even with current decorator proposal. 

[09:16:56.0688] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
But if u consider validate/sideeffect use cases, it actually don't require to be use accessor but only some observer ability. Force it to become accessor have performance result (To be clear, I don't care much about perf issue, but I always hear some delegates attack some proposals use this reason).

[09:18:49.0024] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
I think lea already suggest similar proposal in last meeting and be refused? Or maybe I misunderstand it?

[09:20:42.0177] <Lea Verou>
Oooh yes, lazy init is another big one. 

[09:21:47.0389] <Lea Verou>

While most things can be done with decorators, I suspect alias accessors likely would need _some_ syntax if we want to support private members. And property chains would be a lot elegant as an actual language construct (like in `delete`) as opposed to e.g. an array of property names.

[09:21:48.0529] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
To be honest, my question is, whether decorator could really go to stage 4, considering the position of browser vendors? (If there was any news on that, pls tell me...)

[09:23:00.0018] <Lea Verou>
Another advantage of the decorators direction is that it's a lower-cost way to prototype and test the waters. E.g. if this ends up being used tremendously much, we could introduce a syntax-level solution *down the line*. For this alone, I'm actually now myself in favor of the decorators direction

`@lazy accessor x = lazy.of(() => init)` // example provided by Jack Works 
Full of syntax noise 🙃

[09:25:00.0630] <rbuckton>
Which paragraph?

[09:25:06.0935] <Lea Verou>
hax (HE Shi-Jun): it doesn't need to, it could be `let { lazy } = SomeObject` and then just `@lazy(init) accessor x` . I'm less worried about O(1) DX issues, it's the O(N) (per property) DX issues that are the main problem 

[09:28:28.0271] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
I'm afraid @lazy(init) does not work if u want to access something on the instance in initializer?

[09:31:24.0922] <nicolo-ribaudo>
`@lazy accessor x = () => init`?

[09:36:12.0976] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
I think u can't make it type safe in ts. Though it maybe the fault of TS 😆

[09:38:07.0655] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
Anyway, I really feel lazy init is too common and should have better DX. If u check other morden langauge, in Kotlin u write `var x by lazy { ... }`, in swift u write `lazy var x = { ... }()`, in cala u write `lazy val x = { ... }`. It's shame that we can't provide js programmers a 

[09:38:20.0230] <ljharb>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> A `getInstanceFieldNames` would be simpler than a `@Public` decorator that uses `Symbol.metadata` to do the same thing

it is critically important that it be opt in and not available by default.

[09:39:17.0015] <Lea Verou>
hax (HE Shi-Jun): A way I often implement lazy accessors myself is to set a symbol property in the getter and just return that if set. I believe that can totally be done with decorators, right?

[09:39:38.0922] <Steve Hicks>
That's my point about well-known builtin decorators - TypeScript could learn the type calculus behind them.

[09:44:26.0249] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
Obviously 10 js developers can have 10 different way to do it. If u ask GPT it may teach u write `class C { get val() { Object.defineProperty(this, 'val', { value: expensive(), writable: false }); return this.val; } }`

[09:45:26.0994] <Lea Verou>
Yes, but if it's a built-in decorator that's not an issue

[09:46:32.0683] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
I'm very curious how engine vendors see such re-defining prop descriptor which LLM like to encourage but they refused in decorator proposal.

[09:52:55.0054] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
Is there any specific reason that it should be opt in? And what opt-in mechnism will u like to see?

(my version is to let TypeScript happy, otherwise it can be @lazy accessor x = () => init

[10:01:00.0349] <rbuckton>
It's certainly feasible for TS to implement. It's on the backlog and I planned to work on it at some point.

we should do this every time – maybe excluding first-timers

[10:06:00.0632] <ljharb>
because anything that's introspectable is part of the public API and a breaking change if altered. i don't care what the mechanism is, it just has to be solely up to the class author.

* because anything that's introspectable is part of the public API and a breaking change if altered. i don't care what the mechanism is, it just has to be solely up to the class author.

separately, public class fields are sugar for statements in the constructor, and statements inside function bodies are *never* introspectable in the language, nor should they be.

[10:06:58.0439] <Aki>
the only reason the chairs haven't done that in the past (at https://takingnotes.rocks) is that there are some people who can't for personal reasons and it's not fair to put them on the spot

[10:07:28.0181] <rbuckton>
Isn't that why we have private fields? public fields are introspectable on an instance, just not from a constructor. IMO, you shouldn't need to construct an instance for that introspection.

[10:07:50.0041] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I mean the chairs could do the extraction privately, and those people can privately ask them in advance to be excluded

[10:08:12.0087] <ljharb>
nope, they're not. public _properties_ on the resulting instance are, certainly. but the existence of a field does not guarantee it will end up as a property, nor will the list of fields be exhaustive.

[10:08:23.0732] <ljharb>
* nope, they're not. public _properties_ on the resulting instance are, certainly. but the existence of a field does not guarantee it will end up as a property, nor will the list of fields be exhaustive (meaning there could eventually be properties not in that list).

(remember any subclass can arbitrarily delete a property that a field created, for example)

[10:10:46.0763] <rbuckton>
A field declaration will definitely guarantee its presence as a data property. They are always installed on an instance (barring use of `delete`, which is rarely a good idea).

[10:11:06.0913] <ljharb>
ok but the existence of that caveat means that it's not a guarantee.

[10:11:07.0207] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
But u already can use Object.getOwnPropertyNames() or other api or syntax to get the own properties... I don't see any difference here (except u can only get them via object not class).

[10:11:17.0909] <ljharb>
*of the instance*. you can't do that from a constructor alone.

[10:11:37.0677] <ljharb>
nor should you be able to, without the permission of the class author.

[10:11:49.0869] <rbuckton>
You can `delete` methods and accessors as well

[10:11:55.0265] <ljharb>
indeed you can

[10:12:04.0035] <ljharb>
but that you can introspect on the class.

[10:12:23.0254] <ljharb>
overall, implicit reflection/introspection is a horrifically bad language "feature" and we should go out of our way to not introduce any additional cases of it.

[10:12:46.0550] <ljharb>
explicit/opt-in reflection is great though! i fully support an author's freedom to expose what they want. but it must be a choice.

[10:13:01.0554] <rbuckton>
I strongly disagree with that sentiment.

[10:13:03.0019] <ljharb>
* explicit/opt-in reflection is great though! i fully support an author's freedom to expose what they want. but it must be a choice. (ideally it's an easy one, just explicit)

[10:13:11.0060] <ljharb>
that is unsurprising :-)

[10:13:57.0496] <ljharb>
but suffice to say there's no consensus to add any new implicit/default introspection mechanisms, though.

[10:14:18.0669] <rbuckton>
IMO, it's a terrible idea to use `delete` on any member of a class.

[10:14:22.0823] <ljharb>
oh i agree

[10:14:42.0761] <ljharb>
lots of things in any language are a terrible idea. but they still exist.

[10:14:54.0364] <rbuckton>
And you certainly won't be able to `delete` fields from `struct` instances.

[10:15:04.0833] <ljharb>
which is great

[10:15:15.0991] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
ljharb: " public class fields are sugar for statements in the constructor, and ..." --- No they are not sugar. No one write "Object.defineOwnProperty(this, "name", ...) in constructor. 😂

[10:15:26.0941] <ljharb>
that nobody writes it is *why* it's sugar

[10:15:39.0399] <ljharb>
and prior to the [[Define]] decision it was sugar for the thing *everyone* writes, which is `this.foo = 'bar'`

[10:17:27.0074] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
Ok. I mean, no one want to [[Define]] before this feature, so it's really weird to me to see it as sugar. I always see sugar should not introduce uncommon semantic.

[10:18:24.0456] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh well I can't speak sorry.

It's for Trusted Types, it is being implemented 

[10:19:16.0106] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It's not ready for stage 4 yet though, according to my colleague working on it 

[10:21:16.0738] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
ljharb: On the other side, why it should be opt-in but not opt-out?? For example, in TS you use `private x` which seems match the case you want (by default it's public api, but private means it's not public)

[10:26:03.0443] <keith_miller>
Can uhh, I convince one of the chairs to add the 3.md agenda so I can add Atomics.pause to stage 4 before I forget... :)

[10:26:50.0102] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
ljharb: To be clear, I think opt-in is ok, I even like everything is not public by default, but JS class already make methods public, it's really weird that only fields need to opt-in for public.

[10:29:38.0205] <ljharb>
TS's `private` is bad for a ton of reasons so i don't think it should be used as an argument

[10:30:02.0629] <ljharb>
because a "field" isn't a first-class thing. a field is just instructions to set up a property - which is indeed public by default.

[10:30:07.0988] <ljharb>
* because a "field" isn't a first-class thing. a field is just instructions to set up a property - which is indeed public by default. iow, it's sugar.

[10:30:54.0100] <ljharb>
yes, i will do that now

[10:34:45.0459] <Zb Tenerowicz (ZTZ/naugtur)>
I might be interested in co-championing ljharb: but will need a comprehensive intro

[10:39:36.0464] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
I am not sure what "first-class" means. In my opinion, the whole point of fields proposal is to make it declarative and get the "first-class" support in the language.
