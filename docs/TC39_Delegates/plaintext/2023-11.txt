i think torque could support suspend points natively with a desugaring

[18:00:27.0639] <snek>
this was one of the things i had in mind when i originally suggested the builtin async functions/generators

[18:40:29.0736] <shu>
by all means, i'd love someone to implement it

How long has test262.report been down for? are there plans to bring it back up?

[03:54:00.0400] <nicolo-ribaudo>
test262.fyi :)

Aaaahhh

base64 proposal is updated to remove streaming, fill out spec text, and settle outstanding questions about the API: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-base64

see playground for overview and a polyfill in the console: https://tc39.es/proposal-arraybuffer-base64/

other than removing streaming, the most significant change is that the base64 decoder is now permissive by default (ignores whitespace, does not require padding), with a `strict: true` options bag argument which makes it strict (does not allow whitespace, enforces padding)

would appreciate eyes on it, and especially if anyone wants to volunteer to review before the November plenary so I can ask for stage 3 (assuming Peter no longer objects); otherwise I'll be asking in January

[09:09:19.0031] <ljharb>
I’ll volunteer to review

Now that we have dates & time zones for the next meetings, could we add them to the calendar?

[10:39:26.0580] <nicolo-ribaudo>
(or I can do it by myself but I don't know how to add events to the calendar)

[14:18:56.0001] <ljharb>
i'll make sure they're on there
