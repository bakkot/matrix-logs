made that matrix log bot I promised: https://bakkot.github.io/matrix-logs/

[18:23:23.0046] <bakkot>
I'm probably only going to have it update once an hour or something

[22:50:03.0606] <ryzokuken>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> made that matrix log bot I promised: https://bakkot.github.io/matrix-logs/

super awesome! thanks!

[08:13:38.0096] <littledan>
bakkot: Huh, can you make it scrape the logs from back before it started and present those as well?

[08:23:28.0058] <bakkot>
littledan: it does that

[09:03:10.0153] <littledan>
bakkot: oh, is there a way to get the whole log, not just the log for a particular day?

[09:24:28.0180] <bakkot>
littledan: not as yet. the whole log can get very long, so you'd want to paginate, which you can do from https://view.matrix.org/room/!WgJwmjBNZEXhJnXHXw:matrix.org/

[09:24:41.0178] <bakkot>
you can also clone the repo which hosts them I guess: https://github.com/bakkot/matrix-logs

[09:31:53.0440] <littledan>
well, yeah, Waldemar's specific request was to have the complete log

[09:31:56.0733] <littledan>
we already had the paginated log

[09:32:49.0798] <bakkot>
we never had that for IRC, as far as I recall; this log works almost exactly like IRC log bots do

[09:32:57.0465] <bakkot>
but sure, I can also generate a text file with everything in it

[09:33:52.0265] <bakkot>
I assumed he just wanted the ability to view old logs without clicking "load more" an indeterminate and increasing number of times

[09:33:56.0798] <bakkot>
that's what I wanted, at any rate

[09:42:11.0729] <littledan>
I don't quite understand the motivation for the request; it's possible I was misunderstanding. Probably best to follow up with him.

[09:42:31.0116] <littledan>
I think the "show more" links already fulfilled the requirement that the logs be publicly accessible

[09:43:49.0733] <shu>
littledan: what i thought waldemar was asking for is a downloadable text file he can grep through locally

[09:47:30.0050] <littledan>
shu: What I don't understand is why this is a requirement when, as bakkot said, this did not quite exist for IRC

[09:47:59.0508] <littledan>
it seems like an achievable thing to provide, though

[09:48:00.0782] <shu>
oh that i don't know either

[09:48:08.0266] <shu>
maybe he was relying on irccloud's log export or something

[09:48:17.0520] <bakkot>
Yeah, it'll be straightforward, I might as well

[09:48:37.0800] <shu>
hm apparently setting an svg as a profile picture doesn't work

[11:47:02.0351] <ryzokuken>
shu: I could see your picture before and I can still see it...

[11:47:25.0284] <ryzokuken>
oh wait, I saw it before in another room, nvm

[12:01:46.0696] <shu>
i've changed it to a png

[12:01:53.0345] <shu>
(of the same picture)

[20:12:45.0932] <bakkot>
littledan: plaintext logs are now available, binned by month; hopefully that makes everyone happy

[20:13:00.0940] <bakkot>
if not I will iterate after people get a chance to voice objections next meeting

for the inclusion group I'm trying to document on what the chairs' responsibilities are as matrix channel admins;

 * for the inclusion group I'm trying to document what the chairs' responsibilities are as matrix channel admins; 

[09:50:29.0226] <ptomato>
e.g. giving delegates the appropriate permissions in this channel

[09:50:35.0551] <ptomato>
does it go to the chairs when someone clicks "Report content" on a message?

[09:51:13.0740] <ptomato>
do the chairs moderate the channels and mute/ban spammers and trolls?

[09:51:58.0099] <ptomato>
Aki: bterlson: Rob Palmer: let me know if you can think of other matrix admin responsibilities that the chairs should have

[09:52:47.0966] <ptomato>
(and we have some non-chair admins as well; is this temporary or is it good for the chairs to delegate admin-ship to volunteers?)

[09:52:58.0586] <Rob Palmer>
i would hope CoC folk also have ability to moderate

devsnek: did you ever land the tailcall branch in engine262?

[13:28:27.0284] <rickbutton>
I know that there was mention of test262.report in the last tc39 but don't remember the resolution, looks like it is still down, expected?

[14:25:53.0790] <bakkot>
rickbutton: this was just discussed in #tc39-general:matrix.org 

[14:26:00.0299] <bakkot>

sidebar: how does completion for rooms work in element? I can start typing `#tc3` and get a popup, which I can navigate with arrows or tab and exit with `esc`, but I can't figure out how to confirm - enter selects and also sends the message, which is not what I want

[16:45:58.0238] <tabatkins>
bakkot: hit space


2021-06-09
[19:37:32.0605] <bakkot>
tabatkins: aha, thank you

[21:52:48.0001] <ryzokuken>
bakkot: if you've selected using tab or arrows, you can just move on and type what you need. No need to confirm, the selection would disappear as soon as you type (which applies if you press space too).

shu: The delegates meeting is happening right now, right?

[09:08:00.0419] <tabatkins>
Or wait, now I'm confused; the email said "Finalizing the time to June 10, 9:00 - 10:00 AM PDT." but the gh issue says "June 17" 

[09:12:06.0367] <tabatkins>
Ah, found the issue. @shu fyi for next time, don't *just* edit comments with important new information, because edits aren't reflected into email. Edit *and* post a new comment, plz

AFAICT, unless the issue title is updated, the email title won't change. So edit the issue title will help in the condition too.
