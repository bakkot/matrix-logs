made that matrix log bot I promised: https://bakkot.github.io/matrix-logs/

[18:23:23.0046] <bakkot>
I'm probably only going to have it update once an hour or something

> <@bakkot:matrix.org> made that matrix log bot I promised: https://bakkot.github.io/matrix-logs/

super awesome! thanks!

[08:13:38.0096] <littledan>
bakkot: Huh, can you make it scrape the logs from back before it started and present those as well?

[08:23:28.0058] <bakkot>
littledan: it does that

[09:03:10.0153] <littledan>
bakkot: oh, is there a way to get the whole log, not just the log for a particular day?

[09:24:28.0180] <bakkot>
littledan: not as yet. the whole log can get very long, so you'd want to paginate, which you can do from https://view.matrix.org/room/!WgJwmjBNZEXhJnXHXw:matrix.org/

[09:24:41.0178] <bakkot>
you can also clone the repo which hosts them I guess: https://github.com/bakkot/matrix-logs

[09:31:53.0440] <littledan>
well, yeah, Waldemar's specific request was to have the complete log

[09:31:56.0733] <littledan>
we already had the paginated log

[09:32:49.0798] <bakkot>
we never had that for IRC, as far as I recall; this log works almost exactly like IRC log bots do

[09:32:57.0465] <bakkot>
but sure, I can also generate a text file with everything in it

[09:33:52.0265] <bakkot>
I assumed he just wanted the ability to view old logs without clicking "load more" an indeterminate and increasing number of times

[09:33:56.0798] <bakkot>
that's what I wanted, at any rate

[09:42:11.0729] <littledan>
I don't quite understand the motivation for the request; it's possible I was misunderstanding. Probably best to follow up with him.

[09:42:31.0116] <littledan>
I think the "show more" links already fulfilled the requirement that the logs be publicly accessible

[09:43:49.0733] <shu>
littledan: what i thought waldemar was asking for is a downloadable text file he can grep through locally

[09:47:30.0050] <littledan>
shu: What I don't understand is why this is a requirement when, as bakkot said, this did not quite exist for IRC

[09:47:59.0508] <littledan>
it seems like an achievable thing to provide, though

[09:48:00.0782] <shu>
oh that i don't know either

[09:48:08.0266] <shu>
maybe he was relying on irccloud's log export or something

[09:48:17.0520] <bakkot>
Yeah, it'll be straightforward, I might as well

[09:48:37.0800] <shu>
hm apparently setting an svg as a profile picture doesn't work

[11:47:02.0351] <ryzokuken>
shu: I could see your picture before and I can still see it...

[11:47:25.0284] <ryzokuken>
oh wait, I saw it before in another room, nvm

[12:01:46.0696] <shu>
i've changed it to a png

[12:01:53.0345] <shu>
(of the same picture)

littledan: plaintext logs are now available, binned by month; hopefully that makes everyone happy

[20:13:00.0940] <bakkot>
if not I will iterate after people get a chance to voice objections next meeting
