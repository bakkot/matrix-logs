Michael Ficarra: did you intend step 5 of https://tc39.es/proposal-iterator-helpers/#sec-iteratorprototype.reduce to be "not present", as in an arguments length check? it is consistent with Array.prototype.reduce, but is generally weirder than just checking for undefined nowadays

[16:06:41.0132] <Michael Ficarra>
hmm, yeah it seems like the right call, as that's how we distinguish two pretty radically different behaviors

[16:07:27.0736] <Michael Ficarra>
reduce can either be passed the initial memo (which is perfectly reasonable to be `undefined`) or it can assume the structure is non-empty and use the first element as the initial memo

[16:07:52.0971] <Michael Ficarra>
I think a presence check is the only thing we can do short of separating `reduce` and `reduce1`

[16:07:59.0791] <shu>
ah good point, undefined is a good initial value, so the only choice here is an arguments length check

[16:08:03.0593] <shu>
thanks

Yeah, reduce() def needs the presence check rather than undefinedness.

shu: FYI there's another 2 iterator helper topics added to the May agenda

[18:33:23.0766] <Michael Ficarra>
they're some minor inconsistencies that I discovered while working on the tests

[18:34:12.0075] <Michael Ficarra>
the slides should be self-explanatory

[18:45:19.0695] <shu>
do they really need 30 minutes each

[18:47:36.0715] <Michael Ficarra>
hopefully not

[18:51:29.0580] <Michael Ficarra>
does anyone remember a discussion about whether `const [] = { [Symbol.iterator]() { return {}; } };` (a malformed iterator that never gets iterated) should throw?

[18:51:39.0298] <Michael Ficarra>
I vaguely remember Justin Ridgewell being involved I think

[18:53:37.0986] <Michael Ficarra>
bakkot found it! https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1288#issuecomment-424457388

[18:53:38.0759] <Justin Ridgewell>
We discussed whether a malformed iterator would close the underlying
