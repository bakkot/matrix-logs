Michael Ficarra: did you intend step 5 of https://tc39.es/proposal-iterator-helpers/#sec-iteratorprototype.reduce to be "not present", as in an arguments length check? it is consistent with Array.prototype.reduce, but is generally weirder than just checking for undefined nowadays

[16:06:41.0132] <Michael Ficarra>
hmm, yeah it seems like the right call, as that's how we distinguish two pretty radically different behaviors

[16:07:27.0736] <Michael Ficarra>
reduce can either be passed the initial memo (which is perfectly reasonable to be `undefined`) or it can assume the structure is non-empty and use the first element as the initial memo

[16:07:52.0971] <Michael Ficarra>
I think a presence check is the only thing we can do short of separating `reduce` and `reduce1`

[16:07:59.0791] <shu>
ah good point, undefined is a good initial value, so the only choice here is an arguments length check

thanks
