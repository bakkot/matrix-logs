Can I get write access to test262?

[13:58:52.0185] <Justin Ridgewell>
Trying to update the group/groupToMap PRs made by another contributor, but I can't push without access.

Justin Ridgewell: i just added you with write access, in theory CODEOWNERS should prevent you from merging but Write should allow you to force push to the PR; please lmk if theory doesn't hold

[09:28:51.0497] <Justin Ridgewell>
Thanks

< 24 hours to get your agenda items in for the next meeting! Looks like this will be a short one unless folks are waiting for the last possible second.

ljharb (or any admin): can I be given write access to https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods? ðŸ˜…

[15:20:57.0381] <ljharb>
done

[16:48:49.0262] <bakkot>
ljharb re https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/issues/117#issuecomment-1235980915 "i'd prefer it brand-check" - what do you actually want it to brand check?

[16:49:05.0131] <bakkot>
I'm confused about what the ask is

[16:58:02.0516] <ljharb>
instances of iterator

[16:58:17.0160] <ljharb>
so it throws if anyone extracts the getter and dot calls it on something different

[18:18:56.0824] <bakkot>
so an `instanceof` check, you mean? that doesn't seem that useful; you can do that yourself

[22:05:49.0750] <ljharb>
no, not an instanceof check, those are forgeable and don't work across realms. a brand check.

[09:00:22.0548] <bakkot>
ljharb: what brand do you imagine checking? there are a bunch of different built-in iterators in the language and the web platform, and they don't have a common brand

[09:00:46.0177] <bakkot>
the whole point of iterator being an interface is that the interface is implemented by a bunch of different classes, including userland classes

[09:02:50.0840] <littledan>
IMO the appropriate level for a brand check here would be to revert the whole Symbol.toStringTag change in the first place... what a bad idea of a feature. Not clear if it makes sense to "chip away at it" as much as I'm sympathetic with the idea to try.

[09:06:01.0455] <littledan>
it's not unthinkable to add a brand just for this purpose in https://tc39.es/proposal-iterator-helpers/#sec-iterator but I don't see the point

[09:06:41.0126] <littledan>
(do we want to start telling people, they shouldn't be pasting iterator helpers onto a base class by messing with a prototype chain? that seems like a useful mode to me)

they do have a common brand now, itâ€™s what Iterator.from provides

[18:42:40.0929] <ljharb>
and a userland class will be wrapped by a branded object.

[08:36:39.0724] <bakkot>
Iterator.from checks `instanceof Iterator` and returns the original object if that returns true

[08:36:52.0231] <bakkot>
so no, it does not provide a common brand

[08:37:01.0436] <bakkot>
 * so no, it does not provide a common brand

[10:33:56.0875] <snek>
without first class protocols the only ways to check if something is an actual iterator is either rely on the prototype or exhaustively interrogate its methods
