Can I get write access to test262?

[13:58:52.0185] <Justin Ridgewell>
Trying to update the group/groupToMap PRs made by another contributor, but I can't push without access.

Justin Ridgewell: i just added you with write access, in theory CODEOWNERS should prevent you from merging but Write should allow you to force push to the PR; please lmk if theory doesn't hold

Thanks

< 24 hours to get your agenda items in for the next meeting! Looks like this will be a short one unless folks are waiting for the last possible second.

ljharb (or any admin): can I be given write access to https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods? ðŸ˜…

[15:20:57.0381] <ljharb>
done

ljharb re https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/issues/117#issuecomment-1235980915 "i'd prefer it brand-check" - what do you actually want it to brand check?

[16:49:05.0131] <bakkot>
I'm confused about what the ask is

[16:58:02.0516] <ljharb>
instances of iterator

[16:58:17.0160] <ljharb>
so it throws if anyone extracts the getter and dot calls it on something different
