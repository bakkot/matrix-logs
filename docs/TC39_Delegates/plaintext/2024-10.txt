I really hope over time the spec is allowed to change the number of ticks some things take. I believe we did so for async function return already

[21:41:49.0861] <rkirsling>
shu: did you mean to leave this needs-consensus topic just titled by its number on the agenda? 🤔

[21:48:52.0350] <ljharb>
yes, that’s intentional 

[22:31:15.0770] <rkirsling>
these map.emplace slides are so pretty

[22:31:23.0839] <rkirsling>
nice work dminor 

[01:13:35.0007] <rkirsling>
and shu's presentation is totally gonna be a show-stealer, I'm excited for this 😁

[13:44:09.0692] <Chris de Almeida>
copypasting Rob's message from the reflector:

[13:44:48.0527] <Chris de Almeida>
The agenda continues to fill with content and is beyond our capacity. There's roughly 20 hours of agenda content and 16 hours of meeting time to fit it in. So we are over budget by about 4 hours. Sometimes we recover an hour or two, but not four.

## Actions

### More Time

Our hosts are happy for us to continue until 5pm each day, so I propose we extend Thursday to finish at 5pm instead of finishing at 4pm.

### Less Content

To everyone that has placed items on the agenda, please consider voluntary actions to mitigate the capacity problem. For example you could:

- Mark your item as low priority by adding a ⬇️ icon to the agenda.
  - This means we will only get to it if time permits.
- Reduce the timebox.
  - You can express the timebox as a range if you wish. The upper limit of which should ideally not be higher than the original request.
- Remove the item entirely if there is no harm deferring it to the next meeting which is at the start of December.

[15:27:17.0123] <Michael Ficarra>
alright I added lower bounds to my items' timeboxes, hope that helps with scheduling

The Teams call is up! Please rember to NOT sign into Teams itself. Join the call as a guest.

[18:27:21.0381] <littledan>
We have 4 slots for non-ordinary members in ExeCom

[18:27:42.0569] <littledan>
there are more slots than current members. I encourage everyone to join!

[18:32:13.0120] <shu>
Chris de Almeida: the wintercg vote

[18:34:14.0911] <Chris de Almeida>
shu: maybe DE can elaborate, but my understanding is that they are going to fully move to Ecma, rather than have the split of the CG vs WG

[18:34:38.0630] <Chris de Almeida>
the IPR concerns were due to doing some things in w3c and then some things in ecma and that was problematic

[18:34:57.0430] <shu>
last time that move was voted on and the vote failed due to IPR concerns. i am asking a clarification on what has changed since then

[18:35:08.0329] <shu>
because what i hear internally is "it's pending legal review", and aki's presentation makes it sound like it's a done thing

[18:35:10.0815] <canadahonk>
I can talk on this if people want

[18:35:32.0586] <canadahonk>
> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> shu: maybe DE can elaborate, but my understanding is that they are going to fully move to Ecma, rather than have the split of the CG vs WG

but this is the tl;dr yeah

[18:36:10.0733] <littledan>
If you're interested in the founding documents, please let me know and I'll send them to you. I've already sent to Chris Wilson and Tantek Celik, in addition to the Ecma ExeCom.

[18:36:40.0005] <shu>
specifically i'm wondering are you doing the thing where you're sending all the contributors IP transfer documents or whatever

[18:36:59.0953] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> specifically i'm wondering are you doing the thing where you're sending all the contributors IP transfer documents or whatever

yes, and this is OK since it's a one-time thing rather than an ongoing operation

[18:37:12.0198] <shu>
is that thign pending legal review from the original folks who raised the IP concerns

[18:38:33.0123] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> is that thign pending legal review from the original folks who raised the IP concerns

I don't know who it's pending legal review from. The people who raised concerns previously who I've been able to follow up with were positive about this version. I haven't been able to follow up with everyone.

[18:40:04.0866] <shu>
i'm assuming at least mozilla and google legal

[18:43:04.0757] <bakkot>
fwiw the audio sounds fine on the call

[18:45:57.0350] <Aki>
Someone wanna drop that screenshot of TCQ questions for me so I can answer them here?

[18:46:20.0301] <Chris de Almeida>
we shouldn't paste here

[18:46:23.0512] <shu>
(mine was answered in the chat just now)

[18:47:11.0163] <canadahonk>
> <@akirose:matrix.org> Someone wanna drop that screenshot of TCQ questions for me so I can answer them here?

I don't think there was anything else not already answered here (just re tc55 original proposal ipr things)

[18:47:58.0417] <Aki>
Chris de Almeida sent me the screenshot (thanks!)

[18:48:13.0405] <Ashley Claymore>
Ben: when you get a chance could you add a slides link to the agenda

[18:48:23.0462] <Ben>
Doing now

[18:48:39.0665] <littledan>
suggestion for Mozilla's concerns about being able to review the agenda: We require all agenda items to be added before the deadline, unless there is a particular "emergency"/reason for why the addition was delayed. We strongly encourage slides, repos or other supporting materials to be added to the agenda before the deadline or soon after it, with their contents done as early as possible.

[18:56:37.0462] <yulia>
the suggestions dan made above (slides & content must be available) makes a lot of sense. I would also suggest (to avoid issues in the future) that we move the deadline to 14 days (in line with ecma), and we have an indication of the amount of work (in hours) so far added to the meeting. We can't approve what we don't review, and we want to make sure that the output of tc39 is as high as possible. I think that is a shared goal. If we can plan our meeting a bit better I think it would help. 

[18:57:06.0918] <yulia>
I am not sure if many delegates are reviewing all proposal before the meeting, but it is a requirement for us as implementers, because if something lands and we didn't really think about it -- we are left holding the bag

[18:57:40.0756] <Chris de Almeida>
Ecma rules say 21 days

[18:57:45.0205] <ljharb>
fwiw those suggestions are already the case. supporting materials that aren't in by the deadline allows prodecural blocking

[18:57:46.0944] <yulia>
ah my mistake

[18:57:50.0440] <ljharb>
 * fwiw those suggestions are already the case. supporting materials that aren't in by the deadline allows procedural blocking

[18:58:04.0285] <ljharb>
 * fwiw those suggestions are already the case. supporting materials that aren't in by the deadline allows for procedural blocking

[18:58:20.0553] <littledan>
we've confirmed with Ecma in the past that TC39 may adopt its own deadline (otherwise I would've worked on getting the rules changed). But 14 days seems reasonable to me.

[18:58:22.0130] <shu>
at least for proposals 2.7+ i think an earlier deadline makes sense

[18:58:28.0969] <Aki>
yeah i was having a conversation the other day about this and surprised to discover TC39's deadline was different from Ecma's, i totally forgot

[18:58:31.0934] <yulia>
the current 5 working days that we have to fully review all of the proposals was not enough

[18:58:32.0267] <ljharb>
i'm not sure how we could calculate how much review work is needed, because it won't correlate with timebox time

[18:59:18.0434] <ljharb>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> at least for proposals 2.7+ i think an earlier deadline makes sense

i'd assume the largest review is needed for a stage 2 advancement, and the smallest for a stage 0 → 1 or 2.7 → 3 or 3 → 4

[18:59:33.0328] <ljharb>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> at least for proposals 2.7+ i think an earlier deadline makes sense

 * i'd assume the largest review is needed for 1 → 2 or 2 → 2.7, and the smallest for a stage 0 → 1 or 2.7 → 3 or 3 → 4

[19:00:00.0430] <shu>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> i'd assume the largest review is needed for 1 → 2 or 2 → 2.7, and the smallest for a stage 0 → 1 or 2.7 → 3 or 3 → 4

the 2->2.7 is the biggest one IMO, because that's starting to approach the "impls left holding the bag in case of things missed during review"

[19:00:16.0250] <shu>
so at least in terms of irreversible consequences

[19:00:26.0603] <yulia>
yeah 2->2.7 is the biggest, that means that things that are not that, end up getting the short end of the stick

[19:00:26.0967] <ljharb>
so given that, requiring an earlier deadline for attempting to enter 2 or 2.7 might make sense

[19:00:37.0776] <bakkot>
fwiw I also did not notice that the agenda item contained "TG4: Source Map Specification, 2024 edition approval (30m, Jonathan Kuperman)"

[19:00:39.0185] <ljharb>
 * so given that, requiring an earlier deadline for attempting to enter 2 or 2.7 might make sense (no need to require it for the others)

[19:00:47.0641] <bakkot>
mostly because I do not look at the task group updates section

[19:00:48.0049] <Chris de Almeida>
I don't have strong feelings on this but I do not want a complex rules engine for which deadlines apply to which stages

[19:01:05.0947] <yulia>
same, i would say just an earlier deadline allowing more than 5 days of review time

[19:01:10.0217] <shu>
then we probably do want to move the deadline up earlier for all proposals

[19:01:17.0648] <littledan>
> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> I don't have strong feelings on this but I do not want a complex rules engine for which deadlines apply to which stages

I agree, I'd prefer to have a single deadline to apply to all agenda items, not just advancement requests

[19:01:35.0666] <Chris de Almeida>
+1

[19:01:37.0222] <ljharb>
we have never had a deadline for non-advancements and i don't think we should start now

[19:01:50.0487] <yulia>
i believe we are only discussing advancement deadlines

[19:02:04.0364] <Chris de Almeida>
I think it would remain a 'best effort' thing, not a 'you missed the boat, sorry' thing

[19:02:19.0777] <ljharb>
the word "deadline" refers to the latter ime

[19:02:30.0323] <Chris de Almeida>
but it's very helpful if everything is in before the given date

[19:02:33.0239] <ljharb>
 * the word "deadline" refers to the latter ime ("dead" being a somewhat final state)

[19:02:34.0472] <littledan>
well, I raised non-advancement-requests, but I can accept if we don't adopt the policy that I suggested

[19:02:41.0892] <Chris de Almeida>
and the later things get added, the more problems it creates

[19:02:55.0388] <yulia>
yeah, with the risk of something beling blocked -- i mean it would be the same situation as now, but with 2 weeks (10 days of working time, if there are no holidays) would go a long way here 

[19:03:20.0286] <littledan>
adding something to the TC39 agenda is asking everyone to take time to focus together on a topic, so I think it's not too much for it to apply to everything. It will help us to be more effective if we have all supporting materials for all items ahead of a deadline.

[19:03:21.0926] <ljharb>
part of the reason we wanted to keep the deadline short in the past is that there's only 2 months between plenaries

[19:03:42.0781] <ljharb>
those extra 4 days have been very helpful in the past to get ducks in a row for an upcoming plenary

[19:07:04.0495] <yulia>
That said, since we meet so frequently, spilling over to the next meeting isn't a huge delay.

[19:07:18.0080] <rkirsling>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> fwiw I also did not notice that the agenda item contained "TG4: Source Map Specification, 2024 edition approval (30m, Jonathan Kuperman)"

I am actually confused whether this is the appropriate timing for a topic of this nature

[19:07:30.0343] <ljharb>
2 months is a significant delay, but 4 days doesn't seem like one to me

[19:07:31.0796] <rkirsling>
like, 30m topic in the 5m topics section

[19:07:48.0632] <Ashley Claymore>
Current doc for advancement to Stage 1 says:

> Such proposals must link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.

[19:07:56.0985] <yulia>
the time taken in those 4 days, vs incomplete review and missing something, the cost of the latter is much higher

[19:08:10.0559] <Ashley Claymore>
maybe we should make that should a must

[19:08:17.0677] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> those extra 4 days have been very helpful in the past to get ducks in a row for an upcoming plenary

I think that logic made sense at the time, but as the committee grew and we got more topics on the agenda, the tradeoff shifts, as yulia says

[19:08:45.0733] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm not following the chat,   but if it's for source map: it would be a 6 months delay and not 2 months, due to the GA meeting twice per year

[19:08:53.0119] <rkirsling>
> <@aclaymore:matrix.org> maybe we should make that should a must

I feel like I remember having a conversation in which I suggested this and we landed on "should" instead somehow...or something

[19:08:57.0831] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@aclaymore:matrix.org> maybe we should make that should a must

I think it's fine to have reduced requirements for Stage 1

[19:09:42.0954] <Aki>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> I'm not following the chat,   but if it's for source map: it would be a 6 months delay and not 2 months, due to the GA meeting twice per year

Two months here refers to stage advancement

[19:10:19.0447] <littledan>
overall, the wording in the agenda doc has encouraged people to not bother to especially try to get things into the agenda ahead of time, even when they maybe could've. It's been confusing for me to explain to people that they really should put everything there earlier, and I've had to clarify that lots of times.

[19:10:25.0143] <nicolo-ribaudo>
littledan Btw, the reason we were thinking about the license for the spec itself, is that both ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 are published underm Ecma's BSD version

 * littledan Btw, the reason we were thinking about the license for the spec itself, is that both ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 are published under Ecma's BSD version

> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> littledan Btw, the reason we were thinking about the license for the spec itself, is that both ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 are published under Ecma's BSD version

Ecma has one BSD version for test262 at https://ecma-international.org/policies/by-ipr/ecma-international-policy-on-submission-inclusion-and-licensing-of-software/ ; the alternative copyright notice at https://ecma-international.org/policies/by-ipr/ecma-text-copyright-policy/ (second section) seems broadly BSD-like, but somewhat different text, which is why I was confused. I imagine you're working on the latter relicensing (I don't really understand why it's not implicit based on Google+Mozilla's agreements with Ecma, but the lawyers will known better)

[19:16:42.0832] <Chengzhong Wu>
do we have a slides link to TG5 Report?

[19:18:49.0702] <bakkot>
yes

[19:23:12.0241] <bakkot>
I strongly agree with Michael's point that we should never switch on iterability for any reason other than to throw for non-iterables

[19:23:14.0180] <rbuckton>
auto-wrapping is a footgun that required a special symbol to workaround for Array.prototype.concat. We shouldn't repeat that mistake

[19:24:40.0979] <ljharb>
that isn't why isConcatSpreadable exists, it exists so DOM NodeLists can explain their special array concat behavior

[19:25:21.0576] <keith_miller>
I thought isConcatSpreadable existed to make me suffer as a new hire :P

[19:25:26.0473] <ljharb>
iow that symbol is not relevant to this proposal.

[19:25:33.0673] <ljharb>
 * iow that symbol is not relevant to this proposal, whether it autowraps or not

[19:25:33.0795] <rbuckton>
It also likely wouldn't have been necessary if Array.prototype.concat did not have the auto-wrapping behavior

[19:25:38.0117] <ljharb>
that too!

[19:25:49.0124] <ljharb>
someone made sure that "make keith suffer" was redacted from the notes

[19:25:59.0579] <ljharb>
it would still have been necessary.

[19:26:07.0371] <ljharb>
because NodeLists aren't arrays and did have special concat behavior

[19:26:24.0609] <ljharb>
without the autowrapping, NodeLists would have thrown instead of spread

[19:26:42.0797] <ljharb>
 * without the autowrapping, NodeLists would have thrown instead of been added without spreading

[19:26:47.0235] <rbuckton>
Either way, auto-wrapping is a footgun. it also doesn't align with our recent decision to cut back on coercing things

[19:26:50.0862] <ljharb>
but NodeLists spread, thus the symbol. nothing to do with autowrapping whatsoever.

[19:27:27.0155] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
What's the special behavior of NodeList?

[19:29:21.0206] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> Either way, auto-wrapping is a footgun. it also doesn't align with our recent decision to cut back on coercing things

I guess the behavior of Array.p.concat is come from perl. Though perl have the sigil to indicate whether it's a scalar or list.

[19:32:15.0618] <nicolo-ribaudo>
As a committee, we should adopt the principle of "making it hard to accidentally do the wrong thing". When user intention is ambiguous, let's ask users to be explicit 

[19:33:35.0997] <littledan>
In TC39, the bare minimum is "web compatibility", which is a much weaker property than "breaking change". As Jordan explained, basically anything that we do can be considered breaking.

[19:36:58.0384] <Bradford Smith>
Iterable helpers that flatten their arguments are implicitly branching on iterability and likely to be used a lot in future.

[19:38:54.0648] <bakkot>
which iterable helpers flatten their arguments?

[19:39:22.0399] <Bradford Smith>
Maybe my memory is faulty. I thought there was at least one API that did this.

[19:39:29.0177] <rbuckton>
IIRC, `Iterator.prototype.flatMap` does not coerce non-iterator/non-iterable

[19:39:48.0947] <bakkot>
it rejects non-iterators

[19:40:42.0093] <rbuckton>
If you consider `Iterator.concat` to essentially be `(...args) => args.values().flatMap(x => x)`, then we should also throw for non-iterators

[19:41:00.0413] <ljharb>
in general as well, something being iterable is a massively impactful "trait" of it - something changing from being "a thing" to being "a container of things" isn't and shouldn't be a common thing. if we're talking about good API design, good API design wouldn't make this change, i'd think

[19:41:08.0775] <ljharb>

> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> If you consider `Iterator.concat` to essentially be `(...args) => args.values().flatMap(x => x)`, then we should also throw for non-iterators

to be really explicit, this proposal only accepts _iterables_, not iterators

[19:42:24.0171] <bakkot>
accepting _iterators_ turns out to get really awkward

[19:42:32.0129] <bakkot>
because you have to take responsibility for closing them

[19:44:31.0666] <rbuckton>
I'm not saying it must be implemented as such, but a naive implementation using `flatMap` would throw, not coerce.

[19:45:08.0919] <ljharb>
that naive implementation would eagerly exhaust the iterators, which this doesn't do

@ljharb:matrix.org very weakly yes, but I got over it quickly in Rust

[19:47:21.0900] <Justin Ridgewell>
Used a whole bunch of `once(foo)`, but it’s much easier in JS because you can wrap in an array without screwing with types.

[19:47:24.0273] <rbuckton>
For instance, iterator helper methods don't take a `thisArg` despite the array prototype methods of the same name doing so.

erights: As stated on a previous slide, there is no return override capability.

[21:33:35.0054] <Mathieu Hofman>
rbuckton: I think Mark's question (who isn't on Matrix) is whether a class can use a struct as the returned object in a return override to stamp fields on the struct

[21:33:50.0500] <rbuckton>
Ah. No, it cannot

[21:33:53.0958] <ljharb>
why not?

[21:33:58.0712] <ljharb>
if it's an object it should work

[21:34:08.0653] <ljharb>
just as if i can weakly hold it

[21:34:11.0135] <Mathieu Hofman>
I mean I'd love that, but yes, why, what's the mechanism ?

[21:34:30.0554] <ljharb>
it's an object. all objects (except `window`) can have fields stamped on them via return override.

[21:34:31.0373] <rbuckton>
No, the fields must be statically known at construction time for one-shot initialization

[21:34:49.0349] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> if it's an object it should work

I am very against this line of logic. A WeakMap capability should not be syntactic

[21:34:59.0328] <ljharb>
"adding a private field" is the same as "putting an object in a weakmap"

[21:35:04.0814] <ljharb>
that's explicitly how private fields were designed

[21:35:14.0752] <ljharb>
return override isn't syntactic

[21:35:49.0701] <ljharb>
it is currently an invariant that if it is an object (modulo window) you can stamp private fields onto it via return override. we shouldn't break that invariant.

[21:35:56.0604] <Mathieu Hofman>
return override + private field stamping is a syntactic capability that is not deniable or virtualizable, unlike WeakMap

[21:35:58.0027] <ljharb>
 * it is currently an invariant that if it is an object (modulo window) you can stamp private fields onto it via return override, and hold it weakly. we shouldn't break that invariant.

[21:36:10.0205] <ljharb>
that's already the case for all objects, it's a consequence of being an object.

[21:36:19.0551] <rbuckton>
private fields, if/when supported, will also have a fixed layout.

[21:36:21.0975] <Mathieu Hofman>
and it was a huge mistake

[21:36:30.0905] <Mathieu Hofman>
and I strongly believe we should not hold this as an invariant

[21:36:33.0018] <ljharb>
doesn't mean we should create inconsistency by deviating from it

[21:36:44.0329] <rbuckton>
it is necessary to achieve the performance characteristics we want for structs/shared structs

[21:36:50.0294] <ljharb>
to me this is an obstacle to stage 2, to be clear.

[21:37:09.0342] <bakkot>
can you `class extends Struct {}`? if so you can surely put a private filed in that class?

[21:37:13.0629] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> private fields, if/when supported, will also have a fixed layout.

The fixed layout is so that struct methods can "quickly" access them, right? Those installed via return override would not be private fields that belong to the struct, so they wouldn't go through that fast path

[21:39:44.0433] <rbuckton>
Yes and no. The fixed layout is partially so that implementations can properly optimize field accesses in ways that they cannot with normal fields today. For shared structs, we want private fields to be shared memory as well

[21:39:52.0464] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> can you `class extends Struct {}`? if so you can surely put a private filed in that class?

That is technically not necessary for for stamping private field

[21:40:08.0158] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> can you `class extends Struct {}`? if so you can surely put a private filed in that class?

 * That is technically not necessary for for stamping private fields

[21:40:43.0363] <bakkot>
right but... can you do that thing?

[21:45:55.0171] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> can you `class extends Struct {}`? if so you can surely put a private filed in that class?

We could possibly allow this by storing the private fields of a struct/shared struct differently than those added by a class, where private fields added by a class are more weakmap like, while those added by a shared struct maintain fixed layout to be portable across agents.

[21:46:39.0867] <ljharb>
that sounds like the only option to resolve it tbh

[21:46:45.0060] <bakkot>
I am OK with it being impossible to `class extends Struct {}`, to be clear

[21:46:51.0233] <bakkot>
just asking if that would work

[21:47:06.0773] <ljharb>
i'm not ok with being unable to stamp fields onto it.

[21:47:29.0357] <rbuckton>
I'd be fine `class extends struct` not working

[21:47:45.0753] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
As the current proposal, struct seems like a weakened version of class. Perceptually, the difference between struct and class is much smaller than the difference between struct and shared struct. I mean, it seems easy to rewrite a class to struct, but very hard to modify a struct to become a shared struct. This make me feel weird that "struct" and "shared struct" use similar name and syntax...

[21:48:37.0707] <bakkot>
if (and only if) it is impossible to `class extends Struct {}` then I am also ok with the return-override trick not allowing you to return a struct

[21:48:49.0891] <bakkot>
in which case, as a consequence, you could not stamp additional private fields on an existing struct

[21:49:17.0450] <littledan>
Correlation is also important even if you just have one object, and want the methods to work after sharing it to the other side

[21:51:06.0851] <rbuckton>
`struct` is a restricted form of `class`, partly because `class` polymorphism is expensive and slow and cannot be fully optimized via ICs. the fixed layout of structs is partly intended to improve performance due to the well known layout. Basically: `class` is more flexible but slower, `struct` is more restrictive but faster.

[21:55:12.0838] <rbuckton>

Function coloring is a function being aware of whether it is invoked inside of an `unsafe` block. 

[21:55:16.0574] <rkirsling>

[21:56:10.0041] <danielrosenwasser>

as a property access on a proxy, maybe, depending on the open question

[21:57:42.0973] <Mathieu Hofman>
but as a predicate that has the shape of a function, no

[21:57:58.0469] <ljharb>

You can try/catch around reading from a shared struct that you have, right?

```js
shared struct Test { x }

{
  try { new Test().x } catch { console.log("not unsafe block") }
}

unsafe {
  try { new Test().x; console.log("unsafe block") } catch { }
}
```

[22:00:01.0225] <rbuckton>
> <@haxjs:matrix.org> I understand from the engine viewpoint (or spec viewpoint) it's true, but I guess from developer concept model, it's too different.

Even from a developer point of view, the construction semantics of a `struct` differ enough from `class` that making it differ purely based on a modifier would trip up developers.

ok, but can i run that try/catch inside a function that someone else invokes in, or not in, an unsafe block?

[22:00:29.0272] <danielrosenwasser>

function foo() {
    unsafe {
        bar();
    }
}

function bar(sharedInstance) {

`bar` does not magically get colored as `unsafe` when called. it must be lexically scoped within the block.

 * I would like to see a lot more examples what code is/is not legal for `unsafe`, somewhere

[22:01:26.0602] <bakkot>
`unsafe`, sorry

[22:02:01.0549] <rbuckton>
`unsafe` only controls the ability to get/set a field on a shared struct instance, and only applies to code lexically scoped within the `unsafe {}` block.

[22:02:30.0989] <bakkot>
ok, that sounds straightforward; I think I got confused by all the discussion of coloring

[22:02:31.0568] <Mathieu Hofman>
`unsafe` only changes the behavior of get/set lexically contained in the block.

[22:02:43.0990] <bakkot>
but I am confused about the discussion of the APIs, then

[22:02:50.0764] <bakkot>
like `Reflect.get` etc

[22:03:20.0858] <Mathieu Hofman>
Should `Reflect.get` have some way to access the value (regardless of where the call happens)

[22:03:26.0756] <rbuckton>
The problem with `Reflect.get` is that it either must always succeed or always throw when reading a shared struct field.

[22:03:59.0156] <bakkot>
or we thread a parameter about unsafe-ness through, per the slides

[22:04:05.0247] <rbuckton>
Which means a Proxy must also either always succeed or always fail, or passing a get through a proxy trap becomes inconsistent when it passes through Reflect.get.

[22:04:10.0747] <rbuckton>
Yes, that's the third option.

[22:04:54.0371] <Mathieu Hofman>
get/set behavior is pretty straightforward. Where it gets funky is with own prop MOPs

[22:05:22.0334] <rbuckton>
My point is more that Reflect.get cannot magically know its in an `unsafe` block

[22:05:36.0186] <bakkot>
ack

[22:06:09.0943] <rbuckton>
It either must always succeed, always fail, or be explicitly informed via a parameter.

[22:11:35.0200] <danielrosenwasser>
Maybe I'm misunderstanding - but if you view it as an object which has been sealed, the behavior seems consistent with other objects, right?

[22:12:08.0700] <bakkot>
given a choice between "make it practical to write shared-memory parallelism in JS" and "preserve the property about things being in WeakMaps", I cannot _imagine_ thinking the second thing is as important

[22:12:17.0036] <bakkot>
it is like, several orders of magnitude less important

[22:16:30.0529] <bakkot>
this is not to say that I don't see the real cost to having more complex rules for developers. it's just that making it practical for pages to have shared-memory parallelism is of incredible, massive value to every user of the web, measured in nontrivial fractions of our lives spent waiting for slow pages that didn't have to be slow. and against that, "JS developers have more complexity to learn" just does not rate

[22:16:47.0977] <bakkot>
ideally, of course, we would find something that allows us to get both

[22:16:58.0990] <littledan>
Yeah this seems like a clear case of what Yulia mentioned as a philosophical concern 

[22:17:06.0547] <bakkot>
but if it comes down to a choice between those two, we cannot choose the "we don't get practical parallelism" one.

[22:17:52.0577] <rbuckton>
I'd much rather have shared memory multithreading than consistency with WeakMap keys. We already have this violation with symbols.

[22:20:35.0078] <rbuckton>
There is also the possibility that structs and shared structs are more primitive-like than object-like, especially given that shared struct per-realm prototype lookup is likely to be very much like primitive prototype lookup.

In a way, they are essentially "structured primitives" in that they have own fields. I'm not opposed to them having primitive-like behavior for `typeof` and `Object()`, but we'd need to discuss more among the champions.

right and we only considered it because R/T are immutable

[22:23:51.0803] <bakkot>
the value of `unsafe` blocks is definitely much lessened if `unsafe`-ness is not part of the type system. we could make it so, though? in the sense of, functions could be tagged with `unsafe`-ness, which is on by default if you use `unsafe {}` blocks, and then have some explicit mechanism for saying "this function uses an `unsafe` block but is actually safe"

[22:24:09.0611] <bakkot>
and if you call an `unsafe` function and do not have `unsafe {}` in your call stack then it throws

[22:24:21.0231] <bakkot>
disclaimer, I have not thought about this idea for more than 30 seconds

[22:25:03.0790] <rkirsling>
one concern that immediately rises in my mind (thinking about the cross-language notion of `unsafe`) is:

re: "unsafe"

[22:25:52.0701] <bakkot>
the reason `async` is annoying is because you can't go from async to sync

[22:26:04.0576] <rbuckton>
`unsafe {}` isn't necessary at all for shared memory semantics, it is purely a guardrail to discourage unintended misuse

[22:27:02.0705] <bakkot>
function coloring is annoying only because you can't use async from sync. here you could as long as you explicitly opt in to enforcing the invariants yourself.

Yes, `volatile {}` was a suggestion from the TypeScript team as an alternative, and we're welcome to discussing others if there is a better option.

[22:27:24.0823] <Bradford Smith>
Personal take: The benefit of private fields is guaranteed encapsulation. I see the reverse WeakMap used to implement it to be an unfortunate implementation detail, not something to take advantage of. I would expect and hope that 99% of developers will not even be aware of it. Given that, it would be really weird if you could add private fields to structs after construction - which are supposed to be of a fixed shape.

[22:27:47.0537] <Mathieu Hofman>
You also basically end up with a 1 bit dynamic scoping for unsafeness of the call

[22:30:26.0218] <rbuckton>
ljharb: (a) is mostly figured out amongst the stakeholders, and we believe (b), (c), and (d) will not significantly impact whether this proposal will advance beyond stage 2. (b) could obviously have some limitations in the long term.

What does "contamination" mean in this case? Isn't it solved by "no function coloring"?

[22:31:27.0977] <rbuckton>

`unsafe` is very local, it doesn't spread virally like `async`/`await`.

[22:31:58.0675] <Justin Ridgewell>
Does it need to be unsafe blocks?

[22:32:28.0916] <Justin Ridgewell>
Could it be `Reflect.getUnsafe()` and have it be explicit accesses without carrying a bit throughout the spec and ecosystem

[22:32:40.0639] <danielrosenwasser>
Is `accessor` allowed in a `shared struct`? Can I just avoid `unsafe` with that?

[22:33:15.0767] <rbuckton>

In the stakeholders call we have discussed deniability in the environment just being that you can't actually share the value across agents.

I don’t really wanna write `unsafe {}` everywhere either

[22:39:11.0435] <bakkot>
or just like when a `shared struct` is evaluated it checks `globalThis.canMakeSharedStructs` and then if you want to turn that off you make that nonwritable-nonconfigurable `false`

[22:39:12.0824] <rbuckton>

Neither do I, but its far more convenient than `Reflect.getUnsafe()`.

I did propose this, but not like async/await, more as a way to avoid doubly nested blocks. Alternatively, `function foo() unsafe {}`

[22:40:54.0081] <rbuckton>
Keep in mind that unlike async/await, `unsafe` does not spread virally to your callers

[22:41:08.0760] <ljharb>
i mean, async/await doesn't directly do that either

[22:41:13.0192] <ljharb>
only indirectly by returning a promise

[22:41:21.0144] <yulia>
async/await results in very viscous refactoring situations

[22:41:28.0440] <littledan>
I think it’s good that our process allows significant questions to be open during Stage 2. It would be bad if champions were incentivized to hide debates until later. But more importantly, the signal to invest significantly in a proposal is important to be able to dedicate the work to solve the problem.

[22:41:34.0147] <rbuckton>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> i mean, async/await doesn't directly do that either

In any meaningful way, it does. 

[22:41:35.0746] <yulia>
you have to update all callers, or end up with a fire and forget situation

> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> I did propose this, but not like async/await, more as a way to avoid doubly nested blocks. Alternatively, `function foo() unsafe {}`

Is @waldemarh:matrix.org's concern that `unsafe` exists as a concept, or that it’s implemented as a block?

[22:41:45.0359] <yulia>
so yeah unsafe would not be that viscuous

[22:41:55.0424] <Justin Ridgewell>
If the second, than unsafe functions don’t really solve it.

[22:42:06.0937] <waldemar>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> I don't understand what "contamination" means here

`unsafe` will contaminate generic abstractions and algorithms, which will be pressured to wrap themselves inside `unsafe` blocks just so that folks can pass shared structs into them. Most don't really care about consistency and we already have the same problem with accessors, callbacs, and proxies. Wrapping one of these in `unsafe` will just become boilerplate practice.

[22:42:41.0192] <yulia>
the function solution would be implemented the same way as the block, and would have the same complexity concern i had earlier, which is why i wasn't so serious with it

[22:43:07.0700] <yulia>
so its not really a solution, we would need something else, that doesn't require marking the get/set with a flag

shared memory multithreading is more of a power-user feature, I doubt every npm package is going to start enclosing their sources in `unsafe {}` at the top level as a workaround. That's just bad practice.

But generic abstractions and algorithms shouldn't be unsafely dealing with shared structs, that's the point. They are likely not able to operate generically on the object.

How do you tell an abstraction that can apply to both shared and unshared structs that this usage is safe and that usage is unsafe?

[22:48:41.0113] <Mathieu Hofman>
To be honest the only thing I can think of (besides unsafe blocks) to enable correct shared fields access is to only allow private shared fields, which would require methods / accessors

[22:49:06.0919] <ljharb>
that would give you immutable structs right out of the gate, no?

Many, if not most, can and should. Almost the same problem already arises with getters, setters, proxies, callbacks mutating state, etc.

[22:49:52.0730] <rbuckton>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> that would give you immutable structs right out of the gate, no?

"immutable" if you squint hard. 

[22:49:57.0631] <shu>
reading the back log, i agree with Mathieu Hofman that return override w/ private field stamping really really should not rise to the level of a design invariant that consciously aim to keep

[22:50:15.0668] <ljharb>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> "immutable" if you squint hard.

lol i mean, a shared struct with no setters, then, would be immutable from without at least?

[22:50:41.0005] <rbuckton>
Yes, I picked up on that.

[22:50:56.0446] <waldemar>
In practice there is very little delta between the mischief shared objects can get into and what ordinary callbacks, accessors, proxies, etc. can do.

[22:51:22.0078] <waldemar>
The differences are primarily of interest to experts, not causal users.

i agree, but i also don't know how to address mark's requirement that the app-wide opt-in/out switch like COOP/COEP is insufficient

They do. Unsafe blocks won't fix that.

[22:52:49.0606] <rbuckton>
I'd rather not have `unsafe {}`, to be honest. But I'd rather have `unsafe {}` if that means we can get usable shared memory multithreading. I'm open to other suggestions so long as they don't negatively impact performance in a meaningful way.

[22:53:17.0219] <shu>
though i don't think we've fully engaged with bakkot's idea that there _be_ a programmatic way to deny shared structs, even if they're syntax?

Given that JS has proxies and getters, any property access could conceivably change underneath you.

[22:56:17.0474] <shu>

[22:56:45.0511] <shu>
wtf is wrong with matrix

[22:56:48.0093] <rbuckton>
Also, its possible to write abstractions that work with shared and unshared objects equally, so long as they do so through callbacks since those callbacks can be lexically scoped within an `unsafe {}` block.

That's part of it. A bigger part is that:
- unsafe blocks will contaminate generic code merely because someone wants to use it with shared structs
- we don't have a story for how to indicate which user API calls are safe and which are unsafe, so it's a false guardrail.

How does `unsafe` work in Rust? I know that it's a different type of unsafe, but I assume some of the same concerns about "virality" and "false guardrail" still apply?

[23:06:58.0176] <rbuckton>
Rust has a borrow checker and full type system, so it can enforce the guardrail via the API

[23:07:29.0180] <rbuckton>
In JS, we have "call your function `fooUnsafe()`"

[23:07:36.0014] <rbuckton>
 * In JS, we have "name your function `fooUnsafe()`"

[23:07:47.0357] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Re the "everybody would use unsafe just to be sure", maybe instead of `unsafe` we can use a different property access operator. e.g. `obj.foo` only works for non-shared objects, and `obj⚠️.foo` would only work fore shared structs

[23:08:11.0793] <nicolo-ribaudo>
So you cannot use it "just in case", and if you want to write code that works with both you have to introduce your own abstractions

So my understanding is that basically expressions allowed in an unsafe context are:

> - Call an unsafe function or method

The other two are basically markers at the declaration site, and they push the work onto the caller to either contain the code in an `unsafe` block, or mark the containing function as unsafe. Because you have both options, function coloring isn't mandatory.

[23:13:24.0189] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It sounds much more similar to the one proposed for shared structs than I expected! "Access fields of a union" is kinda like our use case, even if it's unsafe for different reasons

[23:13:57.0619] <nicolo-ribaudo>
But the difference is that whether you need unsafe or not is not determined by your caller, because as Ron said there is a type checker

[23:30:12.0331] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Isn't it something that can be implemented just in the bytecode emitter, relying on existing ops?

[23:30:13.0393] <rkirsling>
I looked that one up too because it blew my mind

[23:30:23.0853] <Michael Ficarra>
I want to know what portion of these CVEs would have been impossible had they been implemented in a memory safe language

[23:30:25.0326] <rkirsling>
it was specific to SM's initial implementation 

[23:30:56.0272] <ljharb>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> I want to know what portion of these CVEs would have been impossible had they been implemented in a memory safe language

esp given the v8 team's pushback to openssf on switching to one

[23:31:31.0233] <Michael Ficarra>
Obviously "more C++ code" means "more memory bugs". That does not mean we should do less language development. It means that we should write less C++ code.

[23:31:35.0773] <yulia>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> I want to know what portion of these CVEs would have been impossible had they been implemented in a memory safe language

We tried implementing the parser in rust, but ran into performance issues

[23:32:12.0452] <yulia>
rust isn't as heavily optimized yet, and also certain areas of the engine such as garbage collection don't really work in rust

[23:32:13.0904] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Maybe we could just write engines in JS and compile them to native with Porffor

[23:32:17.0322] <Michael Ficarra>
oh I didn't realise performance was more important than security

[23:32:36.0438] <yulia>
if it wasn't a balance, we would not have jits.

[23:35:02.0676] <yulia>
we are trying to approach this in an open way, so that we can come to a solution together. The vast majority of monetary investment, in making JS work, is on implementers shoulders. Being told to stop complaining and that our concerns are invalid is not a way forward. We, as equal delegates, can just say no to all features going forward. We aren't doing that, instead we are inviting dialogue.

also, JSSugar is one solution, coming from v8 -- not all of the vendors are aligned on it

browser vendors aren't the only implementers

[23:37:45.0685] <yulia>
I didn't speak of browsers, but implementers. Moddable is a cosigner

[23:38:16.0114] <Michael Ficarra>
And I'm also really bitter that browsers (and OS vendors) continue to write more code in a memory-unsafe language that I have to run on my computer.

[23:39:15.0096] <yulia>
well, if we make some really radical moves maybe we can make it more feasible to do 1) more of the language in memory safe languages regardless of the browser engine, and 2) allow more competitors 

[23:39:33.0436] <yulia>
let's talk about it after because its a big idea that won't be discussed now (im still talking to stakeholders about it)

Okay, I meant vendors, not specifically browser vendors. Igalia is an implementer who works on engines built by other vendors. Although we're probably in a unique position

[23:40:30.0973] <yulia>
some parts, at least at present (GC in particular) aren't feasible in a safe language, just because of what you are doing

Michael Ficarra: the most chrome / v8 bugs are not because our C++ is doing memory management wrong, they are because we have a logic bug in generating machine code or because our invariants are extremely complex and one part might make a change which violates an invariant somewhere else. happy to talk more about this. interestingly, a huge proportion of the CVEs listed on shu's slide were in my code, and none of my bugs were because of C++, and would've happened even if V8 was written in a memory safe language.

I'm unhappy about the framing of this as a tension between users, developers, and implementors. In most cases we can reduce complexity for all three; existing complexity is a result of past decisions that benefited none of these three.

[00:15:49.0081] <Chris de Almeida>
I'm trying to keep an open mind, but at the end of the day this forks the language and I would just not use the sugar features.  yes people use tooling but not exclusively all the time, and a lot of workflows rely on the language being available directly in the browser

On the other hand, something like nullish coallescing resulted in _more efficient_ code in the end, but (for firefox) we had users who suffered from stability

this is because syntax in particular is not forward compatible. you can't shim it, you have to transpile it.

A lot of folks are making points about low BigInt usage, but we'd be hurting if something like that weren't in the language — it comes up rarely in APIs, but, when it does come up, hacking around the lack of BigInt would have made a bigger mess.

Right, it's a coordination point, and the language is the responsible party for providing those.

[00:19:28.0361] <rbuckton>
```js
x = a |> b(%) |> %.c()

```js
var _;
x = (_ = a, _ = b(_), _.c());

How is this relevant? Those websites would have broken even if there was a missing runtime API. The developer would have still chosen to ship the polyfill for that browser version, similarly to how they could have shipped with the transpiled code

imo the reason bigint didn't get adoption is because it's not smoothly interoperable with Number, and thus only devs with bigint-specific use cases use bigints. which isn't many.

[00:28:15.0485] <Michael Ficarra>
I don't really care either way about regexp. Don't use eval or Function.

[00:28:47.0431] <rbuckton>
And the `eval` case was an important discussion point re: decorators raised by Mark Miller, so it's come up before in plenary.

[00:28:56.0798] <canadahonk>

> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> I don't have data to support this, but I really think the presentation overestimates the use of build/compilation tooling, and disregards the abundance of... not using those things, or in the same way

The nuance that I feel like I've never managed to successfully communicate is that tooling is a spectrum but we usually frame it as a dichotomy.  Even folk that can't go tool-free benefit from tool-lite.  It's also about the % of scenarios that benefit from a % of features working tool-free.

[00:31:17.0139] <rbuckton>
> <@canadahonk:matrix.org> `...` and `eval(...)` differing completely in support feels 🥴

You can sort of make it work, but it requires knowing the intricacies of the language. e.g., transpiling
```js
@decorator
class C {
}
```
and expecting `eval(C.toString())` to produce the same result won't work, but
```js
function f() {
  @decorator
  class C {
  }
  return C;
}
```
and `eval(f.toString())()` would purely because the function body would capture the entire transpiled result. It's a mess, so definitely not recommended.

Node.js shipping a TS compiler is the proof that people hate using tooling

[00:33:19.0540] <Chengzhong Wu>

[00:35:38.0476] <rbuckton>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> Node.js shipping a TS compiler is the proof that people hate using tooling

NodeJS would also like other TS features to come to JS so transpiling is less necessary (`enum`, parameter properties, etc.)

Yulia: Wasm is in scope for source maps. Considering other serializations is as well, though the group has decided so far that this type of efficiency isn’t the most pressing concern.

[00:38:14.0719] <yulia>
Source maps is just too heavy. it doesn't scale. WASM was using dwarf but there were issues with that as well (i believe for supporting all languages)

[00:38:32.0847] <Rob Palmer>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> Node.js shipping a TS compiler is the proof that people hate using tooling

I would use a weaker word than "hate".

It's more about the hierarchy of abstractions - ideas > design patterns > tools > runtimes > language.  The more fundamental/essential the functionality, the more folk benefit from pushing it down the hierarchy to codify it and make it more accessible.  Folk like types being even more accessible.

[00:38:41.0067] <yulia>
I think that the current source maps group doesn't have any overlap with the WASM debugging wg, but the issue of debugging information in JS was part of that as well

[00:39:33.0009] <littledan>
We are definitely focusing on the mapping to Wasm from source maps. Are there any participants from the previous effort that we should recruit to join?

[00:39:57.0995] <yulia>
have you had fitzgen come by at all?

[00:40:16.0605] <yulia>
I don't know if he will have time but he was on both

[00:41:28.0368] <rbuckton>
Many if not most syntax proposals will require runtime functionality to work. `using` requires `Symbol.dispose`, pattern matching requires `Symbol.customMatcher` as methods on a number of built-ins, so a single feature requires changes to both JS0 and JSSugar.

[00:44:23.0824] <jkup>
> <@yulia:mozilla.org> have you had fitzgen come by at all?

Nope, not to any of our recent meetings at least! Would love it if he had time. For WASM the effort has mostly been lead by Kotlin, Chrome DevTools and Tauri so far.

Why couldn't `using` be desuggared? `Symbol.dispose ??= Symbol{)` would be the init sequence for the shared symbol

[00:45:30.0523] <yulia>
So if you didn't have the history: we tried to standardize source maps before. That is what became the wasm debugging group

[00:46:05.0829] <rbuckton>
That's not the same as a built-in symbol, plus the `using` proposal has other API changes as well.

> <@mhofman:matrix.org> maybe it's not seen in the instrumentation of browsers, but there are a lot of backend use cases for BigInt

Is there bigint instrumentation in browsers? I looked on chromestatus.com/metrics earlier and it doesn't seem to have any related counters

[01:04:01.0039] <rbuckton>
Is bit math still slower on BigInt compared Number? I've wanted to switch to bigint for some of our flags in the TS compiler, but we only recently changed our minimum target to one that supports bigint natively.

[01:08:39.0282] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> Tooling can't address `eval`, `new Function`, other evaluators, or `new RegExp()` which would need the tooling to be run _in browser_ to support these transformations.

That was a point I wanted to raise on the queue. That or somehow admit that any dynamically evaluated code will have to be compiled ahead of time.

[01:09:31.0541] <Chris de Almeida>
shu: yulia I captured the queue for JSSugar.  do you want a continuation if we have time later?

[01:09:50.0809] <yulia>
I've already spoken with them, they are fine with it. But due to issues brought up from other parts of the web platform, regarding what TG2 has been standardizing, we are under heavier scrutiny. So, i'm just double checking with our internal stake holders.

[01:11:16.0663] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> I don't really care either way about regexp. Don't use eval or Function.

eval is not evil. there are ways to safely evaluate untrusted code.

I get excited whenever I see well organized data

[01:14:47.0147] <Ashley Claymore>
Maybe that proposal would have been split in two in the same way? Browsers initially only implement the Symbol and add implementations of the methods to the right web APIs. But the syntax part stays at JSSugar (at least initially)

[01:15:20.0593] <Ashley Claymore>
And then in the future Browsers implement the syntax part too when it's the right time for that to happen

[01:26:43.0180] <Mathieu Hofman>
Yes and no. For example Cloudflare Workers pretend time only advances when making external requests. The time is updated to the time the request is processed.

[01:28:36.0301] <Mathieu Hofman>
From what I understand they have some smart logic when you make a request from one worker to another to avoid colluding workers measuring time

[01:28:38.0548] <justingrant>
I had the same question/concern: other than purely "sugar" features like pipeline, most interesting new JS features seem like they'd need some help from the lower-level runtime to have adequate performance and functionality.

It'd be good to have some case studies of a few proposals to see what a JSSugar implementation would actually look like in practice.

Fun co-incidence. The 'toSorted' spec bug was caught by a Japanese developer

[18:41:35.0359] <Jack Works>
"Summing a list is a very common operation and is one of the few remaining use cases for Array.prototype.reduce."

[18:41:46.0660] <Jack Works>
are we going to discouraging use of [].reduce?

[18:43:01.0545] <rkirsling>
no, because you don't necessarily want the new behavior

[18:43:22.0117] <jkup>
The reduce will be faster still, right?

[18:44:10.0006] <Michael Ficarra>
@jkup:matrix.org an equivalent loop will, at least

[18:44:19.0156] <Michael Ficarra>
but you REALLY don't want to do that

[18:44:41.0910] <Michael Ficarra>
your result can accumulate a ton of error

[18:44:43.0897] <Jack Works>
the wording sounds like reduce is a bad thing (actually yes in most cases it _reduce_ the code readability)

[18:45:48.0139] <Jack Works>
but I'm not expecting that we should have a proposal to solve "the few remaining use cases of reduce", other motivations are ok thou

[18:46:27.0840] <rkirsling>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> but you REALLY don't want to do that

I mean, in a specific case you might know that you're just adding e.g. a couple dozen single-digit ints or something though

[18:46:42.0829] <rkirsling>
just depends on the guarantees you're working with

[18:47:07.0181] <shu>
did you know reduce is pronounced re-doo-che

[18:47:27.0354] <Michael Ficarra>
@rkirsling:matrix.org if the number of values you're summing is small enough, the difference in perf between compensated and uncompensated is negligible anyway

[18:47:38.0628] <rkirsling>
touché!

[18:47:57.0336] <Michael Ficarra>
and once it gets large enough to care about perf, you should also care about error accumulation

[18:47:59.0652] <Jack Works>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> did you know reduce is pronounced re-doo-che

not re-diu-s, or it's a ghoti joke?

[18:48:49.0009] <rkirsling>
it is neither, it's just a "let's pronounce this word in a silly way" joke

[18:49:32.0084] <rkirsling>
...the silly way in this case being like Italian, presumably :D

[18:53:36.0241] <Chris de Almeida>

[18:54:49.0766] <bakkot>
> <@jkup:matrix.org> The reduce will be faster still, right?

I would guess this will actually be faster because the reduce has to do callbacks. at least in the case where the engine knows it's a list of numbers already, `sumPrecise` can avoid a lot of work, which may make up for the difference

[18:58:01.0480] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
I feel `setdefault` is ok. Not sure why people prefer callback...

[18:58:15.0771] <ljharb>
because sometimes the default is expensive to compute.

[18:58:18.0901] <Michael Ficarra>
the callback can be lifted outside a loop, I'm not too worried about it

[18:58:19.0174] <Jack Works>
`getOrSet`

[18:58:55.0236] <bakkot>
it's true that people _can_ avoid re-creating the callback, but they're not going to

[18:58:59.0587] <shu>
yeah

[18:59:00.0294] <ljharb>
i am also skeptical that prepending `() =>` would have a noticeable perf hit, but have no way to argue that

[18:59:14.0145] <bakkot>
allocating throwaway closures is a lot more expensive than `0`

[18:59:16.0914] <shu>
it will have a noticeable perf hit in a hot loop for sure?

[18:59:20.0233] <shu>
allocation + call

[18:59:34.0563] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> allocating throwaway closures is a lot more expensive than `0`

```
function returnZero() { return 0; }
```

[18:59:45.0730] <shu>
yeah people aren't gonna do that, i agree with kevin there

[18:59:48.0968] <shu>
people will write ()=>0

[18:59:53.0527] <bakkot>
100% of the time

[18:59:56.0937] <Michael Ficarra>
@shuyuguo:matrix.org @bakkot:matrix.org when it's `[]`, you're creating tons of thrown-away arrays instead of just not calling a callback

[19:00:08.0752] <shu>
when what is []?

[19:00:08.0878] <bakkot>
but at least you don't have to call anything

[19:00:19.0680] <ljharb>
in Iterator.concat the throwaway arrays were supposed to be nbd

[19:00:20.0117] <bakkot>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> when what is []?

when that's the default value

[19:00:24.0435] <Michael Ficarra>
people who care about perf already know to lift regexps outside of loops for example, this is the same thing

[19:00:27.0647] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> because sometimes the default is expensive to compute.

But current `map.set` has similar issue?

[19:00:29.0954] <shu>
if the default value is [], presumably you want a different empty array?

[19:00:55.0533] <ljharb>
> <@haxjs:matrix.org> But current `map.set` has similar issue?

currently you'd have to do your own has/get/set, and the set would be conditionally evaluated, so it'd always be the same as a callback (or better)

[19:01:01.0725] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> in Iterator.concat the throwaway arrays were supposed to be nbd

we're talking about vastly different numbers of throwaway arrays here

[19:01:07.0954] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> if the default value is [], presumably you want a different empty array?

map.setdefault(key, []) already give u a diff empty array?

[19:01:19.0518] <shu>
yes

[19:01:28.0161] <shu>
that's why i don't understand michael's point

[19:01:28.0726] <Eli Grey>
insert should be the value and use a getter for the function use case in emplace imo

[19:01:35.0897] <shu>
you _can't_ have a single [] be the default

[19:01:39.0783] <shu>
unless you have copy-on-write []

[19:01:59.0833] <Michael Ficarra>
@shuyuguo:matrix.org I'm talking about doing this operation in a loop

[19:02:14.0748] <shu>
how can you lift out a default [] out of a loop?

[19:02:25.0222] <shu>
you want all the default empty arrays to be the literal same array object, which can be mutated?

[19:02:35.0768] <Michael Ficarra>
@shuyuguo:matrix.org you can't, that's the point, you make it a callback and lift that out

[19:02:43.0875] <shu>
wat

[19:02:48.0806] <shu>
why would you make a callback at all

[19:02:55.0846] <shu>
setdefault(k, []) does the right thing?

[19:03:27.0696] <Michael Ficarra>
@shuyuguo:matrix.org it would be more performant

[19:03:34.0289] <shu>
_what_

[19:03:48.0999] <Jack Works>
(joke) I guess we have to materialize ParseNode.

```
.emplace(key, complexExpression)
function emplace(key, value) { if (!this.has(key)) this.set(key, eval value); return this.get(key) }
```

[19:03:52.0005] <shu>
are you saying doing a call on a const function that returns [] is faster than directly passing in []?

[19:03:55.0959] <Michael Ficarra>
a shared callback that is almost never called is more performant than tons of empty arrays that end up getting GC'd

[19:03:59.0080] <Jack Works>
* (joke) I guess we have to materialize ParseNode.

```
.emplace(key, complexExpression)
function emplace(key, value) {if (!this.has(key)) this.set(key, eval value); return this.get(key) }
```

[19:04:12.0345] <Jack Works>
* (joke) I guess we have to materialize ParseNode.

```js
.emplace(key, complexExpression)
function emplace(key, value) {
    if (!this.has(key)) this.set(key, eval value);
    return this.get(key)
}
```

[19:04:13.0505] <shu>
oh, i see, i missed the assumption that it's rarely a hit

[19:04:20.0704] <shu>
or, rarely a miss

[19:04:40.0852] <shu>
that depends on whether your loop mostly hits or mostly misses, right?

[19:04:47.0042] <ljharb>
that's the benefit of using a callback in the API as well; that the default fn would almost never be called, for when it's expensive

[19:04:51.0436] <Michael Ficarra>
correct @shuyuguo:matrix.org

[19:05:04.0947] <shu>
but a callback version would be more expensive when it is mostly misses

[19:05:09.0412] <shu>
so it 'just depends'

[19:05:09.0948] <Jack Works>
well, what react do is good, but bad

[19:05:22.0248] <Jack Works>
they call it when it is a function

[19:05:23.0218] <Anthony Bullard>
Is it not possible to do both? 

[19:05:29.0259] <Michael Ficarra>
@ljharb:matrix.org they're worried that people will write the callback inline so instead we'll be creating tons of fresh functions that need to get GC'd

[19:05:36.0503] <Jack Works>
> <@anthonybullard:matrix.org> Is it not possible to do both? 

like react do to `useState`

[19:05:44.0502] <bakkot>
both is good

[19:05:46.0722] <Jack Works>
most cases it's good, some cases it's footgun

[19:05:50.0612] <shu>

`getWhenHasOrSetFromCallbackAndFinallyGetAgain`

[19:07:37.0579] <Anthony Bullard>
I just meant the arg can be either a value or a function to return the value

[19:07:55.0870] <Anthony Bullard>
Obviously an issue if the value you want is a function

[19:08:01.0273] <Jack Works>
> <@anthonybullard:matrix.org> I just meant the arg can be either a value or a function to return the value

yes, react do this and sometimes it's a footgun

[19:08:09.0784] <bakkot>
oh, absolutely not that

[19:08:16.0249] <bakkot>
functions are valid values to store in a map

[19:08:19.0525] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>

[19:09:03.0492] <Anthony Bullard>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP DOING THIS TO THEMSELVES?!

Yeah I thought of this after the fact

[19:09:22.0423] <Jack Works>
when you're in react and `useState` value might be a function, you do `useState(() => fn)`

[19:09:55.0165] <Anthony Bullard>
But other languages aren’t afraid of having separate methods/functions for value args and function args

[19:10:14.0588] <Jack Works>
how do you like extractors

[19:10:20.0506] <bakkot>
> <@haxjs:matrix.org> java have both:`putIfAbsent` ( = python setdefault), `computeIfAbsent` is callback version.

I don't like `putIfAbsent` because it doesn't suggest that it gives you the current value in the case that it's present

`computeIfAbsent` doesn't really either but I guess it's more obviously going to return _something_ because "compute" suggests returning something

Likewise, I think it could be helpful to see concretely what the performance concerns are, why certain optimizations are difficult for engine implementers, etc.

[20:06:53.0117] <littledan>
Yeah this feature is as expensive as a method call + array destructuring; I understand the concern about array destructuring being expensive but I don’t know what else engines are imagining that tools would do

[20:07:38.0016] <littledan>
I dont think we should block all features where people have posited impractical optimizations. We certainly would not have done iterator helpers if that were a requirement

But I think there's a legitimate "pit of despair" concern. Like imagine you are writing a tool that you want to be reasonably fast and you posit that pattern matching should be as fast as a `switch` on the class or something like that

[20:20:53.0520] <keith_miller>
I think the concern here is that we're (potentially) offering a very clean but expensive abstraction/idiom that people are trained from other languages to be zero-cost.

[20:21:28.0833] <keith_miller>
If this idiom is no worse than what people would do otherwise then I'm not concerned

[20:21:42.0293] <keith_miller>
 * If this idiom is no worse in terms of performance than what people would do otherwise then I'm not concerned

[20:22:54.0500] <keith_miller>
But I think adding or encouraging idioms that have known to be bad performance isn't in browser user's interest and that's what I'm trying to reflect.

[20:23:07.0327] <rbuckton>
Summary has been added.

[20:24:17.0987] <rbuckton>
> <@keith_miller:matrix.org> If this idiom is no worse in terms of performance than what people would do otherwise then I'm not concerned

The expectation is that `const Point(x, y) = p` is no more expensive than `const [x, y] = Point[Symbol.customMatcher](p, "list")`

[20:25:06.0519] <rbuckton>
though if we end up not finding a solution to iterator destructuring performance and end up going with array-as-object destructuring, `const Point(x, y) = p` is potentially *faster*

[20:25:18.0170] <keith_miller>
But it might be more expensive than: `if (p instanceof Point) { let x = p.x; let y = p.y ...}`

[20:25:43.0403] <keith_miller>
So that's the bar to compare against

[20:27:10.0977] <keith_miller>
And devs just might structure their code differently without this, potentially in a way that's more performant. I'm saying that I want to be convinced they're not.

[20:27:21.0762] <rbuckton>
That doesn't have the expressivity we're seeking. The motivations include custom validation.

[20:27:54.0814] <rbuckton>
The `Point` example from my slides used brand checking via private names

[20:28:04.0314] <keith_miller>
That's a bummer and I would like to have that validation too but not really my concern, unfortunately.

[20:28:42.0322] <littledan>
I understand the performance concern “this will encourage people to use more array destructuring”. There are a number of possible remedies to that

[20:30:03.0567] <littledan>
One is using this alternative Array-like destructuring semantics, as Rob mentioned. If we want to avoid the allocation altogether, we could also limit extractors to a single argument, and then any nested array destructuring would be explicit.

[20:30:09.0623] <littledan>
* One is using this alternative Array-like destructuring semantics, as Ron mentioned. If we want to avoid the allocation altogether, we could also limit extractors to a single argument, and then any nested array destructuring would be explicit.

[20:30:34.0285] <keith_miller>
It's not just the array destructuring although that's part of the concern. It's if the idiom makes sense as a whole.

[20:30:49.0673] <littledan>
The discussion got a bit abstract as to which performance concerns people had. What other ones were there apart from array destructuring cost?

[20:31:34.0316] <littledan>
Or whether the idiom makes sense… it is really common across languages and I have found it useful, so I am wondering if people can make their concerns more concrete.

[20:32:02.0922] <keith_miller>
What other dynamic languages have this?

[20:32:15.0870] <littledan>
Pattern matching/extractors are definitely not linked to static typing. Python and Racket have versions 

[20:32:25.0863] <rbuckton>
Python, though they do something slightly different that the pattern matching champions group does not agree with.

[20:32:37.0590] <littledan>
It is just random cultural history that they are linked to functional/statically typed languages 

[20:33:03.0603] <littledan>
Erlang is dynamically typed and does tons of pattern matching

[20:33:38.0168] <littledan>
Prolog for that matter, untyped and the ancestor of a lot of these ideas 

[20:35:10.0853] <littledan>
Elixir https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/pattern-matching.html#the-match-operator

[20:35:31.0874] <keith_miller>
But are those idioms performant in those languages? Or are they just a cost people are willing to pay for convenience? 

[20:35:59.0657] <rbuckton>
Its not really a static vs dynamic language feature. C# uses `Deconstruct()` for custom extraction, and static type information to do overload disambiguation and argument matching, but compared to this the main difference is that C# uses `out` parameters, which we don't have, rather than something like iterator destructuring.

[20:37:03.0257] <keith_miller>
I'm not debating the convenience of the idiom. Only its potential performance impact with use.

[20:38:13.0570] <littledan>
I haven’t heard anyone talk about pattern matching as an expensive feature outside of the array destructuring issue in any other language. Some functional statically typed languages do fancy things optimizing trees of conditionals for pattern matching but others don’t.

[20:38:44.0218] <rbuckton>
The pattern matching proposal has some interesting mechanisms it plans to employ related to caching that have the side benefit of improving performance in a disjunction or multiple match-legs.

[20:39:17.0176] <keith_miller>
Then that should make proving it's performant easy!

[20:39:48.0784] <keith_miller>
I'm not saying it's not performant only that I'd like to see real world use cases benchmarked.

[20:39:50.0576] <rbuckton>
So in pattern matching something like :
```js
match (x) {
  Point(0, 0): ...,
  Point(>0, 0): ...,
}
```
could potentially only evaluates the custom matcher once and reuse the extracted elements on both match legs.

[20:40:02.0778] <rbuckton>

Yeah this is a reasonable and good request but to be able to do it, it would help to understand what people think could go wrong. Ron has posited some possible complex optimizations but those cases could be optimized or made slower with or without pattern matching.

[20:42:25.0413] <rbuckton>
Pattern matching caching is something I'm *not* looking forward to desugaring mostly due to the emit size of the desugaring. I'm hoping I can stash a lot of it in emit helpers in `tslib` to cut down on bundle size.

I guess this is something we will debate in the broader pattern matching proposal. I was hoping we wouldn’t do the kind of complex caching that some versions of pattern matching had—this might add more cost than value, given that it has to be deterministic and consistent

[20:44:43.0537] <littledan>
And the >0 syntax is a whole other topic!

[20:45:02.0158] <rbuckton>

If array destructuring is expensive and impractical to optimize, should we in TC39 be discouraging its use? For example, by encouraging transpilers to transform it into object destructuring (treating it as array-like)?

[20:51:18.0240] <littledan>
I don’t like this idea personally but if this is such a big problem that we can’t build other features on it…

[21:00:21.0643] <bakkot>
yes, code which cares about performance does specifically write `{ 0: foo, 1: bar }` instead of `[foo, bar]`

 * I do basically this internally (sorry spec)

[21:04:02.0649] <canadahonk>
it definitely fails some test262 tests though

[21:04:34.0336] <rbuckton>
How many people use `for..of` over arrays today? I assume that still isn't optimized for Array vs other iterators.

[21:05:34.0254] <bakkot>
I am almost certain that's optimized in JSC, at least

[21:05:49.0102] <bakkot>
and would kind of expect it to be in V8 but it's been a while since I looked

[21:05:57.0353] <shu>
we suck at it still i think

[21:06:22.0490] <rbuckton>
If you can optimize `for..of` why not `const [x, y]`?

[21:06:28.0896] <rbuckton>
 * If you can optimize `for..of` why not `const [x, y] =`?

[21:07:43.0894] <shu>
why can do _something_ for `const [x,y]` probably, but it's not going to be parity with object destructuring, will have a perf cliff for non-Arrays and a bunch of other bailout paths

there're a lot of undesirables hidden behind "why not optimize this other pattern"

[21:09:25.0863] <rbuckton>
I expect most destructuring is array to array, but I don't have metrics to back that up.

[21:09:54.0290] <rbuckton>
I'd be perfectly happy with Array being fast and other iterators being slower, since the alternative is both are slower.

[21:10:43.0238] <shu>
yeah i agree it's worth optimizing that?

[21:10:48.0839] <rbuckton>
React alone should be enough of a reason to optimize array to array destructuring, but I'm working on some benchmarking to get and understanding of the actual effect it has.

Yes they can—tsc does it in some emit modes unconditionally!

almost all of my code is `for..of` even it might be slow. readibility > performance when the code is not in a hot path

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hWb-lQW4NSG9yRpyyiAA_9Ktytd5lypLnVLhPX9vamE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9ss45aibqpw2

[21:12:16.0065] <rbuckton>
TSC only does that for `--target ES5` where there is no expectation of `Symbol.iterator`.

[21:12:37.0013] <littledan>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> sorry, without also breaking some other code

If you care about breaking other code, then you might need runtime support to check that no one messed with Array.prototype

[21:12:39.0579] <rbuckton>
And we have `--downevelIteration` to emulate actual ES2015+ semantics.

[21:13:03.0479] <littledan>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> transpilers can't do this without type information

 * Yes they can—tsc does it in some emit modes unconditionally! (When emitting es5)

[21:13:22.0545] <littledan>
Yes sorry that wasn’t meant as a tsc critique

[21:13:59.0873] <littledan>
But generally: if we want transpilers to do unsound things (like around TDZ) that is something we as a committee can say

[21:14:14.0651] <rbuckton>
Even in the `--downlevelIteration` case we use a runtime helper to emulate an iterator over an array, rather than bake that into the actual loop.

[21:14:30.0357] <rbuckton>
so the emit remains the same regardless as to the type of the iterated object

[21:14:41.0441] <shu>

oh cool. looks like we didn't actually land any of the talked about solutions though? the bytecode still looks pretty bad to me

[21:14:48.0418] <littledan>
I dunno if we should do such unsound downlevelings but I don’t know what else would actually meet what the browsers seem to be expecting

[21:14:59.0685] <shu>
the quickest way to make sure that happens is to make it show up in speedometer or the new jetstream

[21:15:12.0034] <Ashley Claymore>
is it a really bad idea to have a 3rd form of destructuring for array-like?

```
const |a, b, c| = multiReturnFunction(); // probably a better token is available
// is
const { 0: a, 1: b, 2: c } = multiReturnFunction();
```

[21:16:28.0025] <keith_miller>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> The expectation is that `const Point(x, y) = p` is no more expensive than `const [x, y] = Point[Symbol.customMatcher](p, "list")`

Sorry getting back to this but while yes `const Point(x, y) = p` isn't more expensive than that `const Optional.Some(Point.2D(x, y)) = o` would likely decode to 20-30 byte codes in JSC

[21:16:33.0353] <rbuckton>
`let |a, ` is ambiguous

[21:17:07.0352] <Ashley Claymore>
one R&T design was `[| a, b, c |]`, maybe could be more like that?

i'll be somewhat blunt: i continue to see the line of argument from extractor-proponents to be "for these technical reasons it's unrealistic to do this in tools"

that's fine! but that doesn't imply "engines will do it"

[21:18:55.0593] <shu>
i think the counterfactual that "people will write things that are even slower" is also just not true in this case, because pattern matching and extractors don't exist?

[21:19:08.0834] <ljharb>
the things those will be used for are already done, just in other ways

[21:19:19.0083] <shu>
and if they don't want to write that verbose example that jordan posted above, that's good! the grossness of the example correlates with the slowness

[21:19:31.0546] <ljharb>
pattern matching is done with function calls and if/else and/or switch, extractors with separate function calls

[21:19:39.0580] <shu>
that seems good to me

[21:19:47.0317] <shu>
their verbosity gives a hint to the work they're doing

[21:20:15.0108] <ljharb>
i'm not sure the point of programming languages is to have verbosity correlate to cost?

Extractors are actually something that would be easy to do in Babel, just not fast/small

[21:20:22.0451] <rbuckton>
Pattern matching results in far more readable code than the current approach.

[21:20:33.0782] <shu>
if a terser and more readable thing can be a near zero-cost abstraction, that's great

[21:20:39.0889] <rbuckton>
The verbosity makes it harder to reason over.

[21:20:45.0582] <shu>
if it can't be, we gave our position yesterday on the cost to users

[21:21:20.0108] <Bradford Smith>
My concern with Extractors is that they seem overly clever to me. They hide what's happening from the developer too much, leading them to incorrect ideas about how expensive they are.

[21:21:29.0115] <shu>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> i'm not sure the point of programming languages is to have verbosity correlate to cost?

the point of programming languages is to write applications that have some value to users of the applications

[21:21:33.0908] <ljharb>
indeed

[21:21:38.0196] <rbuckton>
pattern matching can be more efficient than the alternative if we have sufficient caching and reuse across multiple branches of the pattern.

[21:21:39.0266] <keith_miller>
Sure but that's still 48 byte codes in JSC today:

Pulling this into the main channel. This would be sufficiently complex (48 byte codes) that this would be no longer considered for inlining under JSC's current heuristic.

[21:27:03.0046] <keith_miller>
From one statement

[21:27:50.0889] <keith_miller>
Which I *don't* think devs would expect

[21:28:20.0583] <rbuckton>
JSC inlining is limited to the statement level?

[21:28:38.0581] <keith_miller>
It's limited by the number of bytes in the instruction stream

If extractors ends up needing to use array-as-object destructuring, then yeah, that's a possibility.

I put it in a thread for that reason?

[21:39:30.0308] <rbuckton>
Does the bytecode for the `Optional.some[Symbol.customMatcher]` include the cost of looking up `customMatcher` on Symbol? A native implementation would be able to avoid that because it would be using a known symbol.

Ah fair, sorry. I assumed that was the standard.

[21:40:43.0342] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> and readable code correlates to that value, imo often more highly than the performance of that application

I agree with Jordan, extractor give u a simple abstraction and shorter code. such feature will improve the code quality generally (not only perf, but also many other aspects).

that's just 1~3 steps i guess

[21:40:51.0654] <keith_miller>
Sure, that would be avoided but that's not too much of the code generated

At least extractors are not a hidden cost you stumble into, unlike getters/setters or let/const TDZ. You don't pay the cost if you don't use extractors, and so long as developers are aware of the cost (and that cost is not absurdly high), developers can balance the pros and cons and fall back to existing behaviors for high performance scenarios. I think the part of concern is that developers might blindly adopt extractors without considering the cost?

extractors are quite similar to let/const, they hide the cost of the operation behind what looks like light weight syntax

[21:47:43.0435] <shu>
here's a really simple, clean looking code (multiple delegates have said as such, **i** also think it looks very clean and nice) that hides a pretty expensive operation that doesn't exist in other languages that inspired this feature!

[21:47:55.0513] <Michael Ficarra>
@yulia:mozilla.org no more so than positional destructuring

[21:47:56.0466] <keith_miller>
Yeah the syntax is 💯 hiding the cost! That's exactly what I was trying to show!

[21:47:59.0471] <rbuckton>
The syntax looks like a function call, part of the benefit of that is that the expectation is that it will have the cost of a function call.

[21:48:20.0915] <shu>
do you think a rust or haskell programmer look at pattern matching and think that's a function call?

[21:48:34.0464] <canadahonk>
couldn't the same be said with array destructuring?

[21:48:39.0553] <bakkot>
yes

[21:48:40.0926] <shu>
yeah?

[21:48:41.0702] <yulia>
yes, 

[21:48:43.0736] <shu>
array destructuring is terrible

[21:48:50.0030] <keith_miller>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> @yulia:mozilla.org no more so than positional destructuring

Sure and I think engines would consider that was a mistake

[21:48:51.0546] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
A function calling is also a very simple syntax (and can hide cost). I don't see there is any diff.

[21:49:39.0891] <keith_miller>
In every language a function call is a significant cost

[21:50:06.0200] <keith_miller>
Maybe if you're clever you can get the compiler to remove a lot of that but IMO devs know that's on them

function calls and things like array destructing / extractors are also completely different levels of fundamental; can't really imagine a modern language without functions, but the other 2 are much more optional

If they're expected to know that `const p = Point(x, y)` has a cost, they won't be expected to know that `const Point(x, y) = p` does as well?

[21:51:48.0020] <Bradford Smith>
Also, there is no restriction in the Extractors proposal on just how expensive that function may be. It could do anything. The examples assume they will always "undo" a constructor call, but there's no reason to believe it would stay restricted to that in practice.

No because no other binding in the language has a cost. let/const is a great example of this in the sense that people didn't expect there would be a cost there.

If a specific extracting logic is complex and cost , then it always there, people just write it in some other form, and generally speaking, average programmers normally write much slower code repeatly and every place. On the other side, extractor allow senior programmer factor the logic and do optimization in single place and provide other an easy to adoption syntax. 

[21:53:59.0074] <Bradford Smith>
My point is, part of the assumption of improved readability is assuming that the feature will be used in a particular way. I expect it would be abused to make code "magically" shorter.

Yes they do, `const [x, y]` has a cost. Extractors have an obvious cost because they are explicitly designed to run user code, that's the whole point.

[21:55:13.0581] <keith_miller>
I think it's non-obvious. Maybe this would be worth a developer study?

[21:55:50.0845] <rbuckton>
Most developers don't think about iteration cost when they use `const [x, y]` because the possibility of iteration being expensive is hidden on the RHS, not the LHS. Extractors put that cost in your face by being on the LHS./

I only expect builtin syntax like object destructuing and array destructing to be fast enough. But extractor means custom matcher and it just like function, and I don't expect it is zero cost.

From what I understood, the problem is that it's still Firefox-centric. The ideal time to write docs is after that one implementation ships, and before stage 4. From Firefox's issue tracker, you can either get notified when a proposal reaches stage 3 (too early) or when Firerfox implements it (sometimes too late)

[22:26:05.0719] <yulia>
yep, thats true -- was giving some insight about how the process currently works

[22:26:17.0840] <yulia>
we don't actually tell MDN what to write about, and sometimes they write docs before we ship

[22:26:28.0467] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> we can't make something a requirement if it is entirely out of our control

True, their recommendation was actually "require that MDN folks have been notified in advance so that they can make sure to prioritise docs"

[22:26:29.0879] <yulia>
they just watch that issue for upcoming topics

[22:26:44.0628] <yulia>

[22:31:10.0139] <ptomato>
a coworker and I tried to get ahead of the game with Temporal docs for MDN, back when the proposal went to stage 3. it was a frustrating experience because it was blocked for months on getting a Temporal key into the browser compatibility data repo. I had to conclude that the process wasn't really navigable for outsiders. I don't think we can really require it from our side

[22:32:03.0936] <shu>
waldemar: it's not a full pre-parse phase, it's an eager, regular parse phase. pre-parse = parse for syntax errors, do not generate an AST, do not generate bytecode. regular parse = parse, generate an AST, and bytecode.

since pre-parse is default, it turns out slower for a function that's immediately executed to first pre-parse, then to do a full parse. so this is a hint to say "skip that initial pre-parse, because it's gonna be called immediately"

`/set mode +m`

[22:47:17.0745] <Rob Palmer>
Due to explicit lazy-loading, our system lends itself to loading code that is highly likely to be executed.  Prior to us rolling out client-side code-caching, we found maximal PIFEs sped up app load times.  The marginal cost of the unnecessary preparse was costing a lot (>100ms.). I believe the need for those legacy-style hints went away after we switch to bytecode caching with high hit rates (90%+ of modules hit the cache).  But for cache misses, I would expect the source hints to still be valuable.

it’s not just linters: if you use VS Code, then you will immediately get things marked if they are unused, kinda like a soft error, and with void, you wouldn’t get it marked. I guess tools could learn a convention like _a and do the same.

I agree, but `_` is special case. (it's already special in practice)

[00:01:33.0840] <ljharb>
the contention on the discard bindings proposal is that some think it is, and some think it's not. i think it's not.

[00:01:45.0870] <Justin Ridgewell>
Ron mentioned  that `when { x: y } => …` means that it’s matching that the object has the structure `{x}` and `x`’s current value is equal to `y`. Rust doesn’t have that, it only matches structure and extracts values, you use an additional `when { x } if (x === y) => …` to specify an exact value.

I’m missing context, what are they trying to say?

[00:03:55.0951] <rbuckton>
Regarding Rust pattern matching. Rust knows statically whether a RHS in a pattern is an existing binding or a new binding, JS does not. Any code could introduce a new global that could change the meaning of something like `match (value) { { x: x, y: y }: ... }`

[00:04:01.0529] <littledan>

well i do also respect the haters

[00:04:49.0019] <rbuckton>
Because JS cannot determine this statically, the pattern matching proposal says an identifier in a pattern is *always* reference. If you intend it to be a declaration, you must use `let`/`const`/`var` to declare it.

Not sure about it. I think people use `_` or `$` in no module era (before commonjs), it seems become less and less after we adopt modules, especially esm.

[00:06:08.0496] <danielrosenwasser>
The context is that you have a choice in pattern matching on whether a bare identifier denotes a new binding, or an existing binding to be checked against

In rust it's just syntax-based, right? i.e. in this case you are introducing a new binding `x`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 42;
    let y = Some(3);
    match y {
        Some(x) => println!("Some"),
        _ => println!("Other")
    }
}
```

It only really differs in how bindings are declared, by necessity.

You are always introducing a new binding `x`, you are never matching a value `y === Some(x)`

[00:08:03.0771] <Justin Ridgewell>
To match a value, you use an `if` check on the case

`Some(x):` may seem obvious, but what about just `{ x: Number }`. Should I be declaring a new variable named `Number` or referencing the `Number` constructor?

Do implementations need to declare the number of locals within a function? That increases the memory size of a function at runtime.

[00:09:37.0706] <yulia>

yep

[00:09:59.0305] <yulia>

 * yep (we do anyway)

[00:10:09.0258] <rbuckton>
So yes, there is probably a tiny benefit to implementations since they don't need to hold onto a local for those variables.

[00:10:29.0358] <rbuckton>
The spec text also skips adding a binding.

[00:10:38.0214] <Ashley Claymore>
I was thinking during the parse, rather than before the parse

For a `using` you still need to basically keep the "discarded" value around until the end of the scope, so even if it's not identifiable by a variable name, some work needs to happen.

[00:12:27.0584] <danielrosenwasser>
(right?)

[00:12:37.0327] <nicolo-ribaudo>
shu It's what the user reads in the callback of the event listener

> <@danielrosenwasser:matrix.org> For a `using` you still need to basically keep the "discarded" value around until the end of the scope, so even if it's not identifiable by a variable name, some work needs to happen.

For a `using`, there are two memory locations that hold the value. One is in the environment record for later disposal, the other is in the variable binding itself.

[00:12:54.0948] <yulia>
you would still do the whole parse before constructing the necessary stuff for the script's representation. so this wouldn't be a benefit during parse i think... i don't recall the details of the proposal right now -- if a const binding is void is that name disallowed in the function? im not sure it would help, that might just be more stuff to track and then throw errors on

[00:13:04.0274] <shu>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> shu It's what the user reads in the callback of the event listener

so "nullable" on that slide means "could be null in the case there was no JS code that triggered the dispatch"

[00:13:17.0566] <yulia>
you'd still have to do the full parse. but, we could discard it as part of our count of things that are local to the function, thats true

[00:13:24.0375] <yulia>
i don't think its a huge improvement

[00:14:35.0382] <nicolo-ribaudo>
```js

x.run("registration", () => {
  addEventListener("foo", () => { x.get() })
});

x.run("dispatch", () => {
dispatchEvent("foo")
})
```

[00:14:46.0035] <nicolo-ribaudo>
^ example of the two contexts

[00:15:02.0808] <nicolo-ribaudo>
If the dispatch happens from user interaction, than that's null

[00:15:10.0999] <nicolo-ribaudo>
If it's from JS code, there is something

[00:15:17.0853] <shu>
uh i forget the signature for run()

[00:16:11.0758] <Justin Ridgewell>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> uh i forget the signature for run()

The first param is the new internal value of the async var, the second is a callback that is invoked immedaitely. When the callback returns, the internal value is reset to the previous value.

"gently unsure" is such a great phrasing

[01:00:29.0753] <shu>
in general, for API features that are purely motivated by convenience, i'd like us to take a bigger scope view and do some prioritization

[01:00:49.0037] <shu>
michael has followed a program of 'make iterators more helpful', which i personally agree is well motivated

[01:01:08.0919] <shu>
but i do regularly hear the deficiency of the JS stdlib

[01:02:09.0106] <shu>
to take a personal pet peeve: we don't have some pretty basic data structures, like Queue, and people are using arrays to poorly emulate. how does something like that weigh against 'make iterators even more helpful'

[01:02:49.0007] <yulia>
yeah, thats a good question

[01:03:43.0729] <rkirsling>
is that a true statement? I have always viewed the push/pop/shift/unshift methods to imply that arrays simply _are_ stacks or queues or whatever

[01:04:24.0741] <ljharb>
arrays are sadly queues, and stacks, and lists, all at once

[01:04:37.0462] <shu>
there are crimes being done in the engine to support the expected algorithmic complexity of queue vs stack vs random-access arrays

[01:04:42.0332] <shu>
that's what i meant by "poorly emulate" above

[01:04:59.0666] <Michael Ficarra>
also MultiMaps!

[01:05:00.0980] <shu>
yes, you can use them as such, but we'd also like have data structures fit for purpose

[01:05:18.0865] <Michael Ficarra>
please someone give us MultiMaps

[01:05:19.0419] <shu>
it might be a bit late

[01:05:36.0972] <rkirsling>
relative to which it would seem needlessly Java-like to demand a Queue or Stack class... but then that could _also_ have been an argument against Map (wrt Object), so

I use `Symbol.species` for Array subclasses when I don't want `.map`/`.filter` to produce an instance of the subclass because the constructor parameters differ.

[01:14:33.0032] <rbuckton>
Without it I have to override map, filter, slice, et al and provide my own implementation.

[01:14:47.0658] <shu>
that seems better

[01:14:58.0604] <rbuckton>
Not really.

[01:15:32.0110] <Ashley Claymore>
if we hadn't of done Symbol.species, wouldn't you have gotten your desired behaviour by default?

[01:16:06.0756] <rbuckton>
It's not that I need `Symbol.species`. It's that I need some way to tell the superclass to just produce `Array` and not my subclass.

[01:17:06.0880] <rbuckton>
Yes, if we didn't have symbol.species and the default behavior was not to try to produce an instance from the current constructor, that would have been acceptable.

[01:18:01.0678] <Ashley Claymore>
This is what we do in the new Array methods

[01:18:29.0420] <littledan>
XRegExp was a big source of type 4 stuff

[01:18:34.0882] <rbuckton>
But if you unship Symbol.species you need to choose whether to only return `Array` instances or to only return `this.constructor` instances. The question is who are you breaking by choosing one or the other.

[01:19:02.0499] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I feel that "Yeah" very hard

[01:19:14.0872] <Ashley Claymore>
```
class MyArray extends Array {}
new MyArray().toSorted() instanceof MyArray; // false
```

[01:21:15.0562] <littledan>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> But if you unship Symbol.species you need to choose whether to only return `Array` instances or to only return `this.constructor` instances. The question is who are you breaking by choosing one or the other.

Yeah I suspect that Array and maybe Promise are more real than RegExp—more plausible to have not-just-polyfill usages

[01:21:15.0682] <rbuckton>
Essentially, I only use Symbol.species to work around the existence of Symbol.species.

Can we use AI to filter those cases

[01:22:26.0037] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Google is already shipping it in the browser

[01:22:36.0676] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It can run in the background and check all the loaded pages :)

[01:22:41.0325] <rbuckton>
I have no intuition as to how many people are subclassing `Array` and it actually matters that `.map()` et al produce a subclass. These implementations wouldn't be overriding `Symbol.species`, just using the default behavior.

[01:27:04.0339] <Justin Ridgewell>
Yah, Type II Array uses are probably genuine

[01:27:19.0998] <Justin Ridgewell>
It’s just too simple for a web dev to have written

[01:29:38.0440] <rbuckton>
Historically we've had two opposing positions on subclassing and overriding methods:
1. Overriding methods is bad because anyone can call `superclass.prototype.method.call(subclassinstance)` and ignore any behavior imposed by the subclass. The suggested solution was to somehow bake this information into the instance. Using `Symbol.species` falls under this category
2. Don't use `Symbol.species` and instead override methods.


[01:30:27.0124] <rbuckton>
For example, (1) was the approach considered for things like customizing keying for `Map`/`Set`.

[01:31:31.0459] <rbuckton>
1 and 2 aren't polar opposites, but they do cross purposes wrt Symbol.species and how/when to handle subclass construction for results.

[01:33:12.0423] <rbuckton>
A third approach is wrapping, but you cant wrap an `Array` due to its exotic nature.

[01:34:43.0975] <rbuckton>
(at least, not without a `Proxy`, which is hard to get right and slow)

[01:50:31.0047] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
`Symbol.species` provide a hook which just like protected member in OOP. Compare to other protocol I don't think it's inevitable evil. My question is why it's a static property? If it's a instance property, would it be better for the engines?

[02:55:10.0934] <Anthony Bullard>
I think the thing missed in this discussion is that in languages that do a ton of this, and where it’s fast (zero cost-ish or better) the extraction requires no function call or hidden user code.  It’s literally the same lookups and comparisons you can see in the patterns and possibly some branch caching.

If we got rid of Extractors with custom user code, 90% of concerns over hidden perf costs go away

huh, that was not my understanding

a Latin-1 string representation is identical to a byte array, where the Unicode character values would just be the byte values

[18:19:34.0878] <Marja Hölttä>
v8 has two types of strings, one-byte (latin1) and two-byte (not quite utf-16 but ucs... something... maybe ucs-2)

[18:20:43.0089] <Marja Hölttä>
and interestingly, it also has an utf-8 parser which is used during streaming compilation, it can do stuff like pause between characters if we need to wait for more data from the network. so in that case we don't use chromium's utf-8 parser but our own

> <@marjakh:matrix.org> and interestingly, it also has an utf-8 decoder which is used during streaming parsing, it can do stuff like pause mid-character if we need to wait for more data from the network. so in that case we don't use chromium's utf-8 decoder but our own

[18:35:09.0665] <Marja Hölttä>
based on very quick googling it seems that the difference between UCS-2 and UTF-16 is more than treating the ill-formed strings but my knowledge level is getting very shaky here

[18:35:42.0534] <Marja Hölttä>
ahh it has been rewritten since, okay that's good, i think 2 utf-8 decoders are enough for chromium

[18:35:58.0097] <Justin Ridgewell>
UCS-2 allows lone surrogates, UTF-16 doesn't

[18:36:03.0921] <Justin Ridgewell>
They’re the same otherwise

[18:38:17.0588] <Marja Hölttä>
google says "UCS-2 is fixed width, UTF-16 is variable width with a minimum of two bytes and a maximum of four bytes." << what about this part? no idea what v8 does here

[18:39:41.0088] <littledan>
IMO it’s more parsimonious to have a separate method

[18:40:06.0955] <Justin Ridgewell>
> <@marjakh:matrix.org> google says "UCS-2 is fixed width, UTF-16 is variable width with a minimum of two bytes and a maximum of four bytes." << what about this part? no idea what v8 does here

That’s if you want to combine surrogates into a single UTF char (u32). The streams themselves are the same.

[18:41:13.0061] <littledan>
I think the meaning of ucs2 has changed over time. It was designed in the days when all code points fit in 16 bits. Since then, it has been redefined to mean, potentially ill-formed utf16

[18:41:59.0912] <Justin Ridgewell>
Yah, baseically that ^

[18:42:10.0356] <Justin Ridgewell>
* Yah, basically that ^

[18:42:12.0369] <littledan>
JS generally does not check for well-formed-ness so you could (informally) say it works in the ucs2 encoding rather than utf16

[18:46:11.0503] <Marja Hölttä>
oh, and wtf-16 says it's the name kinda corresponding to that evolved usage of ucs-2. yess, not confusing at all. okay.

[18:50:09.0967] <Marja Hölttä>
ok how did we end up here? what does "Strings will deoptimize pretty quickly once you store non-utf8 bytes" mean? one thing that's not great about onebyte vs twobyte is that if you have one non-onebyte character in your string, the whole string has to be stored as a twobyte and it's slightly unnecessary overhead.

[18:50:56.0863] <Marja Hölttä>
(but i don't see a way around it in the current world unless we add utf-8 strings and... i don't think anyone wants to... strings are incredibly complex as is)

I mistakenly though that `String.fromCharCode(0x80)` returned a 2-byte string representation

[18:53:59.0996] <littledan>
* No I wasn’t talking about volatile read-only views on an underlying changing ArrayBuffer

[18:54:19.0377] <Justin Ridgewell>
`0x80` being an illegal UTF-8 lead byte

[18:55:01.0194] <Justin Ridgewell>
You can construct strings in memory that holds any byte sequence, you just can’t transfer that string over the wire

[18:55:47.0574] <Justin Ridgewell>
A UTF-8 parser on the other end will replace bad byte sequences with the Replacement Char

[18:56:31.0453] <littledan>
I am also OK keeping the rw lock stuff outside of this proposal but I think it could make it more usable for certain cases, which could allow some more zero copy in practice. Not needed for the motivating embedded case though.

> <@marjakh:matrix.org> (but i don't see a way around it in the current world unless we add utf-8 strings and... i don't think anyone wants to... strings are incredibly complex as is)

Some hosts work with UTF-8 strings and would benefit from not having to convert when making them into JS string primitives. Whether that is offset by the cost of adding UTF-8 strings to the engine is a different question though

Or is there some other part that's not quite that?

[19:20:27.0303] <Justin Ridgewell>

`value & 255`

[19:20:34.0044] <keith_miller>
Err sorry

[19:20:35.0788] <keith_miller>
Yeah

[19:20:57.0425] <Andreu Botella (at TC39, 🕐 JST)>
or `value % 256`

[19:21:14.0158] <littledan>
That’s how normal uint8arrays work; I thought clamped was different 

[19:21:41.0709] <littledan>
What if we added a Math.clamp method? I think that would be a broadly useful utility.

[19:21:56.0946] <Justin Ridgewell>
^CSS did, not us

[19:21:59.0800] <yulia>
right but what are we solving exactly rn?

[19:22:02.0698] <ljharb>
so the spec logic is https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-touint8clamp

[19:22:24.0465] <ljharb>
if all those steps are just `value & 255` then an editorial cleanup would certainly have helped :-)

[19:22:25.0986] <shu>

[19:22:32.0438] <shu>
you said it wans't described in algo steps

[19:22:40.0956] <rbuckton>

Is this asking about Math.clamp? That is just saving a couple lines of code, making everyday things slightly nicer. Also fine by me to not do.

[19:23:44.0071] <Michael Ficarra>
FYI we also didn't get a summary for the previous topic

[19:24:24.0318] <keith_miller>

Yeah it doesn’t really have to do with data views, it’s just like you give a min and max and return one of those if you are out of bounds

[19:26:03.0588] <yulia>
sure, that sounds fine

[19:26:40.0797] <rbuckton>
yulia: I have code that could make use of consistent names for data view methods for the purpose of dynamic dispatch, were it to be rewritten to use dynamic dispatch: https://github.com/esfx/esfx/blob/main/packages/struct-type/src/internal/numbers.ts#L122-L133 one data point may not necessarily be compelling, however.

[21:44:54.0849] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>

dynamic import will call `then` 😭

[21:45:16.0968] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
I always think it's a mistake.

[21:45:25.0063] <waldemar>
Yeah. That seems a bit troublesome…

[21:47:01.0638] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>

Production. 

[22:01:06.0860] <Mathieu Hofman>
I'm not on the call now, what is the problem with lazy evaluating on export access?

[22:01:23.0326] <bakkot>
thenables

[22:03:06.0665] <Justin Ridgewell>
Specifically the promise resolution of the dynamic import triggers the evaluation

[22:04:24.0207] <Mathieu Hofman>
I understand that. But it just means that only thenable modules wouldn't be lazy evaluated. More precisely the promise logic doing get then would trigger evaluation

[22:04:44.0658] <Mathieu Hofman>
* I understand that. But it just means that only thenable modules wouldn't be lazy evaluated. More precisely the promise logic doing get then would trigger their evaluation

[22:05:08.0871] <Mathieu Hofman>
It wouldn't affect any other kind of modules

[22:05:33.0052] <bakkot>
any property access triggers evaluation

[22:05:37.0914] <bakkot>
and you have to access `.then`

[22:06:18.0065] <Mathieu Hofman>
Right so what's the problem to trigger evaluation of thenable modules

[22:06:33.0258] <Ashley Claymore>
it triggers all modules

[22:06:36.0603] <bakkot>
`Promise.resolve(foo)` accesses `foo.then`

[22:06:43.0888] <bakkot>
regardless of whether `foo` has a `.then`

[22:06:57.0756] <Mathieu Hofman>
I'm just saying if the module is non thenable, it wouldn't trigger evaluation. All good

[22:07:14.0578] <bakkot>
any property access triggers evaluation

[22:07:23.0334] <bakkot>
the property does not have to exist to trigger evaluation

[22:07:40.0099] <bakkot>
and sticking the module namespace object into a promise triggers access of `.then`

[22:07:52.0052] <bakkot>
and dynamic import sticks the module namespace object into a promise

[22:07:58.0968] <Mathieu Hofman>
But that's what I'm asking. Why can't we defer evaluation to access of a known export

[22:08:56.0794] <shu>
when would you trigger the evaluation

[22:09:02.0672] <Mathieu Hofman>
You don't need to evaluate to know what is exported 

[22:09:24.0444] <shu>
Promise.resolve accesses .then, it doesn't ask if it has a .then

[22:09:33.0876] <Mathieu Hofman>
When you do get then or any prop access for known exports 

[22:09:53.0260] <shu>
which Promise.resolve does, it gets .then

[22:10:00.0199] <shu>
what is happening

[22:10:58.0157] <ljharb>
i think what mathieu is suggesting is that we _change_ promise resolution so that _for a deferred namespace object_, it doesn't access `.then` unless that's an export of the module?

[22:11:20.0859] <Chris de Almeida>
I see stuff dropping off the queue, but we have time to continue discussion

[22:11:22.0568] <shu>
where do you put this, inside step 9 of https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-promise-resolve-functions?

[22:13:03.0512] <Ashley Claymore>

the official spec knows. But userland bundlers may not know

[22:14:22.0713] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> web compat, people were already relying on thenable modules in production

Also expense/complexity of adding another property access to this hot path of promise resolution 

[22:16:24.0772] <littledan>
About the use cases for import.defer: we had an internal meeting in Bloomberg before TC39, and we couldn’t come up with a real use case. The case Ashley raised doesn’t occur in our infrastructure—it is very hypothetical. Personally I think removing the dynamic import.defer feature and not doing this namespace censorship is the right tradeoff for avoiding complexity

[22:17:06.0695] <yulia>
i feel like you can get what you want with dynamic import + static defer inside the dynamically imported graph

[22:17:22.0836] <yulia>
but let me check internally as well, we might have a use case. at the moment i can't think of anything

[22:17:43.0020] <ljharb>
i guess you could maybe get it with `import()` of a data URI that does a static deferred import and re-export?

[22:17:50.0970] <yulia>
yeah exactly

[22:18:14.0847] <Mathieu Hofman>
 Sorry afk, will formulate more clearly soon

[22:18:30.0730] <yulia>
because `import.defer` is fundamentally different from the static import defer: static import defer is always a module graph edge. In the case of import.defer we are deferring the module root

I want to see a future where WASM module instantiation is handled transparently in the ESM universe. WASM source imports are a step in the right direction, but I want to see instantiation handled via import defer at some point. And dynamic loading of WASM sources is definitely a use case.

The problem is the function coloring…

[22:30:00.0509] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> I assumed the idea was that you'd know the names before triggering evaluation

There are two possible implementations of this proposal:
- one (trivial) is that you follow the spec to the word, and eagerly pre-load and pre-parse the module and its dependencies. In this case, you always have access to the list of export names before evaluation.
- the other one is that you only collect some minimal metadata (does it have a dep with TLA? does it have syntax errors?) about modules before executing the app, and then skip loading/parsing entirely. You obviously cannot do this if you need to fetch files from the network, but that's often not the case (Node.js, the various edge runtimes, browser caches). This is the approach that gives the most benefits.

With the second approach you _can_ get the list of exports in this pre-execution phase, but it's more metadata you have to maintain.

Bundlers are very similar to to the second case, except that they currently need _no metadata_: the way to bundle deferred modules is to wrap them in a function, and thus:
- you already are protected against syntax errors
- there is no TLA, because that's handled by injecting the async module outside of the deferred function

[22:30:57.0875] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> Import source + import() covers some of these cases though

Well, also `const wasm = import.source(...)` + `WebAssembly.instantiate(wasm)` covers it in a sync way

[22:31:31.0060] <littledan>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> Well, also `const wasm = import.source(...)` + `WebAssembly.instantiate(wasm)` covers it in a sync way

Kinda, but then you don’t get the native imports

[22:32:15.0453] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh true -- it only covers the many of the cases but not all of them

WASM source imports are a step in the right direction, but I want to see instantiation handled via import defer at some point. And dynamic loading of WASM sources is definitely a use case.

I agree with this goal about Wasm/ESM integration, and now understand the case better where this feature will be useful, but then I  wonder who will be sophisticated enough to do this import.defer() idiom in order to split up compilation vs instantiation cost (and what policy should even be used)

[22:42:08.0560] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> I assumed the idea was that you'd know the names before triggering evaluation

This exactly. My understanding is that all exported names of a module are known without evaluating the module. That means technically we could model this as an object with known props and the first access (get, gOPD) on one of these props would trigger the evaluation of the module. That way the import.defer of a non thenable module does not trigger the evaluation of the module. But if the module is thenable, then of course the regular promise logic will trigger evaluation when it does a get of then

[22:44:07.0263] <yulia>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> The problem is the function coloring…

can you elaborate? not familiar with the wasm usecase so well, so i don't know how import.defer solves this better than import source + import()

[22:44:25.0685] <ptomato>
are any slides intended to be shared right now?

[22:44:26.0740] <yulia>
because thats a good point, import.source and then import later is possibly another solution?

[22:45:28.0255] <shu>
i don't really see the priority on making evaluation-phase wasm ESM integration work well

[22:45:37.0821] <shu>
you gotta do something to pass in the imports

[22:45:49.0289] <shu>
it seems like it's just composed import.source then an instantiate

[22:46:04.0026] <shu>
the hard problems about actually making wasm modules participate in the module graph is solved by import.source

in a pure ESM  spec world yes. But ecosystem tooling has to deal with less concrete situations. Not relying on knowing the keys is a big help for tooling that emulates ESM

[22:48:06.0608] <Ashley Claymore>
dropping `import.defer` looks like it has more of a win

[22:48:18.0337] <Mathieu Hofman>
I thought that static analyzability of module exports was one of the main point of ESM? Are you saying you want to import.defer other module types where export names are not known ahead of time?

[22:49:35.0798] <Ashley Claymore>
Tools like Babel will transform ESM to CommonJS one module at a time, without that global info

[22:50:53.0727] <Ashley Claymore>
it's doable, but adds complexity to tooling. Dropping `import.defer` is a solution that reduces complexity instead of moving it.

[23:50:05.0349] <rbuckton>
`bigint` could never have been JSSugar due to operator overloading. Neither could decimal as a primitive.

[23:50:59.0253] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Unless we introduce escaped operators like "a \+ b" that desugars to a.add(b) :)

[23:51:52.0395] <Ashley Claymore>

absent type-driven stuff, you can be like ocaml and have +.

I can see healthy discussions where engines ask "Can this go in JSSugar?" and then tooling authors come back and say "This would result in way too much bundle bloat"

[00:25:28.0150] <yulia>
restricting things to ast transform would reduce complexity. right now you have free reign in what you can do, and that can introduce new bytecode operations etc. if its an AST transform, it is quite literally sugar as it can be rewritten

[00:26:21.0430] <ljharb>
would that as a constraint remove the need for jssugar?

[00:27:07.0090] <yulia>
So again, mozilla isn't strictly supporting JSSugar as the solution here, we are co-signers of the problem

[00:27:27.0904] <yulia>

[00:28:09.0412] <shu>
the implication from that is we are designing features wrong (for performance)

[00:28:19.0504] <yulia>
I don't want to say yes, but certain proposals currently in the pipeline that are not AST transforms (introducing custom behavior) would be significantly simpler if they were; for example explicit resource management

rbuckton: do y'all collect analytics on targets?

[00:31:46.0311] <rbuckton>
I'd have to get back to you on that

[00:33:12.0909] <littledan>
Have we nailed down the details for which features have which cost? Seems like we should study this more and see what is possible to change, though the response to Shu’s tdz effort was disappointing 

[00:33:35.0255] <Rob Palmer>
Side note:  Do we know which old features are slow?  I only know of the TDZ issue.  We run most of our production code using very modern untranspiled ES2023/ES2024.  Performance has not been problematic, and in obviously is much faster than if we downlevelled private field usage or async usage.

How much slower are classes these days, after those optimizations you mentioned?

[00:34:21.0038] <Rob Palmer>
Profiling classes is my hobby.  I have not seen any lingering issues.

[00:34:39.0727] <littledan>

gotta ask a more specific question

[00:34:58.0136] <littledan>

Do you have any evidence to share that classes are slow?

[00:35:30.0920] <Marja Hölttä>
when i was looking into it, i noticed that one thing classes can't do is omitting super ctors. some tools, when they notice the super ctor doesn't do anything interesting, just omit it when doing old-style classes. or they inline the super ctor workload into the subclass ctor and then omit it.

[00:36:26.0960] <Marja Hölttä>
i optimized it a bit in v8, omitting trivial ctors, but it's still not as good as the oldschool version iirc.

[00:36:52.0853] <Ashley Claymore>
So potentially it's for deeper class hierarchies where the issues become more measurable?

[00:37:27.0611] <rbuckton>
In principle, implementers could also implement AST transforms in the runtime.

[00:37:32.0995] <Marja Hölttä>
before i optimized it, the problem was pretty visible even for shallow class hiearchies (since 1 call is so much more than 0 calls)

[00:38:20.0579] <Ashley Claymore>
```
class NewSkol { field =1 }
vs
function OldSkol() { this.field = 1 }
```

I assume these are very close in performance these days? Assuming `Object.prototype` hasn't been patched

Good point!!

[00:40:24.0066] <yulia>
yeah this is a side bar that we've been discussing. But if it expands to a massive subtree that would potentially be a problem. We should go through the full exercise of JSSugar first before we start talking about this part

[00:40:35.0791] <shu>

At least class is faster than `function OldSkol() { return {field: 1} }` ? (I'm not sure)

[00:40:44.0246] <shu>
i was referring to TS, littledan 

[00:41:26.0883] <yulia>
I mean, this is also about _how_ we are defining syntax right now

[00:42:27.0715] <Marja Hölttä>
i don't have the current numbers but i can look into it

[00:43:13.0775] <Marja Hölttä>
probably that case should be on par

[00:44:14.0245] <Marja Hölttä>
 * another class topic: private fields vs just normal fields

[00:44:23.0061] <Marja Hölttä>
idk the exact overhead but i assume it's non-zero

[00:44:59.0741] <Ashley Claymore>
Maybe the `define` vs the `set` still holds it back a little. I _think_ some tools might convert the class into:

```
class NewSkol { 
  constructor() {
    this.field = 1
  }
}
```


[00:45:08.0942] <rbuckton>
If a goal of JSSugar is for runtimes to look at desugared syntax to determine whether it is something to optimize, is there a reason runtimes aren't already doing this?

[00:45:25.0016] <Ashley Claymore>
I think that _used_ to be faster, in the past

[00:45:32.0678] <shu>
wait, where was that a goal

[00:45:51.0004] <shu>
(and we are already doing this, we try to see patterns that common frameworks and other popular libs use)

[00:45:51.0295] <rbuckton>
Maybe not a goal, but you just made that statement two minutes ago

[00:45:58.0745] <shu>
i don't remember making that formulation

[00:46:02.0039] <shu>
but in any case, we do do this

[00:46:09.0001] <yulia>
we are doing this by default for all features, so anything that compiles down to current JS _is_ being targeted

[00:46:17.0389] <yulia>
because again, JS0 = current js

[00:50:35.0393] <keith_miller>
I recall one of places where classes were slow for no apparent benefit was empty constructors invoke the iterator protocol on `arguments` to forward them so you can't elide the call without a lot of optimizations. But maybe I'm misremembering that?

[00:50:55.0693] <Justin Ridgewell>
We fixed that

[00:51:00.0276] <shu>
i think we managed to fix that for default iterators

[00:51:10.0466] <shu>
the point marja was talking about is the `this` TDZ basically

[00:51:14.0788] <shu>
`super()` _must_ be there

[00:51:26.0466] <shu>
this is not true for ES5-style classes, so Closure can just straight up elide it

[00:51:35.0341] <keith_miller>
Ah right ok

while this is true, we're also huge TS -> ES5 users

[00:52:07.0121] <shu>
we didn't fix that if you typed `super(...arguments)` in _your_ constructor though

[00:53:06.0674] <rbuckton>
no `this` before `super()` is important to maintain expectations about superclass state. The fact you can run *any* statements before `super()` is perhaps a failing of the class syntax. 

[00:53:15.0103] <shu>
right

[00:53:26.0644] <shu>
and we've chatted about this before, but we should have designed it to be more static so the elision optiimzation can still apply

[00:53:30.0512] <shu>

[00:53:35.0676] <shu>

isn't this an example where features should be designed w/ engine optimization up front?

[00:54:42.0539] <shu>
no, the `super()` can't be elided thing is actually directly shown by a transpiler optimization that can no longer apply to ES6 classes that used to apply to ES5 classes

[00:55:04.0077] <rbuckton>
The fact you can forget to invoke the superclass constructor in an ES5-style class is a huge footgun, even if it is more performant.

[00:55:58.0724] <keith_miller>
`!super()` :P

[00:56:01.0239] <rbuckton>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> no, the `super()` can't be elided thing is actually directly shown by a transpiler optimization that can no longer apply to ES6 classes that used to apply to ES5 classes

The optimization being in the textual representation of having to write `constructor() { super(); ... }`, not in the possibility that the runtime might be able to optimize away a `super()` as the first statement?

[00:57:03.0655] <rbuckton>
IMO, we should have had something like `constructor() : super() { }` akin to C++ or C#

[00:57:43.0394] <rbuckton>
Where the absence of `: super()` implies you're invoking the superclass constructor with no arguments.

[01:01:56.0586] <rbuckton>
early prototypes of TypeScript experimented with a class syntax like `class C(a, b) { }` prior to the actual class syntax being standardized, which combined the constructor with the class name. C# actually has that now too.

[01:02:26.0048] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Omitting `this` checks after `super()` is probably one of the most complex optimizations we have to do in Babel due to the performance cost, and indeed there I'd expect engines to not be able to do it on-the-fly.

I'd be curious to see though if a Babel-transpiled subclass constructor is indeed slower than the same code running natively.

[01:02:34.0834] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Not comparing with "how would people write the class if it was ES5"

[01:02:42.0648] <nicolo-ribaudo>
But with what Babel actually emits

[01:02:52.0222] <rbuckton>
In C# you can now write 
```cs
class Sub(int x, int y) : Super(x, y)
{
  public X { get; set; } = x;
  public Y { get; set; } = y;
}
```

Although probably it's complex because we do it on an AST and not on a linear bytecode

[01:05:48.0137] <rbuckton>
We could always introduce slight alternatives to the `class` syntax that would make `super()` invocation implied, such as `class C(a, b) extends Super() {}`

Inlining the superclass ctor in an ES6 class wouldn't be sound since you can change it in JS via `Object.setPrototypeOf`. IMO, one of many problems with `class` design is that it was allowed to be too dynamic.

> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> what's the concrete thing you're thinking of? a different keyword than `struct`? or the messaging?

Only messaging. "It's fine to not further optimize classes, because people should migrate to structs anyway"

[01:58:44.0936] <nicolo-ribaudo>
And like, lint rules saying "use a struct here"

[01:59:07.0323] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Similarly to how the ecosystem migrated (at least, for hand-authored code) from var to let

> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> We could always introduce slight alternatives to the `class` syntax that would make `super()` invocation implied, such as `class C(a, b) extends Super() {}`

This is difficult to square with `this`: should references to an and b be spelled as `this.a` or just `a`? If bare, does it follow lexical scoping semantics or `this` semantics?

[02:30:07.0684] <littledan>
It would certainly bare an interesting analogy to Swift, where structs are preferred over classes (but the semantics are completely different!)

Also there is a question about how it interacts with super, as well as destructuring

[04:33:15.0893] <Marja Hölttä (not here, use marja@google.com)>
rbuckton: the "superclass" can also change in ES5; the tools were inlining the ctors were also assuming that the superclass won't change, because the program they're optimizing is well-behaved like that

[04:37:11.0906] <Marja Hölttä (not here, use marja@google.com)>

This would have been great. It’s also the only way I could see us doing sound immutable fields.

We have been trying to identify any real slowdowns and don’t see one in V8. If anyone is experiencing a slowdown of private compared to public in V8, I would love to hear from you; maybe we could sponsor work to do the appropriate optimization.

[04:42:15.0804] <littledan>

[04:45:19.0529] <littledan>
> <@yulia:mozilla.org> restricting things to ast transform would reduce complexity. right now you have free reign in what you can do, and that can introduce new bytecode operations etc. if its an AST transform, it is quite literally sugar as it can be rewritten

Yes, I agree that this would be a good design to follow where possible. And this is a great illustration of how, with slightly different mechanics, the needs of transpilers match the needs of interpreters. So we should work through both of those.

[04:47:16.0751] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> good luck designing, getting consensus, and getting people to adopt given TS :)

TS is pretty good; I don’t see a pressing reason to develop and bless something else (though more experimentation is always good!)

[04:49:57.0790] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> it's baking time with the world

Who do we expect to do this work? That is the question. I don’t see an easy answer. Tools have been pretty clear that most of them don’t want to ship features widely before they are baked. Same constraint as browsers! For the same reason: because it’s a lot of work to maintain these things if you set it up such that people can really use them in production.

[04:53:24.0793] <littledan>
> <@yulia:mozilla.org> can you elaborate? not familiar with the wasm usecase so well, so i don't know how import.defer solves this better than import source + import()

Import.defer() would let you have a promise for the initial load+compile, and then synchronously instantiate on first access. Import.source + import() makes the latter async. This is all assuming you want native ESM imports, which Shu is assuming you don’t. I share Ron’s view (which I think the WasmCG adopted…) that we should build towards this world even if we aren’t there yet.

[04:55:17.0742] <littledan>
Why would we expect the cost to be different in JSSugar vs this expansion?

[04:57:06.0593] <littledan>
But the custom code for extractors is much more direct than that of destructuring iterators

[04:58:14.0179] <littledan>
Splitting the proposal in two and shipping the browser part means we make less progress on the “let it bake before shipping” front.

[04:59:09.0763] <littledan>
Yes I like your 14 day goal, let’s see if we can change policy here.

[05:01:44.0206] <littledan>
So, how should we understand how bad this is? Is the length of the bytecode sufficient reason that we shouldn’t add such a feature to JSSugar even?

[05:27:51.0412] <yulia>
Ah got it

[05:28:05.0319] <yulia>
Ok so that is more of a use case I can understand 

[05:29:06.0052] <yulia>

* Let’s maybe talk about it next week, I need to better understand which options we would shut out if we do not do import.defer now

[06:31:58.0518] <littledan>
Overall I won’t be heartbroken if we shut out that possibility. There are lots of ways that the functionality could be recovered. But it is a coherent use case.

[10:50:48.0583] <Mathieu Hofman>
I'm worried that shutting off `import.defer` does not allow us to re-introduce it later unless we do resolve what deferred exactly implies, which caused this problem in the first place. I was honestly surprised that `import defer` had lazy eval on any ns property get, even if that property isn't a known export. I had assumed since the beginning the lazy eval was only triggered on access of known exports. I understand that the latter requires fetching and parsing exports of the module, but I always assumed that what the goal of this proposal, and it didn't intend to support deferred parsing as well.

[11:11:10.0657] <Ashley Claymore>
We *could* do `import.defer` later but it would have to either be a 3rd type of namespace different from the one returned by the static import. Or it would resolve to a wrapper object around the namespace. Or maybe there would be some other API all together. So door wouldn't be completely closed

for those kind of features, which i suspect is rarer, indeed the feedback loop with performance (now tool codegen performance) is very similar to that of browsers. but i don't really quite get why that's such a zinger. i mean, yeah, it's a maintenance cost! that's why browsers don't wanna do it, for the reason of great cost to the users

if the tools, for those features, decide they *also* don't want to shoulder the cost, then as i keep repeating, it does not follow from that that browsers continue to shoulder the cost. it follows from that that we aren't designing features or right, or it's a feature that we shouldn't have

it also provides a then function in case you dynamic import it, it no longer need to await init().

adding unthenable to all module namespaces will break this, but I don't think those packages are widely adopted via native esmodule

> <@marjakh:matrix.org> Michael Ficarra: the most chrome / v8 bugs are not because our C++ is doing memory management wrong, they are because we have a logic bug in generating machine code or because our invariants are extremely complex and one part might make a change which violates an invariant somewhere else. happy to talk more about this. interestingly, a huge proportion of the CVEs listed on shu's slide were in my code, and none of my bugs were because of C++, and would've happened even if V8 was written in a memory safe language.

GraalJS takes an approach that ensures JIT-produced code is memory-safe by construction without sacrificing perf: https://medium.com/graalvm/writing-truly-memory-safe-jit-compilers-f79ad44558dd

[14:00:06.0978] <shu>
i'm not sure why there's a connection between partial evaluation and the heap sandbox?

[14:01:36.0823] <shu>
the thesis of the article is that because graal partially evaluates an interpreter, this class of bugs is avoided

[14:02:35.0645] <shu>
but a heap sandbox is about protecting memory representation being exploited by an attacker, which _can_ arise from type confusion bugs due to JIT bugs, but can also just arise through other vectors

[14:04:55.0259] <shu>
a partial evaluator doesn't avoid that by construction. it can avoid some of the attack surface, though, and is a cool technique

[14:07:42.0328] <shu>
the heap sandbox would need to exist at the JVM or the native codegen layer in the GC runtime if you're bundling a GC, not really at the compilation layer. the graal thesis still requires that your interpreter is correct, or all the object runtime code that deal with actual representation of your objects are bug-free, right? the point of the heap sandbox is that it's another containment layering assuming that the VM is already pwned, which is... closer to reality imo

[14:08:39.0840] <shu>
also caveats about "without sacrificing performance" which seems to be about peak performance yada yada yada

[14:18:27.0761] <Michael Ficarra>
yes, see this quote:

> This architecture is standard — both the JVM and V8 use it — but viewed from a security perspective the design has a flaw: it’s error prone. The language semantics are implemented twice, once for the interpreter and again for the JIT compiler. It’s critical not only that both places are fully correct but also that they exactly match. Otherwise, the VM becomes exploitable.

[14:19:15.0290] <Michael Ficarra>
assuming you have a correct interpreter, you don't have a second implementation (the JIT) which introduces its own bugs or just differences in behaviour

[14:27:31.0800] <shu>
but that's a narrower class of bugs than the heap sandbox is designed for

[14:28:26.0017] <shu>
i.e., the heap sandbox is defense in depth assuming several class of bugs. this blogpost is saying, our technique can sidestep one such class of bugs


2024-10-23
[18:47:30.0627] <Mathieu Hofman>
I suppose it's easier to prove that an interpreter can only affect the heap of the interpreted language in the first place? At that point an explicit heap sandbox may be redundant? 

[18:49:33.0716] <Mathieu Hofman>
That's possibly where writing an interpreter in a memory safe language would help: you can reason that the only memory you can reach is the one allocated to represent the heap of the language you're interpreting.

[18:51:26.0824] <Mathieu Hofman>
of course you can still have bugs in the interpreter that would break the memory safety of the language you're interpreting. but you can't escape out to affect the memory of the rest of the process.

[20:03:46.0086] <shu>
> <@mhofman:matrix.org> That's possibly where writing an interpreter in a memory safe language would help: you can reason that the only memory you can reach is the one allocated to represent the heap of the language you're interpreting.

if the memory safe language is a GCed language you still want a sandbox around *that* heap

[20:03:58.0319] <shu>
like, the target GCed language's GC heap

[20:04:19.0489] <shu>
> <@mhofman:matrix.org> of course you can still have bugs in the interpreter that would break the memory safety of the language you're interpreting. but you can't escape out to affect the memory of the rest of the process.

why not?

[20:04:32.0244] <shu>
it depends on how the underlying memory safe language's memory safety is implemented, right?

[20:06:45.0063] <Mathieu Hofman>
Right that assumes the interpreter is implemented in a memory safe language 

[20:07:56.0875] <Mathieu Hofman>
But I don't see how the fact the interpreted language is GCed is relevant here. 

[20:10:34.0713] <Mathieu Hofman>
And if it's the language of the interpreter that is GCed, of course it assumes that language is memory safe, including its GC

[19:01:05.0397] <Anthony Bullard>
To be clear, the creator here was going off an unsympathetic article discussing it and the slides with no talk track.  And he is generally ambivalent towards JS particularly the tooling - which this proposal would lean into

[19:02:57.0387] <Anthony Bullard>
My main takeaway:  people are worried about two main things - a further increase in the role of tooling in the JS ecosystem (an already complex landscape), and the impact that pushing desugaring into the packaging layer will have on bundle sizes.

[19:04:20.0134] <Anthony Bullard>
Also debugging is always a talking point with this (compilation/transpilation) as many source map tools in practice are found wanting.

[19:06:16.0889] <Anthony Bullard>
Lastly, there is for many a philosophical objection to a official separation of the language into a superset for users willing/able to leverage these tools and those people who just want to write JS and run it.  Relatedly, some disgruntlement on how all this is necessary for a nominally interpreted language.

[19:06:28.0255] <shu>

i mean the parsing and bytecode generation step is theoretically pure, no? like if you could generate an RCE with a change to it, you could also generate an RCE with a specially crafted input without that change.

[06:07:30.0305] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> good luck getting people to also volunteer time for PR, i guess

TC39 and web standards are all about broad consensus-building. We don't really have a private back room where deals can be made that don't align with the rest of the JavaScript community, because we are all part of it and listening to each other. If one person doesn't have time for some parts of this consensus-building, then they can work with other allies/co-champions to help explain things broadly. I haven't watched any of the videos but I agree with a lot of the points of criticism that have been raised, including Anthony's summary above.

[06:09:45.0746] <littledan>
I think we need to examine some more concrete proposals and how they are affected by the concerns raised in the JSSugar presentation. I don't think we actually have a lot of non-trivial sugar proposals coming up [if the trivial ones like void aren't considered have a lot of cost]--mostly it's just pattern matching and extractors. So let's go deeper into examining that one and see how these concerns are related.

[06:10:39.0524] <littledan>
The biggest problem I heard with extractors was that array destructuring is slow. What if we can change the semantics of array destructuring to always do the original iteration semantics if it's given an actual Array? That would make it much easier to optimize.

[06:10:47.0788] <littledan>
(tbd if that is web-compatible)

[06:12:42.0005] <littledan>
we also need to strengthen critical analysis of proposals in general, if people feel like we're letting things through which aren't worth it. Such proposals probably shouldn't be included in sugar either. I hope TG5 can help, though past efforts have held themselves to a very high level of scientific rigor, preventing them from drawing conclusions.

> <@littledan:matrix.org> The biggest problem I heard with extractors was that array destructuring is slow. What if we can change the semantics of array destructuring to always do the original iteration semantics if it's given an actual Array? That would make it much easier to optimize.

What does "original iteration semantics" mean here? 

[06:19:14.0913] <littledan>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> What does "original iteration semantics" mean here?

I mean, the behavior of the original Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] and %ArrayIterator%.prototype.next

[06:19:23.0523] <littledan>
i.e. the ES5 downleveling semantics

[06:19:43.0100] <littledan>
so it'd check IsArray and branch to that, otherwise eagerly convert it to an array and do the same

[06:20:24.0955] <littledan>
(we'd only do this for destructuring, and leave for-of loops intact)

[06:21:25.0840] <littledan>
so the hard part will be checking web compatibility. (I hope we can avoid getting stuck like the recent Mozilla species investigation, finding a non-answer and not feeling like it's worth it to allocate resources to keep going.)

[06:26:20.0653] <littledan>
any thoughts on that idea?

[06:58:52.0347] <bakkot>
not sure why we'd special-case destructuring and not all other uses of the iteration protocol

[06:59:12.0686] <bakkot>
but I would be happy to make array iteration special, in whatever way

[07:00:03.0664] <littledan>
well, this is a simpler use case of it, with no early return, and especially easy to implement an eager conversion function for the slow path without changing semantics. But yeah I'd be happy to generalize it to all iteration if we find that that's web-compatible

[07:00:20.0087] <littledan>
arguably we already special-cased it for the default subclass constructor, so...

[07:15:37.0914] <littledan>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> not sure why we'd special-case destructuring and not all other uses of the iteration protocol

how do you feel about special-casing random cases of iteration when it's especially easy/useful/proven to be web-compatible? does it seem too unprincipled?

[07:16:55.0977] <bakkot>
eh... it's not that I'm opposed on principle, but in practice, I would be kinda surprised if those random cases are web-compat and other cases aren't, and if we're going to run the risk of trying it seems a shame not to get all the wins we can

[07:17:24.0450] <littledan>
fair, yeah let's see if we can do it

[07:48:13.0758] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> I mean, the behavior of the original Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] and %ArrayIterator%.prototype.next

I don't understand why this can't be a transparent optimization when the [Symbol.Iterator] function === %Array.prototype.values% ?

[07:51:00.0101] <Mathieu Hofman>
In general, if we know that the iterator making function is an intrinsic, we know what behavior the iterator will have and it doesn't need to actually be created if the spec itself is doing the iterating, no?

[07:52:06.0803] <Mathieu Hofman>
I mean sure we can spell it out in the spec, but that wouldn't be observable, and usually we don't spell out things that are unobservable optimizations

[08:34:35.0348] <bakkot>
the proposal would be to change the spec so that implementations don't have to do the quite complicated bookkeeping to ensure that all the array iterator machinery is intac

[08:34:36.0528] <bakkot>
 * the proposal would be to change the spec so that implementations don't have to do the quite complicated bookkeeping to ensure that all the array iterator machinery is intact

[08:34:43.0281] <bakkot>
 * the proposal would be to change the spec so that implementations don't have to do the quite complicated bookkeeping to ensure that all the array iterator machinery is intact before they can do that optimization

[08:35:25.0312] <bakkot>
"it is ok for this to be uselessly complicated because a sufficiently smart engine could make it fast anyway" is not that compelling of an argument

[08:36:34.0029] <bakkot>
if you're just writing an interpreter that sort of optimization is fairly easy but once you're trying to do codegen it gets pretty complicated

[08:38:51.0668] <littledan>
also this optimization has the cool property that you can also implement it in a desugaring (with a small support library). And you have to desugar destructuring if you want to, e.g., implement extractors in a transpiler.

[08:39:42.0983] <littledan>
and you have to check for two things: whether Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator] is the original value, and whether %ArrayIteratorPrototype%.next is the original value

[08:39:59.0338] <littledan>
it's not free to maintain a bit in advance for this check

[09:31:49.0203] <shu>
and we definitionally have a back room. people on twitter and youtube comments can't come and break consensus in tc39!

[09:50:48.0718] <littledan>
they can't break consensus, but it's all the same broader conversation, and points of view from outside of committee can influence committee members. We purposely operate in the open.

[09:52:04.0502] <littledan>
"broad consensus-building" doesn't mean everyone in that broad group vetoes things. As Michael Saboff has pointed out, consensus doesn't always mean this veto-driven thing that we do.

[09:59:29.0272] <shu>
i'm still unclear what you're getting at

[09:59:58.0411] <shu>
we're not running public campaigns for proposals

 * i'm assuming you don't think private fields were a giant mistake given the negative public reaction

[10:02:56.0698] <littledan>
yeah that's a good example of where we definitely did have a public conversation with mixed views from outside and we drew a conclusion in committee. I'm not talking about external groups having a veto, but I did make a specific effort to explain outwardly what it was about, and work with non-committee-members and people doing public-facing communication/education.

[10:03:46.0126] <littledan>
I don't think all proposal champions need to do this, but it's good to have people in the coalition working on a proposal who want to interact with people outside of committee.

[10:04:18.0074] <littledan>
it's a normal activity for TC39. But there are lots of normal activities that only a subset of us do, because there's just so much to do.

[10:05:46.0348] <littledan>
private fields took longer because we made an honest attempt to understand and engage with this external feedback. It was frustrating for me at the time, but I think we should continue to do that (though maybe somehow timeboxed where it makes sense)

[10:08:53.0865] <shu>
i think we drew pretty different conclusions from that episode

[10:09:05.0832] <shu>
and i disagree that it should be a normal activity for tc39

[10:09:23.0012] <shu>
there's the abstract problem of "developer signal" which _should_ be a normal activity for tc39

[10:09:28.0420] <shu>
but this particular form of it, most definitely not

[10:11:37.0173] <littledan>
Yeah I think we can leave this as, we agree that we want to get developer signals. I didn’t mean to make a bigger point than that.

but... do they retain rights to have that messing-with be respected by iteration? I'd say no

[12:07:24.0555] <littledan>
the extra work that engines would have to do would be to retain those rights. and that's not trivial.

[12:11:38.0414] <rbuckton>
I wonder if we could freeze array iterator instances and make `%AIP%. next` non-writable, non-configurable

[12:17:02.0298] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> but... do they retain rights to have that messing-with be respected by iteration? I'd say no

I mean we'd be changing the semantics. If someone overwrites `%ArrayIteratorPrototype%.next` to observe every array iteration, I think it's their expectation it'd work given how we currently specified it. Would that break someone is another question. So yeah I suppose that is where you need a normative / observable change if that's something you want to stop supporting.

[12:18:31.0941] <Mathieu Hofman>
Of course frozen intrinsics would solve all this mess ;) Once the environment is locked down, your optimizer would know what it can permanently rely on or not.

yeah, this is an observable change, the question is whether this would break any actual reasonable and widely-deployed program. We don't give people the ability to observe object destructuring, and we shouldn't add that; this is more of an accidental capability IMO.

[12:21:27.0363] <littledan>
> <@mhofman:matrix.org> Of course frozen intrinsics would solve all this mess ;) Once the environment is locked down, your optimizer would know what it can permanently rely on or not.

we are not operating in a frozen intrinsics world; even if we're there sometimes, we need extractors to be reasonably efficient outside of that.

[12:23:22.0312] <Mathieu Hofman>
But it'd be such a nice carrot for the environment to move to frozen intrinsics if there was a perf benefit to gain from it.

[12:24:02.0282] <littledan>
that doesn't seem like a great reason by itself to not do this sort of integrity enhancement for array iteration (or just destructuring) if it's otherwise web-compatible.

[13:42:37.0614] <Mathieu Hofman>
Oh sure one doesn't prevent the other. But in general, I would be hopeful that frozen object and frozen intrinsics should allow engines to do some optimizations instead of making things slower (as it seems to be the case currently). We hear stories of people liking hardened environments but being unhappy with the performance impact, which is a blocker for adoption in production.

Do you know of any concrete cases where frozen objects are slower than u frozen objects in V8? We investigated this 3 years ago and found nothing useful. Links to bugs or repros would be useful.

here's a rather stark example:
```
const unfrozen = Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, i) => i);
const frozen = Object.freeze([...unfrozen]);
fn = arr => arr.slice().concat("FIN");
let result;

result = fn(unfrozen); // 10.787 ops/ms
result = fn(frozen); // 1.427 ops/ms
```

I try to. I went last year, but this year, it was sandwiched between a bunch of other travel and I couldn't reasonably make it work. Have to be home some time. Easily the best academic conference of the year though.
