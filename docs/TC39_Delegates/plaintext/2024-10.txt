I really hope over time the spec is allowed to change the number of ticks some things take. I believe we did so for async function return already

[21:41:49.0861] <rkirsling>
shu: did you mean to leave this needs-consensus topic just titled by its number on the agenda? ü§î

copypasting Rob's message from the reflector:

[13:44:48.0527] <Chris de Almeida>
The agenda continues to fill with content and is beyond our capacity. There's roughly 20 hours of agenda content and 16 hours of meeting time to fit it in. So we are over budget by about 4 hours. Sometimes we recover an hour or two, but not four.

## Actions

### More Time

Our hosts are happy for us to continue until 5pm each day, so I propose we extend Thursday to finish at 5pm instead of finishing at 4pm.

### Less Content

To everyone that has placed items on the agenda, please consider voluntary actions to mitigate the capacity problem. For example you could:

- Mark your item as low priority by adding a ‚¨áÔ∏è icon to the agenda.
  - This means we will only get to it if time permits.
- Reduce the timebox.
  - You can express the timebox as a range if you wish. The upper limit of which should ideally not be higher than the original request.
- Remove the item entirely if there is no harm deferring it to the next meeting which is at the start of December.

[15:27:17.0123] <Michael Ficarra>
alright I added lower bounds to my items' timeboxes, hope that helps with scheduling

Rob Palmer: the notes signup link mentions speech-to-google-docs; is that a leftover from before the transcriptionist?

[17:43:37.0702] <bakkot>
I do still have the bot but haven't been running it

[23:37:25.0606] <Michael Ficarra>
you should run it so we can refer to it while editing

[23:37:32.0343] <Michael Ficarra>
I find it very useful

[00:45:04.0981] <Rob Palmer>

[15:28:46.0536] <Rezvan>
Or it is posted somewhere and I am missing it?

It will be posted an hour ahead of the meeting starting.

The Teams call is up! Please rember to NOT sign into Teams itself. Join the call as a guest.

[18:27:21.0381] <littledan>
We have 4 slots for non-ordinary members in ExeCom

[18:27:42.0569] <littledan>
there are more slots than current members. I encourage everyone to join!

[18:32:13.0120] <shu>
Chris de Almeida: the wintercg vote

[18:34:14.0911] <Chris de Almeida>
shu: maybe DE can elaborate, but my understanding is that they are going to fully move to Ecma, rather than have the split of the CG vs WG

[18:34:38.0630] <Chris de Almeida>
the IPR concerns were due to doing some things in w3c and then some things in ecma and that was problematic

[18:34:57.0430] <shu>
last time that move was voted on and the vote failed due to IPR concerns. i am asking a clarification on what has changed since then

[18:35:08.0329] <shu>
because what i hear internally is "it's pending legal review", and aki's presentation makes it sound like it's a done thing

[18:35:10.0815] <canadahonk>
I can talk on this if people want

[18:35:32.0586] <canadahonk>
> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> shu: maybe DE can elaborate, but my understanding is that they are going to fully move to Ecma, rather than have the split of the CG vs WG

but this is the tl;dr yeah

[18:36:10.0733] <littledan>
If you're interested in the founding documents, please let me know and I'll send them to you. I've already sent to Chris Wilson and Tantek Celik, in addition to the Ecma ExeCom.

[18:36:40.0005] <shu>
specifically i'm wondering are you doing the thing where you're sending all the contributors IP transfer documents or whatever

[18:36:59.0953] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> specifically i'm wondering are you doing the thing where you're sending all the contributors IP transfer documents or whatever

yes, and this is OK since it's a one-time thing rather than an ongoing operation

[18:37:12.0198] <shu>
is that thign pending legal review from the original folks who raised the IP concerns

[18:38:33.0123] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> is that thign pending legal review from the original folks who raised the IP concerns

I don't know who it's pending legal review from. The people who raised concerns previously who I've been able to follow up with were positive about this version. I haven't been able to follow up with everyone.

[18:40:04.0866] <shu>
i'm assuming at least mozilla and google legal
