I really hope over time the spec is allowed to change the number of ticks some things take. I believe we did so for async function return already

[21:41:49.0861] <rkirsling>
shu: did you mean to leave this needs-consensus topic just titled by its number on the agenda? ü§î

[22:31:23.0839] <rkirsling>
nice work dminor 

[01:13:35.0007] <rkirsling>
and shu's presentation is totally gonna be a show-stealer, I'm excited for this üòÅ

[13:44:09.0692] <Chris de Almeida>
copypasting Rob's message from the reflector:

[13:44:48.0527] <Chris de Almeida>
The agenda continues to fill with content and is beyond our capacity. There's roughly 20 hours of agenda content and 16 hours of meeting time to fit it in. So we are over budget by about 4 hours. Sometimes we recover an hour or two, but not four.

## Actions

### More Time

Our hosts are happy for us to continue until 5pm each day, so I propose we extend Thursday to finish at 5pm instead of finishing at 4pm.

### Less Content

To everyone that has placed items on the agenda, please consider voluntary actions to mitigate the capacity problem. For example you could:

- Mark your item as low priority by adding a ‚¨áÔ∏è icon to the agenda.
  - This means we will only get to it if time permits.
- Reduce the timebox.
  - You can express the timebox as a range if you wish. The upper limit of which should ideally not be higher than the original request.
- Remove the item entirely if there is no harm deferring it to the next meeting which is at the start of December.

[15:27:17.0123] <Michael Ficarra>
alright I added lower bounds to my items' timeboxes, hope that helps with scheduling

The Teams call is up! Please rember to NOT sign into Teams itself. Join the call as a guest.

[18:27:21.0381] <littledan>
We have 4 slots for non-ordinary members in ExeCom

[18:27:42.0569] <littledan>
there are more slots than current members. I encourage everyone to join!

[18:32:13.0120] <shu>
Chris de Almeida: the wintercg vote

[18:34:14.0911] <Chris de Almeida>
shu: maybe DE can elaborate, but my understanding is that they are going to fully move to Ecma, rather than have the split of the CG vs WG

[18:34:38.0630] <Chris de Almeida>
the IPR concerns were due to doing some things in w3c and then some things in ecma and that was problematic

[18:34:57.0430] <shu>
last time that move was voted on and the vote failed due to IPR concerns. i am asking a clarification on what has changed since then

[18:35:08.0329] <shu>
because what i hear internally is "it's pending legal review", and aki's presentation makes it sound like it's a done thing

[18:35:10.0815] <canadahonk>
I can talk on this if people want

[18:35:32.0586] <canadahonk>
> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> shu: maybe DE can elaborate, but my understanding is that they are going to fully move to Ecma, rather than have the split of the CG vs WG

but this is the tl;dr yeah

[18:36:10.0733] <littledan>
If you're interested in the founding documents, please let me know and I'll send them to you. I've already sent to Chris Wilson and Tantek Celik, in addition to the Ecma ExeCom.

[18:36:40.0005] <shu>
specifically i'm wondering are you doing the thing where you're sending all the contributors IP transfer documents or whatever

[18:36:59.0953] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> specifically i'm wondering are you doing the thing where you're sending all the contributors IP transfer documents or whatever

yes, and this is OK since it's a one-time thing rather than an ongoing operation

[18:37:12.0198] <shu>
is that thign pending legal review from the original folks who raised the IP concerns

[18:38:33.0123] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> is that thign pending legal review from the original folks who raised the IP concerns

I don't know who it's pending legal review from. The people who raised concerns previously who I've been able to follow up with were positive about this version. I haven't been able to follow up with everyone.

[18:40:04.0866] <shu>
i'm assuming at least mozilla and google legal

[18:43:04.0757] <bakkot>
fwiw the audio sounds fine on the call

[18:45:57.0350] <Aki>
Someone wanna drop that screenshot of TCQ questions for me so I can answer them here?

[18:46:20.0301] <Chris de Almeida>
we shouldn't paste here

[18:46:23.0512] <shu>
(mine was answered in the chat just now)

[18:47:11.0163] <canadahonk>
> <@akirose:matrix.org> Someone wanna drop that screenshot of TCQ questions for me so I can answer them here?

I don't think there was anything else not already answered here (just re tc55 original proposal ipr things)

[18:47:58.0417] <Aki>
Chris de Almeida sent me the screenshot (thanks!)

[18:48:13.0405] <Ashley Claymore>
Ben: when you get a chance could you add a slides link to the agenda

[18:48:23.0462] <Ben>
Doing now

[18:48:39.0665] <littledan>
suggestion for Mozilla's concerns about being able to review the agenda: We require all agenda items to be added before the deadline, unless there is a particular "emergency"/reason for why the addition was delayed. We strongly encourage slides, repos or other supporting materials to be added to the agenda before the deadline or soon after it, with their contents done as early as possible.

[18:56:37.0462] <yulia>
the suggestions dan made above (slides & content must be available) makes a lot of sense. I would also suggest (to avoid issues in the future) that we move the deadline to 14 days (in line with ecma), and we have an indication of the amount of work (in hours) so far added to the meeting. We can't approve what we don't review, and we want to make sure that the output of tc39 is as high as possible. I think that is a shared goal. If we can plan our meeting a bit better I think it would help. 

[18:57:06.0918] <yulia>
I am not sure if many delegates are reviewing all proposal before the meeting, but it is a requirement for us as implementers, because if something lands and we didn't really think about it -- we are left holding the bag

[18:57:40.0756] <Chris de Almeida>
Ecma rules say 21 days

[18:57:45.0205] <ljharb>
fwiw those suggestions are already the case. supporting materials that aren't in by the deadline allows prodecural blocking

[18:57:46.0944] <yulia>
ah my mistake

[18:57:50.0440] <ljharb>
 * fwiw those suggestions are already the case. supporting materials that aren't in by the deadline allows procedural blocking

[18:58:04.0285] <ljharb>
 * fwiw those suggestions are already the case. supporting materials that aren't in by the deadline allows for procedural blocking

[18:58:20.0553] <littledan>
we've confirmed with Ecma in the past that TC39 may adopt its own deadline (otherwise I would've worked on getting the rules changed). But 14 days seems reasonable to me.

[18:58:22.0130] <shu>
at least for proposals 2.7+ i think an earlier deadline makes sense

[18:58:28.0969] <Aki>
yeah i was having a conversation the other day about this and surprised to discover TC39's deadline was different from Ecma's, i totally forgot

[18:58:31.0934] <yulia>
the current 5 working days that we have to fully review all of the proposals was not enough

[18:58:32.0267] <ljharb>
i'm not sure how we could calculate how much review work is needed, because it won't correlate with timebox time

[18:59:18.0434] <ljharb>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> at least for proposals 2.7+ i think an earlier deadline makes sense

i'd assume the largest review is needed for a stage 2 advancement, and the smallest for a stage 0 ‚Üí 1 or 2.7 ‚Üí 3 or 3 ‚Üí 4

[18:59:33.0328] <ljharb>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> at least for proposals 2.7+ i think an earlier deadline makes sense

 * i'd assume the largest review is needed for 1 ‚Üí 2 or 2 ‚Üí 2.7, and the smallest for a stage 0 ‚Üí 1 or 2.7 ‚Üí 3 or 3 ‚Üí 4

[19:00:00.0430] <shu>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> i'd assume the largest review is needed for 1 ‚Üí 2 or 2 ‚Üí 2.7, and the smallest for a stage 0 ‚Üí 1 or 2.7 ‚Üí 3 or 3 ‚Üí 4

the 2->2.7 is the biggest one IMO, because that's starting to approach the "impls left holding the bag in case of things missed during review"

[19:00:16.0250] <shu>
so at least in terms of irreversible consequences

[19:00:26.0603] <yulia>
yeah 2->2.7 is the biggest, that means that things that are not that, end up getting the short end of the stick

[19:00:26.0967] <ljharb>
so given that, requiring an earlier deadline for attempting to enter 2 or 2.7 might make sense

[19:00:37.0776] <bakkot>
fwiw I also did not notice that the agenda item contained "TG4: Source Map Specification, 2024 edition approval (30m, Jonathan Kuperman)"

[19:00:39.0185] <ljharb>
 * so given that, requiring an earlier deadline for attempting to enter 2 or 2.7 might make sense (no need to require it for the others)

[19:00:47.0641] <bakkot>
mostly because I do not look at the task group updates section

[19:00:48.0049] <Chris de Almeida>
I don't have strong feelings on this but I do not want a complex rules engine for which deadlines apply to which stages

[19:01:05.0947] <yulia>
same, i would say just an earlier deadline allowing more than 5 days of review time

[19:01:10.0217] <shu>
then we probably do want to move the deadline up earlier for all proposals

[19:01:17.0648] <littledan>
> <@softwarechris:matrix.org> I don't have strong feelings on this but I do not want a complex rules engine for which deadlines apply to which stages

I agree, I'd prefer to have a single deadline to apply to all agenda items, not just advancement requests

[19:01:35.0666] <Chris de Almeida>
+1

[19:01:37.0222] <ljharb>
we have never had a deadline for non-advancements and i don't think we should start now

[19:01:50.0487] <yulia>
i believe we are only discussing advancement deadlines

[19:02:04.0364] <Chris de Almeida>
I think it would remain a 'best effort' thing, not a 'you missed the boat, sorry' thing

[19:02:19.0777] <ljharb>
the word "deadline" refers to the latter ime

[19:02:30.0323] <Chris de Almeida>
but it's very helpful if everything is in before the given date

[19:02:33.0239] <ljharb>
 * the word "deadline" refers to the latter ime ("dead" being a somewhat final state)

[19:02:34.0472] <littledan>
well, I raised non-advancement-requests, but I can accept if we don't adopt the policy that I suggested

[19:02:41.0892] <Chris de Almeida>
and the later things get added, the more problems it creates

[19:02:55.0388] <yulia>
yeah, with the risk of something beling blocked -- i mean it would be the same situation as now, but with 2 weeks (10 days of working time, if there are no holidays) would go a long way here 

[19:03:20.0286] <littledan>
adding something to the TC39 agenda is asking everyone to take time to focus together on a topic, so I think it's not too much for it to apply to everything. It will help us to be more effective if we have all supporting materials for all items ahead of a deadline.

[19:03:21.0926] <ljharb>
part of the reason we wanted to keep the deadline short in the past is that there's only 2 months between plenaries

[19:03:42.0781] <ljharb>
those extra 4 days have been very helpful in the past to get ducks in a row for an upcoming plenary

[19:07:04.0495] <yulia>
That said, since we meet so frequently, spilling over to the next meeting isn't a huge delay.

[19:07:18.0080] <rkirsling>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> fwiw I also did not notice that the agenda item contained "TG4: Source Map Specification, 2024 edition approval (30m, Jonathan Kuperman)"

I am actually confused whether this is the appropriate timing for a topic of this nature

[19:07:30.0343] <ljharb>
2 months is a significant delay, but 4 days doesn't seem like one to me

[19:07:31.0796] <rkirsling>
like, 30m topic in the 5m topics section

[19:07:48.0632] <Ashley Claymore>
Current doc for advancement to Stage 1 says:

> Such proposals must link to a proposal repository and they *should* link to supporting materials when possible.

[19:07:56.0985] <yulia>
the time taken in those 4 days, vs incomplete review and missing something, the cost of the latter is much higher

[19:08:10.0559] <Ashley Claymore>
maybe we should make that should a must

[19:08:17.0677] <littledan>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> those extra 4 days have been very helpful in the past to get ducks in a row for an upcoming plenary

I think that logic made sense at the time, but as the committee grew and we got more topics on the agenda, the tradeoff shifts, as yulia says

[19:08:45.0733] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm not following the chat,   but if it's for source map: it would be a 6 months delay and not 2 months, due to the GA meeting twice per year

[19:08:53.0119] <rkirsling>
> <@aclaymore:matrix.org> maybe we should make that should a must

I feel like I remember having a conversation in which I suggested this and we landed on "should" instead somehow...or something

[19:08:57.0831] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@aclaymore:matrix.org> maybe we should make that should a must

I think it's fine to have reduced requirements for Stage 1

[19:09:42.0954] <Aki>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> I'm not following the chat,   but if it's for source map: it would be a 6 months delay and not 2 months, due to the GA meeting twice per year

Two months here refers to stage advancement

[19:10:19.0447] <littledan>
overall, the wording in the agenda doc has encouraged people to not bother to especially try to get things into the agenda ahead of time, even when they maybe could've. It's been confusing for me to explain to people that they really should put everything there earlier, and I've had to clarify that lots of times.

[19:10:25.0143] <nicolo-ribaudo>
littledan Btw, the reason we were thinking about the license for the spec itself, is that both ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 are published underm Ecma's BSD version

 * littledan Btw, the reason we were thinking about the license for the spec itself, is that both ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 are published under Ecma's BSD version

> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> littledan Btw, the reason we were thinking about the license for the spec itself, is that both ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 are published under Ecma's BSD version

Ecma has one BSD version for test262 at https://ecma-international.org/policies/by-ipr/ecma-international-policy-on-submission-inclusion-and-licensing-of-software/ ; the alternative copyright notice at https://ecma-international.org/policies/by-ipr/ecma-text-copyright-policy/ (second section) seems broadly BSD-like, but somewhat different text, which is why I was confused. I imagine you're working on the latter relicensing (I don't really understand why it's not implicit based on Google+Mozilla's agreements with Ecma, but the lawyers will known better)

[19:16:42.0832] <Chengzhong Wu>
do we have a slides link to TG5 Report?

[19:17:46.0233] <yulia>

[19:18:44.0351] <littledan>

[19:18:49.0702] <bakkot>
yes

[19:23:12.0241] <bakkot>
I strongly agree with Michael's point that we should never switch on iterability for any reason other than to throw for non-iterables

[19:23:14.0180] <rbuckton>
auto-wrapping is a footgun that required a special symbol to workaround for Array.prototype.concat. We shouldn't repeat that mistake

[19:24:40.0979] <ljharb>
that isn't why isConcatSpreadable exists, it exists so DOM NodeLists can explain their special array concat behavior

[19:25:21.0576] <keith_miller>
I thought isConcatSpreadable existed to make me suffer as a new hire :P

[19:25:26.0473] <ljharb>
iow that symbol is not relevant to this proposal.

[19:25:33.0673] <ljharb>
 * iow that symbol is not relevant to this proposal, whether it autowraps or not

[19:25:33.0795] <rbuckton>
It also likely wouldn't have been necessary if Array.prototype.concat did not have the auto-wrapping behavior

[19:25:38.0117] <ljharb>
that too!

[19:25:49.0124] <ljharb>
someone made sure that "make keith suffer" was redacted from the notes

[19:25:59.0579] <ljharb>
it would still have been necessary.

[19:26:07.0371] <ljharb>
because NodeLists aren't arrays and did have special concat behavior

[19:26:24.0609] <ljharb>
without the autowrapping, NodeLists would have thrown instead of spread

[19:26:42.0797] <ljharb>
 * without the autowrapping, NodeLists would have thrown instead of been added without spreading

[19:26:47.0235] <rbuckton>
Either way, auto-wrapping is a footgun. it also doesn't align with our recent decision to cut back on coercing things

[19:26:50.0862] <ljharb>
but NodeLists spread, thus the symbol. nothing to do with autowrapping whatsoever.

[19:27:27.0155] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
What's the special behavior of NodeList?

[19:29:21.0206] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> Either way, auto-wrapping is a footgun. it also doesn't align with our recent decision to cut back on coercing things

I guess the behavior of Array.p.concat is come from perl. Though perl have the sigil to indicate whether it's a scalar or list.

[19:32:15.0618] <nicolo-ribaudo>
As a committee, we should adopt the principle of "making it hard to accidentally do the wrong thing". When user intention is ambiguous, let's ask users to be explicit 

[19:33:35.0997] <littledan>
In TC39, the bare minimum is "web compatibility", which is a much weaker property than "breaking change". As Jordan explained, basically anything that we do can be considered breaking.

[19:36:58.0384] <Bradford Smith>
Iterable helpers that flatten their arguments are implicitly branching on iterability and likely to be used a lot in future.

[19:38:54.0648] <bakkot>
which iterable helpers flatten their arguments?

[19:39:22.0399] <Bradford Smith>
Maybe my memory is faulty. I thought there was at least one API that did this.

[19:39:29.0177] <rbuckton>
IIRC, `Iterator.prototype.flatMap` does not coerce non-iterator/non-iterable

[19:39:48.0947] <bakkot>
it rejects non-iterators

[19:40:42.0093] <rbuckton>
If you consider `Iterator.concat` to essentially be `(...args) => args.values().flatMap(x => x)`, then we should also throw for non-iterators

[19:41:00.0413] <ljharb>
in general as well, something being iterable is a massively impactful "trait" of it - something changing from being "a thing" to being "a container of things" isn't and shouldn't be a common thing. if we're talking about good API design, good API design wouldn't make this change, i'd think

[19:41:08.0775] <ljharb>

> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> If you consider `Iterator.concat` to essentially be `(...args) => args.values().flatMap(x => x)`, then we should also throw for non-iterators

to be really explicit, this proposal only accepts _iterables_, not iterators

[19:42:24.0171] <bakkot>
accepting _iterators_ turns out to get really awkward

[19:42:32.0129] <bakkot>
because you have to take responsibility for closing them

[19:44:31.0666] <rbuckton>
I'm not saying it must be implemented as such, but a naive implementation using `flatMap` would throw, not coerce.

that naive implementation would eagerly exhaust the iterators, which this doesn't do

[19:45:37.0995] <rbuckton>
Again, I'm talking about consistency. `Iterator` generally doesn't coerce

[19:46:29.0463] <ljharb>
true, that's what `Iterator.from` is for

[19:46:30.0775] <rbuckton>
I'm not concerned, there are plenty of bad API designs on Array we shouldn't carry forward, even if we carry forward the concept to other APIs

@ljharb:matrix.org very weakly yes, but I got over it quickly in Rust

[19:47:21.0900] <Justin Ridgewell>
Used a whole bunch of `once(foo)`, but it‚Äôs much easier in JS because you can wrap in an array without screwing with types.

[19:47:24.0273] <rbuckton>
For instance, iterator helper methods don't take a `thisArg` despite the array prototype methods of the same name doing so.

[19:49:05.0022] <ljharb>
sure, but array concat's behavior isn't bad.

Yes that was the primary use case, but people then tried to think about how to use this for static analysis (basically exposing the metadata that the engine already has to collect)

erights: As stated on a previous slide, there is no return override capability.

[21:33:35.0054] <Mathieu Hofman>
rbuckton: I think Mark's question (who isn't on Matrix) is whether a class can use a struct as the returned object in a return override to stamp fields on the struct

[21:33:50.0500] <rbuckton>
Ah. No, it cannot

[21:33:53.0958] <ljharb>
why not?

[21:33:58.0712] <ljharb>
if it's an object it should work

[21:34:08.0653] <ljharb>
just as if i can weakly hold it

[21:34:11.0135] <Mathieu Hofman>
I mean I'd love that, but yes, why, what's the mechanism ?

[21:34:30.0554] <ljharb>
it's an object. all objects (except `window`) can have fields stamped on them via return override.

[21:34:31.0373] <rbuckton>
No, the fields must be statically known at construction time for one-shot initialization

[21:34:49.0349] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> if it's an object it should work

I am very against this line of logic. A WeakMap capability should not be syntactic

[21:34:59.0328] <ljharb>
"adding a private field" is the same as "putting an object in a weakmap"

[21:35:04.0814] <ljharb>
that's explicitly how private fields were designed

[21:35:14.0752] <ljharb>
return override isn't syntactic

[21:35:49.0701] <ljharb>
it is currently an invariant that if it is an object (modulo window) you can stamp private fields onto it via return override. we shouldn't break that invariant.

[21:35:56.0604] <Mathieu Hofman>
return override + private field stamping is a syntactic capability that is not deniable or virtualizable, unlike WeakMap

[21:35:58.0027] <ljharb>
 * it is currently an invariant that if it is an object (modulo window) you can stamp private fields onto it via return override, and hold it weakly. we shouldn't break that invariant.

[21:36:10.0205] <ljharb>
that's already the case for all objects, it's a consequence of being an object.

[21:36:19.0551] <rbuckton>
private fields, if/when supported, will also have a fixed layout.

[21:36:21.0975] <Mathieu Hofman>
and it was a huge mistake

[21:36:30.0905] <Mathieu Hofman>
and I strongly believe we should not hold this as an invariant

[21:36:33.0018] <ljharb>
doesn't mean we should create inconsistency by deviating from it

[21:36:44.0329] <rbuckton>
it is necessary to achieve the performance characteristics we want for structs/shared structs

[21:36:50.0294] <ljharb>
to me this is an obstacle to stage 2, to be clear.

[21:37:09.0342] <bakkot>
can you `class extends Struct {}`? if so you can surely put a private filed in that class?

[21:37:13.0629] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> private fields, if/when supported, will also have a fixed layout.

The fixed layout is so that struct methods can "quickly" access them, right? Those installed via return override would not be private fields that belong to the struct, so they wouldn't go through that fast path

[21:39:44.0433] <rbuckton>
Yes and no. The fixed layout is partially so that implementations can properly optimize field accesses in ways that they cannot with normal fields today. For shared structs, we want private fields to be shared memory as well

[21:39:52.0464] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> can you `class extends Struct {}`? if so you can surely put a private filed in that class?

That is technically not necessary for for stamping private field

[21:40:08.0158] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> can you `class extends Struct {}`? if so you can surely put a private filed in that class?

 * That is technically not necessary for for stamping private fields

[21:40:43.0363] <bakkot>
right but... can you do that thing?

[21:45:55.0171] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> can you `class extends Struct {}`? if so you can surely put a private filed in that class?

We could possibly allow this by storing the private fields of a struct/shared struct differently than those added by a class, where private fields added by a class are more weakmap like, while those added by a shared struct maintain fixed layout to be portable across agents.

[21:46:39.0867] <ljharb>
that sounds like the only option to resolve it tbh

[21:46:45.0060] <bakkot>
I am OK with it being impossible to `class extends Struct {}`, to be clear

[21:46:51.0233] <bakkot>
just asking if that would work

[21:47:06.0773] <ljharb>
i'm not ok with being unable to stamp fields onto it.

[21:47:29.0357] <rbuckton>
I'd be fine `class extends struct` not working

[21:47:45.0753] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
As the current proposal, struct seems like a weakened version of class. Perceptually, the difference between struct and class is much smaller than the difference between struct and shared struct. I mean, it seems easy to rewrite a class to struct, but very hard to modify a struct to become a shared struct. This make me feel weird that "struct" and "shared struct" use similar name and syntax...

[21:48:37.0707] <bakkot>
if (and only if) it is impossible to `class extends Struct {}` then I am also ok with the return-override trick not allowing you to return a struct

[21:48:49.0891] <bakkot>
in which case, as a consequence, you could not stamp additional private fields on an existing struct

[21:49:17.0450] <littledan>
Correlation is also important even if you just have one object, and want the methods to work after sharing it to the other side

[21:51:06.0851] <rbuckton>
`struct` is a restricted form of `class`, partly because `class` polymorphism is expensive and slow and cannot be fully optimized via ICs. the fixed layout of structs is partly intended to improve performance due to the well known layout. Basically: `class` is more flexible but slower, `struct` is more restrictive but faster.

did I blink and miss an explanation of function coloring

[21:55:12.0838] <rbuckton>
> <@rkirsling:matrix.org> did I blink and miss an explanation of function coloring

Function coloring is a function being aware of whether it is invoked inside of an `unsafe` block. 

[21:55:16.0574] <rkirsling>
I _think_ I understand what it means (like "an async function is fundamentally different from a sync function") but I don't see what shu is saying

we should add that to the glossary

[21:55:59.0607] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
rbuckton: Yeah, I mean it seems we should use syntax like ` sealed class { } ` to make it clear (though `sealed` is not a correct keyword) that it's a better but restricted class. And let shared struct just use `struct {}` ...

[21:56:02.0616] <ljharb>
the queue has 13 items btw

[21:56:10.0041] <danielrosenwasser>
Basically if you have a function `f` that contains an `unsafe {}` block, callers of `f` don't need to wrap it in an `unsafe {}` block.

[21:56:20.0988] <danielrosenwasser>
 * Basically if you have a function `foo` that contains an `unsafe {}` block, callers of `foo` don't need to wrap it in an `unsafe {}` block.

Shu and the v8 team have other reasons to want `struct`, including the unique construction semantics. struct and shared struct construction differs significantly from `class`.

With function coloring, yes. As specified, no and we do not think it should be added.

[21:57:22.0508] <ljharb>
gotcha thanks

[21:57:23.0833] <danielrosenwasser>

[21:57:28.0642] <Mathieu Hofman>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> so i'd be able to write an "am i in an unsafe block" predicate?

as a property access on a proxy, maybe, depending on the open question

[21:57:42.0973] <Mathieu Hofman>
but as a predicate that has the shape of a function, no

[21:57:58.0469] <ljharb>
if you can't write such a predicate i'm not sure how you could virtualize shared structs

[21:58:34.0055] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> Shu and the v8 team have other reasons to want `struct`, including the unique construction semantics. struct and shared struct construction differs significantly from `class`.

I understand from the engine viewpoint (or spec viewpoint) it's true, but I guess from developer concept model, it's too different.

[21:58:34.0112] <Mathieu Hofman>
you can with proxy

[21:58:42.0819] <ljharb>

[21:59:58.0114] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> so i'd be able to write an "am i in an unsafe block" predicate?

You can try/catch around reading from a shared struct that you have, right?

```js
shared struct Test { x }

{
  try { new Test().x } catch { console.log("not unsafe block") }
}

unsafe {
  try { new Test().x; console.log("unsafe block") } catch { }
}
```

[22:00:01.0225] <rbuckton>
> <@haxjs:matrix.org> I understand from the engine viewpoint (or spec viewpoint) it's true, but I guess from developer concept model, it's too different.

Even from a developer point of view, the construction semantics of a `struct` differ enough from `class` that making it differ purely based on a modifier would trip up developers.

ok, but can i run that try/catch inside a function that someone else invokes in, or not in, an unsafe block?

[22:00:29.0272] <danielrosenwasser>
ah I've misunderstood - so is the following disallowed?

```
function foo() {
    unsafe {
        bar();
    }
}

function bar(sharedInstance) {
    sharedInstance.property = 123;
}
```

> <@ljharb:matrix.org> ok, but can i run that try/catch inside a function that someone else invokes in, or not in, an unsafe block?

No, but that function's body is always running in "safe" mode

[22:00:49.0310] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It's like checking if your caller is strict or loose

Yes, this does not work.

I would like to see a lot more examples what code is/is not legal `using`, somewhere

[22:01:10.0568] <bakkot>
it is probably good I just don't understand it yet

[22:01:11.0335] <rbuckton>
`bar` does not magically get colored as `unsafe` when called. it must be lexically scoped within the block.

[22:01:22.0193] <rbuckton>
`using` or `unsafe`?

[22:01:23.0513] <bakkot>
 * I would like to see a lot more examples what code is/is not legal for `unsafe`, somewhere

[22:01:26.0602] <bakkot>
`unsafe`, sorry

[22:02:01.0549] <rbuckton>
`unsafe` only controls the ability to get/set a field on a shared struct instance, and only applies to code lexically scoped within the `unsafe {}` block.

[22:02:30.0989] <bakkot>
ok, that sounds straightforward; I think I got confused by all the discussion of coloring

[22:02:31.0568] <Mathieu Hofman>
`unsafe` only changes the behavior of get/set lexically contained in the block.

[22:02:43.0990] <bakkot>
but I am confused about the discussion of the APIs, then

[22:02:50.0764] <bakkot>
like `Reflect.get` etc

[22:03:20.0858] <Mathieu Hofman>
Should `Reflect.get` have some way to access the value (regardless of where the call happens)

[22:03:26.0756] <rbuckton>
The problem with `Reflect.get` is that it either must always succeed or always throw when reading a shared struct field.

[22:03:59.0156] <bakkot>
or we thread a parameter about unsafe-ness through, per the slides

[22:04:05.0247] <rbuckton>
Which means a Proxy must also either always succeed or always fail, or passing a get through a proxy trap becomes inconsistent when it passes through Reflect.get.

[22:04:10.0747] <rbuckton>
Yes, that's the third option.

[22:04:54.0371] <Mathieu Hofman>
get/set behavior is pretty straightforward. Where it gets funky is with own prop MOPs

[22:05:22.0334] <rbuckton>
My point is more that Reflect.get cannot magically know its in an `unsafe` block

[22:05:36.0186] <bakkot>
ack

[22:06:09.0943] <rbuckton>
It either must always succeed, always fail, or be explicitly informed via a parameter.
