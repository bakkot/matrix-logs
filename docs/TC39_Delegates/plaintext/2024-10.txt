I really hope over time the spec is allowed to change the number of ticks some things take. I believe we did so for async function return already

copypasting Rob's message from the reflector:

[13:44:48.0527] <Chris de Almeida>
The agenda continues to fill with content and is beyond our capacity. There's roughly 20 hours of agenda content and 16 hours of meeting time to fit it in. So we are over budget by about 4 hours. Sometimes we recover an hour or two, but not four.

## Actions

### More Time

Our hosts are happy for us to continue until 5pm each day, so I propose we extend Thursday to finish at 5pm instead of finishing at 4pm.

### Less Content

To everyone that has placed items on the agenda, please consider voluntary actions to mitigate the capacity problem. For example you could:

- Mark your item as low priority by adding a ‚¨áÔ∏è icon to the agenda.
  - This means we will only get to it if time permits.
- Reduce the timebox.
  - You can express the timebox as a range if you wish. The upper limit of which should ideally not be higher than the original request.
- Remove the item entirely if there is no harm deferring it to the next meeting which is at the start of December.
