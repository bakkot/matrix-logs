Draft Schedule is up on the Reflector: https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/545

[08:58:29.0533] <Rob Palmer>
The meeting begins in 1 minute!!!

[09:00:49.0545] <Michael Ficarra>
FYI we still don't have a TCQ link

If Google meet is stuck on "Getting ready... You'll be able to join in just a moment", is it a problem on my side?

[09:03:39.0836] <ljharb>
probably, there's a bunch of us in it

[09:04:10.0051] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Ok thanks, time to restart everything

[09:12:48.0157] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Chairs, last minute change. It seems like I will be the one presenting the TG4 status report

[09:40:01.0142] <littledan>
I like Saminaâ€™s idea to have a liaison from TC39 to IETF, analogous to our close relationship with W3C and Unicode. Is anyone interested in playing this role?

[09:45:32.0045] <saminahusain>
In the past, I think 2021, Mathew Miller was the liaison contact from  tc39

[09:49:54.0455] <bakkot>
sorry, I forgot to add to the agenda constraints that I'm not available the first hour today

[09:50:19.0099] <bakkot>
hope we can get to my iterator closing topic after that

[09:54:17.0645] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Did Chris change which diff he's showing?

[09:54:46.0548] <Michael Ficarra>
yes

[09:57:35.0768] <Michael Ficarra>
whoever is doing notes right now, please refer to https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/delegates.txt for abbreviations, don't just make something up

I always assumed the motivation on this proposal was about ergonomics and not really about performance

There were no slides. The presented material was the readme of the proposal repo.

We don't throw when you mutate a Map while iterating. I'd almost rather `getOrInsertComputed` just overwrites the key, whether it was set or deleted during the callback. If you want full locking, you can implement it yourself?

[10:30:10.0744] <shu>
rbuckton: that IS my understanding of the non-throwing approach

[10:30:11.0704] <shu>
is it not?
