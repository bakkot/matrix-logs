not immediately relevant to JS as a language, but the JS promise integration for wasm is an interesting project worth reading about I think https://v8.dev/blog/jspi

This looks like automatic conditional `await` of exported Wasm functions without user intervention. Meaning the JS caller does not need to be an async function, and calls the Wasm function as if it were sync.

If this is true, does it means that we have solved JS sync functions calling JS async function in a sync manner? Because you just need to insert a thin layer of Wasm between them.
