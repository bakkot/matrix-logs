not immediately relevant to JS as a language, but the JS promise integration for wasm is an interesting project worth reading about I think https://v8.dev/blog/jspi 

[00:02:43.0671] <Rob Palmer>
This looks like automatic conditional `await` of exported Wasm functions without user intervention. Meaning the JS caller does not need to be an async function, and calls the Wasm function as if it were sync.

If this is true, does it means that we have solved JS sync functions calling JS async function in a sync manner? Because you just need to insert a thin layer of Wasm between them.

[00:23:03.0718] <nicolo-ribaudo>
You still need to await the Wasm function on the JS side. It's implicit only on Wasm.

See `promise_update` in https://github.com/WebAssembly/js-promise-integration/blob/main/proposals/js-promise-integration/Overview.md

I was sad to miss Jaakko JÃ¤rvi's talk at the TG5 meeting before Helsinki (https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/528) -- is there any slides/notes from there that I could follow up with? 

[08:21:32.0137] <Michael Ficarra>
@mgaudet:mozilla.org There were slides, and you'd probably be interested in them. You should send an email to his university email (jaakko.jarvi@utu.fi) for them. The notes are... very light: https://github.com/tc39/tg5/pull/10/files

[08:23:29.0456] <mgaudet>
Thank you for the pointers!

Iâ€™ll ask Jaakko to share the slides 

[10:55:10.0315] <mgaudet>
(I sent him an email already too :) ) 

[10:56:48.0345] <Mikhail Barash>

You mean the C++ talk? Or the slides on HotDrink?

[10:56:53.0951] <mgaudet>
the C_

[10:56:58.0528] <mgaudet>
 * the C++ talk

notes were not taken during Jaakko's talk on C++, as that part of the TG5 Workshop wasn't formally under Ecma's IPR policy...
