Happy Monday, delegates! Just a few days before the notes deadline. that means reviewing the transcript of what you said and editing for accuracy, making sure links to proposals and slides are present and accurate, and recording a summary of the presentation/conversation as well as any decisions the committee reached at the conclusion.

RCE in react server apparently arising from proto pollution

gotta start encouraging people to put `delete Object.prototype.__proto__` at the top of all their files I guess

Gotta suggest a CSP to remove it, it's normative optional anyway

https://github.com/tc39/proposal-symbol-proto had something like that, although much more complex

[11:59:38.0328] <bakkot>
though in this case it was server-side

[12:00:17.0121] <bakkot>
(and node _does_ have `--disable-proto`, though no one uses it)

If you could teach them to do this, you could teach them to not use objects as maps. Unfortunately, "we can teach them" as a strategy has never worked out once in my life.

[12:07:35.0842] <bakkot>
one of those things is a lot easier to teach!

[12:08:32.0274] <kriskowal>
yeah, and JSON makes a lie of “don’t use objects for maps” every time.

[12:17:04.0891] <ptomato>
so does the performance of using objects for maps
