Happy Monday, delegates! Just a few days before the notes deadline. that means reviewing the transcript of what you said and editing for accuracy, making sure links to proposals and slides are present and accurate, and recording a summary of the presentation/conversation as well as any decisions the committee reached at the conclusion.

RCE in react server apparently arising from proto pollution

gotta start encouraging people to put `delete Object.prototype.__proto__` at the top of all their files I guess

https://github.com/tc39/proposal-symbol-proto had something like that, although much more complex

[11:59:38.0328] <bakkot>
though in this case it was server-side

(and node _does_ have `--disable-proto`, though no one uses it)
