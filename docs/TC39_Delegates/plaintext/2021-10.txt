Aki: as long as you are doing matrix-y things, can I petition you to change the logs links to https://matrixlogs.bakkot.com/ ? the current logs are kinda garbage

bakkot: can we host that somewhere that's controlled by the committee instead?

[15:39:34.0902] <bakkot>
Michael Ficarra: It's on github pages

[15:39:53.0522] <bakkot>
do you want push access to the repo, or?

[15:40:24.0486] <bakkot>
but also we relied on a logbot hosted by a non-committee member for the last several years, which was fine

[15:40:38.0602] <bakkot>
so it does not seem particularly pressing to me

[15:41:06.0221] <Michael Ficarra>
I meant the domain, shouldn't it be easy to be something like `tc39.es/matrixlogs` by transferring to the tc39 org?

[15:44:53.0165] <bakkot>
I don't intend it to be just for tc39; it also hosts logs for whatwg, and I will probably add more if people ask for them. and I don't really want to run multiple instances of it

[15:45:13.0687] <bakkot>
so if you want to do the work of setting up and running a separate instance and hosting it there, go for it

[15:45:18.0650] <bakkot>
otherwise I would prefer not to change mine
