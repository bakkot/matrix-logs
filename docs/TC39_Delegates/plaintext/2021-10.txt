Aki: as long as you are doing matrix-y things, can I petition you to change the logs links to https://matrixlogs.bakkot.com/ ? the current logs are kinda garbage

bakkot: can we host that somewhere that's controlled by the committee instead?

[15:39:34.0902] <bakkot>
Michael Ficarra: It's on github pages

[15:39:53.0522] <bakkot>
do you want push access to the repo, or?

[15:40:24.0486] <bakkot>
but also we relied on a logbot hosted by a non-committee member for the last several years, which was fine

[15:40:38.0602] <bakkot>
so it does not seem particularly pressing to me

[15:41:06.0221] <Michael Ficarra>
I meant the domain, shouldn't it be easy to be something like `tc39.es/matrixlogs` by transferring to the tc39 org?

[15:44:53.0165] <bakkot>
I don't intend it to be just for tc39; it also hosts logs for whatwg, and I will probably add more if people ask for them. and I don't really want to run multiple instances of it

[15:45:13.0687] <bakkot>
so if you want to do the work of setting up and running a separate instance and hosting it there, go for it

[15:45:18.0650] <bakkot>
otherwise I would prefer not to change mine

it'd probably be good to have tc39's be on their own instance under tc39.es

Several Stage 0 proposals have been transferred to the tc39 GitHub organization. Is there a particular policy about this? https://github.com/tc39/proposals#onboarding-existing-proposals doesnâ€™t talk about Stage 0.

[07:41:46.0463] <ryzokuken>
are internal slots case sensitive?

[07:46:06.0926] <ryzokuken>
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots doesn't specify that

[07:57:51.0448] <shu>
yeah, treat them as case sensitive

[07:58:01.0159] <shu>
i'd be against every introducing slot names that differ only in casing

[07:58:08.0196] <shu>
but even so just treat them as case sensitive

[08:00:30.0551] <ryzokuken>
I mean more about access. Can I access `[[Foo]]` using `[[foo]]`?

[08:11:24.0610] <Ashley Claymore>
semi-related. is the `[[Description]]` that a Symbol "holds" also an 'internal slot'? The spec seems to say that slots are only on objects, so would it be technically incorrect to say that symbols have an internal slot?

[09:02:16.0519] <shu>
ryzokuken: no, use [[Foo]]

[09:42:19.0358] <shu>
Ashley Claymore: not technically, but conceptually yes

[10:01:31.0475] <Ashley Claymore>
thanks shu  ðŸ™‚

PSA: nobody has signed up for the next incubator call yet. the topic is Proxy performance https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/399

the policy is that stage 1+ proposals *must* be transferred; stage 0 proposals can be, but for scalability, we should probably only transfer the ones that have been discussed in a plenary

Can the `Contains` spec op be used with a sequence of terminals, or would I need to contain the terminals in a nonterminal to use Contains? For example, would the following be valid spec text?:
```
If _node_ Contains `using const`, ...
```

rbuckton: as it is currently written, it cannot. it walks over the children of a parse node one at a time checking if each is an instance of the argument to Contains, which would not work when the thing you are looking for is spread out across multiple children.

FYI to CoC people: just sent in a CoC request (in case it gets caught by spam filters like last time)
