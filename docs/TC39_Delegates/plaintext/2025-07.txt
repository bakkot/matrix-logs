I have definitely never heard anyone say the word milliard or billiard though

[20:59:23.0525] <rkirsling>
so I remain feeling like this is just some long troll being played on Americans

webpack merged support for import defer proposal!

[09:11:17.0335] <dminor>
Would someone here have permissions to make mgaudet and I collaborators on https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-capturestacktrace? Neither of us has access to the settings since the transfer to the tc39 org, and I'd like to fix up the deploy of the spec text to gh-pages.

[09:14:08.0533] <Chris de Almeida>
mgaudet has write permission, and now you do as well

[09:14:14.0782] <Chris de Almeida>
* mgaudet already had write permission, and now you do as well

[09:17:45.0633] <dminor>
Thank you, but I'm still not seeing the `settings`, does that require a separate permission?

[09:54:41.0486] <Chris de Almeida>
oh.. yes

[09:55:34.0894] <Chris de Almeida>
try now

[11:13:32.0552] <dminor>
Working now, thank you for the help :)

[13:25:01.0097] <Aki>
Well deserved, both of you

[13:25:30.0524] <Aki>
Can someone point me to the conversation about normatively referencing WebIDL? I'm doing‚Ä¶ research.

[13:31:16.0031] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I think it's most in emails and calls, I'll forward them to you tomorrow 

[13:31:41.0812] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh nevermind I was thinking of infra, not webidl

[13:43:29.0450] <Michael Ficarra>
which conversation? the one from plenary?

[13:44:01.0903] <Aki>
I don't know, I saw it referenced at some point in Matrix. If there was one from the last plenary I can go read the notes!

[13:44:21.0428] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah you can see the notes for that

[13:44:27.0238] <Michael Ficarra>
also there's still conversation happening in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-idl/issues

[14:55:45.0496] <Aki>
do any of the TC39 standards from any TG reference anything published by w3c? (normatively or informatively)(or even in the biblio)

I hadn't realized that when node started doing automatic typescript type stripping they also exposed that functionality as an API

[14:06:56.0378] <bakkot>
that makes it pretty trivial to strip types when serving files

[14:07:32.0998] <bakkot>
which... I think eats most of the motivation for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations ? at least the motivations I was aware of

[14:07:59.0587] <bakkot>
demo https://github.com/bakkot/buildless-ts-webapp


2025-07-07
[09:28:16.0359] <Rob Palmer>
That is a very cool project, bakkot:

It shows how many pieces of the puzzle are coming to allow TS and ESM to be used in a simple way. 

[09:30:02.0612] <ljharb>
it'd be cool to also describe/provide a variant that avoids the speed overhead that takes one of these apps and pre-transpiles it so that it still works

[09:30:21.0592] <Rob Palmer>
On the motivations for type annotations, the Node work demonstrates that runtimes can play a large part in the story of reducing developer friction. Deno/Bun also showed that earlier on. 

[09:31:19.0101] <Rob Palmer>
There are still some remaining gaps, such a browser debugging. Using the console/REPL with TS still isn't as frictionless as using JS. 

[09:32:30.0865] <Rob Palmer>
The other motivation was language coordination. Something Mark raised strongly in Feb 2025 during the post plenary session on type annotations. Monutes are available. 

[09:32:44.0225] <Rob Palmer>
* The other motivation was language coordination. Something Mark raised strongly in Feb 2025 during the post plenary session on type annotations. Minutes are available. 

[09:33:03.0494] <bakkot>
Fair point about language coordination, yeah

[09:33:41.0899] <bakkot>
myself I've always kind of been on the other side of that, because I like it when TS adds good syntax (`satisfies` etc) instead of trying to fit it into a pre-reserved syntax space

[09:34:53.0354] <Rob Palmer>
(Though I see the TS introduction of the new "erasableSyntaxOnly" tsconfig flag + TC39 advancement of the Stage 1 enum proposal as highly positive indications of all sides leaning in to attempts to coordinate already.)

[09:37:05.0424] <bakkot>
I actually have found that debugging ts-blank-space strip'd types is totally frictionless; do you just mean the bit where you can't copy-paste TS code into the repl? I think that would be adequately solved by having Chrome devtools ship swc

[09:48:29.0039] <Rob Palmer>
Yes, I mean copy-pasting into the REPL. And I agree that if we coordinate across the ecosystem to intercept all the places that JS is debugged so they implement these same type-stripping semantics, then from a user's perspective using TS should be pretty much as frictionless as JS.

[09:49:48.0459] <Rob Palmer>
(I.e. Chrome is not the only debugger) 


2025-07-08
[06:55:29.0062] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I wonder if we have a name for documents containing instructions for multiple parties in an ecosystem to coordinate on some shared agreed upon behavior...

[10:20:04.0318] <bakkot>
I definitely do not want typescript to have to go through a standards body to introduce new syntax, that is one of my main goals here

The next TC39 plenary is 28th-31st July.

___Reminder:___ The agenda advancement deadline is [July 18th 10:00 PDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20250718T18&msg=TC39%20Submission%20deadline) which is just over two days away.

Please try to share all materials by this time so folk can carry out their pre-plenary reviews.

[10:04:53.0113] <Michael Ficarra>
does anyone mind if I replace GitHub usernames with real names on the agenda?

[10:05:31.0594] <Michael Ficarra>
it's hard enough remembering everyone's name, affiliation, and TLA, I don't want to also have to remember their GitHub usernames

[10:14:00.0113] <Chris de Almeida>
fine to do it for Ruben, but please reach out to `@styfle` before changing theirs -- they don't have their name listed publicly, and they may not want to use their real name on the agenda

[10:14:40.0043] <Chris de Almeida>
cc styfle ‚òùÔ∏è

[10:18:20.0271] <styfle>
I prefer `@styfle` since thats going to be the easiest way to identify me on github, matrix, x, etc

[10:21:09.0842] <Chris de Almeida>
if it's not for privacy reasons, it's preferable to use your real name in these contexts.  no pressure though üôÇ 

[10:21:27.0736] <Chris de Almeida>
* if it's not for privacy reasons, it's preferable and customary to use your real name in these contexts.  no pressure though üôÇ 

[10:21:36.0632] <styfle>
It is for privacy

[10:21:50.0586] <Chris de Almeida>
got it

[10:22:17.0364] <Michael Ficarra>
FYI, you're going to be recorded in the notes, associated with a TLA, and indexed in https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/delegates.txt

[10:23:17.0606] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Come on all, a pseudonym is perfectly fine if it's the only way we refer to somebody. I never showed anybody a document proving that Nicol√≤ is my real name. There are multiple reasons to not use the actual name people have in their documents.

It only gets problematic when we refer to somebody as X in half places and Y in the other half

[10:23:44.0133] <Michael Ficarra>
@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org that's exactly the thing I'm worried about though

[10:24:17.0514] <Michael Ficarra>
because in the notes and (presumably) in-person we're going to refer to them as their real name, but we have the agenda listing their GitHub name

[10:25:00.0330] <Chris de Almeida>
we have precedent for both pseudonyms and mononyms.  Ecma needs to know their identity, but we technically do not.  ultimately this is up to the individual to decide, not us

[10:25:52.0569] <Michael Ficarra>
if it was separate for privacy reasons, the best thing would've been to list only the real name on the agenda (and notes, etc), and the public wouldn't be able to associate it with the pseudonym

[10:29:09.0246] <Michael Ficarra>
we have no precedent for using pseudonyms in the notes

[10:29:38.0694] <ptomato>
we certainly do in TG2

[10:30:44.0184] <Chris de Almeida>
we do actually. I will DM

[11:00:17.0404] <Michael Ficarra>
I want to be clear about what I'm asking: for each delegate, we're going to list some name in delegates.txt alongside a TLA, and I would like to refer to the delegate by that name or TLA in other formal contexts, such as the agenda and during plenary. I don't care whether it's their legal name or common name or a pseudonym made just for this purpose, just that it's used consistently. I think the issue here was that we don't yet have an entry in delegates.txt for @styfle:matrix.org and I had assumed that they were going to use the name submitted in the new delegate form. Apologies for jumping the gun here. We can continue the conversation, if needed, once we figure out what's going in delegates.txt.

[11:01:39.0477] <styfle>
I would like to use `@styfle` for public documents

[11:12:52.0683] <Michael Ficarra>
would you make a PR to delegates.txt?

[11:13:07.0084] <Michael Ficarra>
I hope the ordering enforcement handles `@` properly üò∞

[17:01:03.0397] <styfle>
Well I realized I'm already in `fetch` https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/blob/main/fetch.bs

[17:01:15.0473] <styfle>
So here we go https://github.com/tc39/notes/pull/378

[17:12:50.0506] <bakkot>
reminder that the deadline to add things to the agenda for the coming meeting is in 17 hours

[17:13:07.0875] <bakkot>
currently it's pretty light

[19:36:56.0687] <styfle>
Added slides https://github.com/tc39/agendas/pull/1913

[22:56:18.0334] <bakkot>
awful lot of Slides TBD items still on the agenda

[22:57:41.0172] <bakkot>
general reminder that proposals looking to advance must link the supporting material by the deadline, in addition to being on the agenda. people need time to review things before the meeting.

[00:03:02.0237] <ljharb>
at least proposals trying to hit stage 2+
