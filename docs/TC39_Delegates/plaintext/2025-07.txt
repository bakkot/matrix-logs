I have definitely never heard anyone say the word milliard or billiard though

[20:59:23.0525] <rkirsling>
so I remain feeling like this is just some long troll being played on Americans

upon moving to Germany, I was confronted with the million/milliard/billion distinction fairly early on

webpack merged support for import defer proposal!

[09:11:17.0335] <dminor>
Would someone here have permissions to make mgaudet and I collaborators on https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-capturestacktrace? Neither of us has access to the settings since the transfer to the tc39 org, and I'd like to fix up the deploy of the spec text to gh-pages.

[09:14:08.0533] <Chris de Almeida>
mgaudet has write permission, and now you do as well

[09:14:14.0782] <Chris de Almeida>
* mgaudet already had write permission, and now you do as well

[09:17:45.0633] <dminor>
Thank you, but I'm still not seeing the `settings`, does that require a separate permission?

[09:54:41.0486] <Chris de Almeida>
oh.. yes

[09:55:34.0894] <Chris de Almeida>
try now

[11:13:32.0552] <dminor>
Working now, thank you for the help :)

Congratulations from my side and thank you for your contributions.

[06:54:18.0706] <Anthony Bullard>
Well, congratulations to Rob!

[10:38:07.0423] <Rob Palmer>
Thank you all!

[10:39:04.0959] <Rob Palmer>
And congrats to Michael Saboff who is doubly worth the recognition given his contributions to both TC39 and Ecma where he served as ExeCom Chair. 

[13:25:01.0097] <Aki>
Well deserved, both of you

[13:25:30.0524] <Aki>
Can someone point me to the conversation about normatively referencing WebIDL? I'm doingâ€¦ research.

[13:31:16.0031] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I think it's most in emails and calls, I'll forward them to you tomorrow 

[13:31:41.0812] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh nevermind I was thinking of infra, not webidl

[13:43:29.0450] <Michael Ficarra>
which conversation? the one from plenary?

[13:44:01.0903] <Aki>
I don't know, I saw it referenced at some point in Matrix. If there was one from the last plenary I can go read the notes!

[13:44:21.0428] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah you can see the notes for that

[13:44:27.0238] <Michael Ficarra>
also there's still conversation happening in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-idl/issues

[14:55:45.0496] <Aki>
do any of the TC39 standards from any TG reference anything published by w3c? (normatively or informatively)(or even in the biblio)

I hadn't realized that when node started doing automatic typescript type stripping they also exposed that functionality as an API

[14:06:56.0378] <bakkot>
that makes it pretty trivial to strip types when serving files

[14:07:32.0998] <bakkot>
which... I think eats most of the motivation for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations ? at least the motivations I was aware of

[09:28:16.0359] <Rob Palmer>
That is a very cool project, bakkot:

It shows how many pieces of the puzzle are coming to allow TS and ESM to be used in a simple way. 

[09:30:02.0612] <ljharb>
it'd be cool to also describe/provide a variant that avoids the speed overhead that takes one of these apps and pre-transpiles it so that it still works

[09:30:21.0592] <Rob Palmer>
On the motivations for type annotations, the Node work demonstrates that runtimes can play a large part in the story of reducing developer friction. Deno/Bun also showed that earlier on. 

[09:31:19.0101] <Rob Palmer>
There are still some remaining gaps, such a browser debugging. Using the console/REPL with TS still isn't as frictionless as using JS. 

[09:32:30.0865] <Rob Palmer>
The other motivation was language coordination. Something Mark raised strongly in Feb 2025 during the post plenary session on type annotations. Monutes are available.

[09:33:03.0494] <bakkot>
Fair point about language coordination, yeah

[09:33:41.0899] <bakkot>
myself I've always kind of been on the other side of that, because I like it when TS adds good syntax (`satisfies` etc) instead of trying to fit it into a pre-reserved syntax space

[09:34:53.0354] <Rob Palmer>
(Though I see the TS introduction of the new "erasableSyntaxOnly" tsconfig flag + TC39 advancement of the Stage 1 enum proposal as highly positive indications of all sides leaning in to attempts to coordinate already.)

[09:37:05.0424] <bakkot>
I actually have found that debugging ts-blank-space strip'd types is totally frictionless; do you just mean the bit where you can't copy-paste TS code into the repl? I think that would be adequately solved by having Chrome devtools ship swc

[09:48:29.0039] <Rob Palmer>
Yes, I mean copy-pasting into the REPL. And I agree that if we coordinate across the ecosystem to intercept all the places that JS is debugged so they implement these same type-stripping semantics, then from a user's perspective using TS should be pretty much as frictionless as JS.

[09:49:48.0459] <Rob Palmer>
(I.e. Chrome is not the only debugger) 


2025-07-08
[06:55:29.0062] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I wonder if we have a name for documents containing instructions for multiple parties in an ecosystem to coordinate on some shared agreed upon behavior...

[10:20:04.0318] <bakkot>
I definitely do not want typescript to have to go through a standards body to introduce new syntax, that is one of my main goals here
