I have definitely never heard anyone say the word milliard or billiard though

[20:59:23.0525] <rkirsling>
so I remain feeling like this is just some long troll being played on Americans

upon moving to Germany, I was confronted with the million/milliard/billion distinction fairly early on

https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/16567
webpack merged support for import defer proposal!

Would someone here have permissions to make mgaudet and I collaborators on https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-capturestacktrace? Neither of us has access to the settings since the transfer to the tc39 org, and I'd like to fix up the deploy of the spec text to gh-pages.

[09:14:08.0533] <Chris de Almeida>
mgaudet has write permission, and now you do as well

[09:14:14.0782] <Chris de Almeida>
* mgaudet already had write permission, and now you do as well

[09:17:45.0633] <dminor>
Thank you, but I'm still not seeing the `settings`, does that require a separate permission?

[09:54:41.0486] <Chris de Almeida>
oh.. yes

[09:55:34.0894] <Chris de Almeida>
try now

[11:13:32.0552] <dminor>
Working now, thank you for the help :)
