I have definitely never heard anyone say the word milliard or billiard though

[20:59:23.0525] <rkirsling>

webpack merged support for import defer proposal!

[09:11:17.0335] <dminor>
Would someone here have permissions to make mgaudet and I collaborators on https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-capturestacktrace? Neither of us has access to the settings since the transfer to the tc39 org, and I'd like to fix up the deploy of the spec text to gh-pages.

[09:14:08.0533] <Chris de Almeida>
mgaudet has write permission, and now you do as well

[09:14:14.0782] <Chris de Almeida>
* mgaudet already had write permission, and now you do as well

[09:17:45.0633] <dminor>
Thank you, but I'm still not seeing the `settings`, does that require a separate permission?

[09:54:41.0486] <Chris de Almeida>
oh.. yes

[09:55:34.0894] <Chris de Almeida>
try now

[11:13:32.0552] <dminor>

[13:25:01.0097] <Aki>
Well deserved, both of you

[13:25:30.0524] <Aki>
Can someone point me to the conversation about normatively referencing WebIDL? I'm doing‚Ä¶ research.

[13:31:16.0031] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I think it's most in emails and calls, I'll forward them to you tomorrow 

[13:31:41.0812] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh nevermind I was thinking of infra, not webidl

[13:43:29.0450] <Michael Ficarra>
which conversation? the one from plenary?

[13:44:01.0903] <Aki>
I don't know, I saw it referenced at some point in Matrix. If there was one from the last plenary I can go read the notes!

[13:44:21.0428] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah you can see the notes for that

[13:44:27.0238] <Michael Ficarra>
also there's still conversation happening in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-idl/issues

[14:55:45.0496] <Aki>
do any of the TC39 standards from any TG reference anything published by w3c? (normatively or informatively)(or even in the biblio)

I hadn't realized that when node started doing automatic typescript type stripping they also exposed that functionality as an API

[14:06:56.0378] <bakkot>
that makes it pretty trivial to strip types when serving files

[14:07:32.0998] <bakkot>
which... I think eats most of the motivation for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations ? at least the motivations I was aware of

[14:07:59.0587] <bakkot>
demo https://github.com/bakkot/buildless-ts-webapp


2025-07-07
[09:28:16.0359] <Rob Palmer>
That is a very cool project, bakkot:

It shows how many pieces of the puzzle are coming to allow TS and ESM to be used in a simple way. 

[09:30:02.0612] <ljharb>
it'd be cool to also describe/provide a variant that avoids the speed overhead that takes one of these apps and pre-transpiles it so that it still works

[09:30:21.0592] <Rob Palmer>
On the motivations for type annotations, the Node work demonstrates that runtimes can play a large part in the story of reducing developer friction. Deno/Bun also showed that earlier on. 

[09:31:19.0101] <Rob Palmer>
There are still some remaining gaps, such a browser debugging. Using the console/REPL with TS still isn't as frictionless as using JS. 

[09:32:30.0865] <Rob Palmer>
The other motivation was language coordination. Something Mark raised strongly in Feb 2025 during the post plenary session on type annotations. Monutes are available. 

[09:32:44.0225] <Rob Palmer>
* The other motivation was language coordination. Something Mark raised strongly in Feb 2025 during the post plenary session on type annotations. Minutes are available. 

[09:33:03.0494] <bakkot>
Fair point about language coordination, yeah

[09:33:41.0899] <bakkot>
myself I've always kind of been on the other side of that, because I like it when TS adds good syntax (`satisfies` etc) instead of trying to fit it into a pre-reserved syntax space

[09:34:53.0354] <Rob Palmer>
(Though I see the TS introduction of the new "erasableSyntaxOnly" tsconfig flag + TC39 advancement of the Stage 1 enum proposal as highly positive indications of all sides leaning in to attempts to coordinate already.)

[09:37:05.0424] <bakkot>
I actually have found that debugging ts-blank-space strip'd types is totally frictionless; do you just mean the bit where you can't copy-paste TS code into the repl? I think that would be adequately solved by having Chrome devtools ship swc

[09:48:29.0039] <Rob Palmer>
Yes, I mean copy-pasting into the REPL. And I agree that if we coordinate across the ecosystem to intercept all the places that JS is debugged so they implement these same type-stripping semantics, then from a user's perspective using TS should be pretty much as frictionless as JS.

[09:49:48.0459] <Rob Palmer>
(I.e. Chrome is not the only debugger) 


2025-07-08
[06:55:29.0062] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I wonder if we have a name for documents containing instructions for multiple parties in an ecosystem to coordinate on some shared agreed upon behavior...

[10:20:04.0318] <bakkot>
I definitely do not want typescript to have to go through a standards body to introduce new syntax, that is one of my main goals here

The next TC39 plenary is 28th-31st July.

___Reminder:___ The agenda advancement deadline is [July 18th 10:00 PDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20250718T18&msg=TC39%20Submission%20deadline) which is just over two days away.

Please try to share all materials by this time so folk can carry out their pre-plenary reviews.

[10:04:53.0113] <Michael Ficarra>
does anyone mind if I replace GitHub usernames with real names on the agenda?

[10:05:31.0594] <Michael Ficarra>
it's hard enough remembering everyone's name, affiliation, and TLA, I don't want to also have to remember their GitHub usernames

[10:14:00.0113] <Chris de Almeida>
fine to do it for Ruben, but please reach out to `@styfle` before changing theirs -- they don't have their name listed publicly, and they may not want to use their real name on the agenda

[10:14:40.0043] <Chris de Almeida>
cc styfle ‚òùÔ∏è

[10:18:20.0271] <styfle>
I prefer `@styfle` since thats going to be the easiest way to identify me on github, matrix, x, etc

[10:21:09.0842] <Chris de Almeida>
if it's not for privacy reasons, it's preferable to use your real name in these contexts.  no pressure though üôÇ 

[10:21:27.0736] <Chris de Almeida>
* if it's not for privacy reasons, it's preferable and customary to use your real name in these contexts.  no pressure though üôÇ 

[10:21:36.0632] <styfle>
It is for privacy

[10:21:50.0586] <Chris de Almeida>
got it

[10:22:17.0364] <Michael Ficarra>
FYI, you're going to be recorded in the notes, associated with a TLA, and indexed in https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/delegates.txt

[10:23:17.0606] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Come on all, a pseudonym is perfectly fine if it's the only way we refer to somebody. I never showed anybody a document proving that Nicol√≤ is my real name. There are multiple reasons to not use the actual name people have in their documents.

It only gets problematic when we refer to somebody as X in half places and Y in the other half

[10:23:44.0133] <Michael Ficarra>
@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org that's exactly the thing I'm worried about though

[10:24:17.0514] <Michael Ficarra>
because in the notes and (presumably) in-person we're going to refer to them as their real name, but we have the agenda listing their GitHub name

[10:25:00.0330] <Chris de Almeida>
we have precedent for both pseudonyms and mononyms.  Ecma needs to know their identity, but we technically do not.  ultimately this is up to the individual to decide, not us

[10:25:52.0569] <Michael Ficarra>
if it was separate for privacy reasons, the best thing would've been to list only the real name on the agenda (and notes, etc), and the public wouldn't be able to associate it with the pseudonym

[10:29:09.0246] <Michael Ficarra>
we have no precedent for using pseudonyms in the notes

[10:29:38.0694] <ptomato>
we certainly do in TG2

[10:30:44.0184] <Chris de Almeida>
we do actually. I will DM

[11:00:17.0404] <Michael Ficarra>
I want to be clear about what I'm asking: for each delegate, we're going to list some name in delegates.txt alongside a TLA, and I would like to refer to the delegate by that name or TLA in other formal contexts, such as the agenda and during plenary. I don't care whether it's their legal name or common name or a pseudonym made just for this purpose, just that it's used consistently. I think the issue here was that we don't yet have an entry in delegates.txt for @styfle:matrix.org and I had assumed that they were going to use the name submitted in the new delegate form. Apologies for jumping the gun here. We can continue the conversation, if needed, once we figure out what's going in delegates.txt.

[11:01:39.0477] <styfle>
I would like to use `@styfle` for public documents

[11:12:52.0683] <Michael Ficarra>
would you make a PR to delegates.txt?

[11:13:07.0084] <Michael Ficarra>
I hope the ordering enforcement handles `@` properly üò∞


2025-07-18
[17:01:03.0397] <styfle>
Well I realized I'm already in `fetch` https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/blob/main/fetch.bs

[17:01:15.0473] <styfle>
So here we go https://github.com/tc39/notes/pull/378

[17:12:50.0506] <bakkot>
reminder that the deadline to add things to the agenda for the coming meeting is in 17 hours

[17:13:07.0875] <bakkot>
currently it's pretty light

[19:36:56.0687] <styfle>
Added slides https://github.com/tc39/agendas/pull/1913

[22:56:18.0334] <bakkot>
awful lot of Slides TBD items still on the agenda

[22:57:41.0172] <bakkot>
general reminder that proposals looking to advance must link the supporting material by the deadline, in addition to being on the agenda. people need time to review things before the meeting.

[00:03:02.0237] <ljharb>
at least proposals trying to hit stage 2+


2025-07-23
[01:57:16.0619] <naugtur>
Slides for `new Global` https://github.com/endojs/proposal-new-global/tree/main/slides
some further clarifications pending. I'm new here, so any amount of kind feedback on what's worth adding/explaining will be appreciated.

[02:43:41.0640] <bakkot>
naugtur: for new proposals it's best to focus on the problem to be solved, rather than a particular solution 

[02:46:13.0762] <bakkot>
People may not remember Evaluators, so the comparison to that proposal isn't enough on its own

[10:26:41.0279] <TabAtkins>
naugtur: Yes to what bakkot said, tho I do generally see the obvious niceties of isolated test-runner or isolation environments. I don't understand how this has relevance to DSLs, tho, but that's the first bullet point on the motivation slide

[11:02:53.0070] <naugtur>
TabAtkins: the testrunner's API is the DSL in question - describe, it etc. - where the testing code is in a special global contour that should not be visible to the app sources being tested.

[11:07:01.0850] <TabAtkins>
Ahh, that's not what I usually think of when I hear DSL and evaluation contexts being mentioned together. Ok.


2025-07-24
[15:15:46.0598] <naugtur>
Is 5 min assigned to AsyncContext in the agenda a typo? It doesn't seem like the slides could be read that fast

[15:18:50.0823] <Andreu Botella>
I timed myself and it's not impossible

[15:19:37.0422] <Andreu Botella>
I did add a couple bullet points since then, but I think I can fit it in

[15:21:21.0891] <naugtur>
No discussion planned then

[15:22:25.0458] <Andreu Botella>
this was just an update on the work since the last plenary and our current plan aligns with the result of the brainstorming we did back then

[15:22:39.0478] <naugtur>
understood. 


2025-07-25
[10:29:50.0545] <Michael Ficarra>
it does mean the agenda's out of order though @abotella:igalia.com

[10:30:27.0454] <Michael Ficarra>
items with smaller timeboxes should be listed before other items at the same stage

new TCQ is not a complete rewrite.  it is a fork, main changes were to add abstraction to use with different infra, I think it's made containerized now.  shouldn't be much, if anything, in the way of feature diffs

So in favor of this, it's great

[13:31:23.0278] <Andreu Botella>
I thought this would be a first step, to then consider doing the same for set iterators and so on

[13:32:32.0125] <Michael Ficarra>
@abotella:igalia.com true, giving up on freezing and instead exploring the Array special-casing is ignoring how we could apply the freezing to other built-in iterators

[13:33:20.0997] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Chris de Almeida: I need to stop taking notes at the top of the hour, rather than when my topic starts as I said before

[13:35:07.0081] <Michael Ficarra>
spreading array literals happens more than you might think

[13:35:33.0338] <ljharb>
i would be surprised if arrays weren't many 9's of the things being spreaded

[13:36:01.0610] <Michael Ficarra>
we don't have an "optionally include this element" so it's common to spread `...(a ? [b] : [])` within an array initialiser

[13:36:06.0269] <kriskowal>
Our position at Agoric regarding initially immutable intrinsics is really subtle. When we create the HardenedJS environment, we don‚Äôt just freeze all of (what we call) Shared Intrinsics, but some of those intrinsics have to be changed, like `Date.now`, `Math.random`, so _in general_ we rely on the pervasive mutability of the language to enable language evolution. We do not believe the specific proposed change hinders us in building HardenedJS environments. But, for the evolution of the web, ‚ÄúEven the very wise do not know all ends‚Äù and pervasive mutability has been good actually, allowing us to plug all manner of holes.

ISO policy would theoretically cover Discourse. ISO's whole point (imo) boils down to "use LLMs all you want, just don't show your output to anyone"

[13:50:41.0199] <nicolo-ribaudo>
We can redact the notes before publishing them

[13:50:54.0861] <Michael Ficarra>
we saw that other venues are covering this behaviour in their CoC-equivalent policies, why wouldn't we?

[13:52:41.0929] <ljharb>
is the ISO's in a code of conduct? that's a very specific kind of document.

[13:54:04.0774] <Chris de Almeida>
I don't think so

[13:54:07.0918] <Michael Ficarra>
I think the ISO and ACM policies predate people calling these policies out as "CoC"

[13:54:36.0079] <Michael Ficarra>
but that's effectively what they are

[13:54:50.0170] <Michael Ficarra>
they govern your behaviour in your various interactions with those groups

[13:54:53.0139] <Chris de Almeida>
https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100011.html

[13:56:46.0439] <ljharb>
so they have a coc, and the ai policy is in a different document

[13:58:26.0692] <kriskowal>
I have learned that people are avoiding em-dashes and Oxford commas in order for their manually-intelligent writing less resemble AI-generated content. Is their a sufficiently reliable criterion that distinguishes rude vs non-rude generative content?

[13:58:43.0219] <ljharb>
psh, you can pry my oxford comma from my cold dead hands

[13:58:49.0831] <Michael Ficarra>
you prefer having more than one document that governs committee interactions?

[13:58:58.0809] <kriskowal>
You have failed CAPTCHA.

[13:58:59.0061] <ljharb>
we already do. that's what "how we work" is

[13:59:15.0469] <ljharb>
* we already do. that's what "how we work" is, and the contribution guide, and a number of other things

[13:59:40.0912] <Michael Ficarra>
none of those warn of formal consequences if not followed

[13:59:53.0610] <ljharb>
nor need they, we can impose consequences any time we want, arbitrarily

[13:59:58.0502] <ljharb>
i don'

[13:59:58.0929] <kriskowal>
* I have learned that people are avoiding em-dashes and Oxford commas in order for their manually-intelligent writing less resemble AI-generated content. Is their a sufficiently reliable criterion that distinguishes rude vs non-rude ~generative~ content, regardless of whether it‚Äôs generated?

[14:00:07.0390] <ljharb>
* i don't need permission to hide someone's comments on my proposal repo, for example

[14:00:21.0426] <Michael Ficarra>
we should not do that, we should have a written policy of the things that will have formal consequences associated with them

[14:00:27.0991] <Michael Ficarra>
like a CoC

[14:00:28.0244] <ljharb>
the purpose of this phrasing is to establish a norm; it doesn't imbue us with any new capabilities

[14:00:39.0496] <ljharb>
* the purpose of this phrasing is to establish a norm that we can cite; it doesn't imbue us with any new capabilities

[14:01:26.0576] <Michael Ficarra>
somebody interacting with committee should have all the tools/info they need to make a contribution without worry that it will come with consequences

[14:01:27.0078] <ljharb>
* the purpose of this addition, wherever it lives, is to establish a norm that we can cite; it doesn't imbue us with any new capabilities

[14:01:29.0696] <Michael Ficarra>
such as by reading the CoC

[14:01:47.0689] <ljharb>
ok but that's a "should" you believe, it's not the current rule/policy, nor is it the case in basically any venue

[14:01:58.0823] <ljharb>
and the CoC is already not the sole place one must read

[14:02:00.0368] <ryzokuken>
if the idea is to moderate contributions from external folks on github and discourse i don't see why formally making it a part of our coc is necessary

[14:02:03.0016] <ljharb>
* and the CoC is already not the sole place one must read to gather that info

[14:02:10.0880] <Michael Ficarra>
it's not?

[14:02:25.0461] <ljharb>
no. the contributor guide is the primary place, and *that* links to the CoC

[14:02:39.0788] <Andreu Botella>
I can take over

[14:02:40.0048] <ljharb>
the CoC talks about comportment and demeanor. the contributor guide talks about how you contribute.

[14:02:42.0942] <Michael Ficarra>
violations of the contributor guide don't get you banned

[14:02:51.0864] <ljharb>
they absolutely could if they're repeated

[14:03:03.0258] <ljharb>
and we wouldn't ban someone for a single AI-generated contribution anyways

[14:03:04.0605] <Michael Ficarra>
no matter how much I'd like to ban someone who omits the Oxford comma

[14:03:46.0786] <ljharb>
the goal isn't to ban people, it's to establish norms so enforcement isn't practically needed in the first place

[14:04:05.0993] <ljharb>
the consequences aren't the point - the *explicit expectation* is the point

[14:04:42.0441] <ljharb>
for example, if my kids only behave because of consequences then i've not done a good job :-)

[14:05:02.0647] <ljharb>
* for example, if my kids only behave because of consequences then i've not done a good job :-) (which, to be clear, is empirically the case at times)

[14:05:56.0977] <Chris de Almeida>
to be clear, use of generative AI in a way that we have prohibited would 100% be subject to enforcement action via the CoC regardless of where the guidance/rules live

[14:14:07.0191] <Michael Ficarra>
where will this bikeshedding be happening? the same coc repo thread?

[14:15:10.0596] <Chris de Almeida>
that issue and the forthcoming PR with the proposed text

[14:28:03.0625] <naugtur>
nicolo-ribaudo: part of your long paragraph is really mixed up. couldn't save it

[14:28:31.0266] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'll go through it, don't worry

[14:28:34.0169] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Thanks for the ping

[14:46:34.0359] <Andreu Botella>
let me fix my mic

[14:52:51.0986] <nicolo-ribaudo>
The whole presentation is already a summary :P

[14:55:50.0620] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Who volunteers to squeeze their 30min topic in the next 4 minutes?

[15:00:38.0362] <naugtur>
There were a couple moments where the transcriptionist would struggle to catch up and drop whole sentences. I think we could make a conscious effort to make a ~1 second pause after each outburst of content when one person is talking, especially with longer sentences where logic of the sentence is non-trivial.


2025-07-29
[05:59:24.0709] <styfle>
Are the meetings recording audio or video? Or is it just text transcripts?

[06:00:03.0917] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Just transcripts 

[07:23:22.0715] <kriskowal>
Yes, and my understanding is that individual presenters are welcome to ask the committee for permission to record their own presentations, but not the conversation about their presentation, and publish in their own venues. This happens rarely enough that I don‚Äôt feel bad reminding seasoned delegates. :-)

[09:53:43.0142] <ryzokuken>
@room we're starting in 7 mins!

[10:09:05.0595] <Michael Ficarra>
Rich Hickey created Clojure, Rich Harris created Svelte

[10:19:54.0046] <bakkot>
what if we just had an explicit "IsProxy"...

[10:20:07.0786] <bakkot>
I would also like to be able to tell if touching a random object in any way at all is going to have side effects

[10:20:15.0972] <bakkot>
I think that's a capability I should be allowed to have

[10:21:05.0061] <Michael Ficarra>
@bakkot:matrix.org you'll still have accessors to worry about

[10:21:19.0172] <bakkot>
I can tell if a non-proxy has an accessor

[10:23:25.0382] <Mathieu Hofman>
Where did nicolo-ribaudo 's AsyncContext question go ??

[10:24:21.0415] <Michael Ficarra>
people can delete their own TCQ items

[10:24:39.0483] <Mathieu Hofman>
I was interested in that question ;)

[10:25:23.0797] <Michael Ficarra>
you can always add it yourself

[10:25:27.0407] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I was going to say "Svelte will switch to AsyncContext rather than synchronously reading .then", but probably svelte moving away from it in a few years means that we'll never be able to assume everybody updated anyway 

[10:27:06.0327] <ljharb>
you know _i'm_ gonna love a `Promise.isPromise`

[10:27:30.0442] <Chris de Almeida>
no lies detected

[10:27:45.0483] <Justin Ridgewell>
styfle: I no longer have access to the private Vercel repos. Can you check if the AsyncLocalStroage polyfill I implemented for edge runtime usess a `.then` accessor?

[10:32:00.0512] <bakkot>
Mathieu Hofman: `Symbol.unthenable ` is _another_ lookup

[10:32:04.0917] <bakkot>
that's the opposite of the point

[10:32:31.0846] <nicolo-ribaudo>
4 hours on the last day all for this topic!

[10:32:50.0015] <Mathieu Hofman>
Right it'd require a non proxy check, and these to be non-configurable and non-writable, which is kinda meh

[10:33:07.0999] <bakkot>
just seems way worse than having an internal slot

[10:33:11.0660] <nicolo-ribaudo>
* 4 hours on the last day all for this topic! React with ü´† to vote in favour of this

[10:33:35.0892] <Mathieu Hofman>
I'd love a temp check on `Promise.isPromise` see if it'd be viable to bring as a proposal

[10:34:12.0863] <naugtur>
Would it also have `Promise.isThenable` ?

[10:34:21.0958] <bakkot>
you can sort of build it already by adding a `.constructor` t othe object

[10:34:31.0159] <bakkot>
* you can sort of build it already by adding a `.constructor` getter to the object and then `await`ing it

[10:34:38.0466] <bakkot>
so... would be nice to have something better than that

[10:34:46.0877] <bakkot>
except no one is doing that afaict

[10:34:47.0258] <naugtur>
`assert(!Promise.isThenable({}))` would be a good first line of program code

[10:36:31.0352] <Mathieu Hofman>
To be clear I would use `Promise.isPromise` to build a safe `Promise.safeResolve` and `Promise.withSafeResolvers` that introduces an extra tick unless the objects is an unmodified native promise.

[10:36:38.0496] <Mathieu Hofman>
* To be clear I would use `Promise.isPromise` to build a safe userland `Promise.safeResolve` and `Promise.withSafeResolvers` that introduces an extra tick unless the objects is an unmodified native promise.

[10:37:42.0396] <Mathieu Hofman>
Why not `assert(!Object.getOwnProperty(Object.prototype, 'then'))` ?

[10:38:57.0202] <bakkot>
what if we changed the `in` operator to return `false` if there is a nonwritable-nonconfigurable `undefined`-valued data property

[10:39:11.0857] <mgaudet>
Whooooooops

[10:39:13.0712] <bakkot>
so that we could just make `Object.prototype.then` permanently undefined without breaking people doing `'then' in foo`

[10:39:21.0294] <naugtur>
My idea was to be future-compatible with a situation when there's a change to then on prototypes being ignored when considering a thenable

[10:39:44.0405] <ljharb>
my immediate instinct is that would break a ton of things in subtle ways

[10:39:57.0908] <Mathieu Hofman>
The TCQ queue didn't advance for me

[10:39:58.0175] <bakkot>
I bet it would be fine, that situation doesn't come up much

[10:49:59.0730] <Chris de Almeida>
still?

[11:09:57.0385] <Mathieu Hofman>
bakkot: did I capture your suggestion correctly regarding stack accessor being a closure? https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-capturestacktrace/issues/1#issuecomment-3133528880

[11:10:15.0818] <bakkot>
yup

[11:22:13.0652] <rbuckton>
This is one of the reasons I pushed for `static {}` to be included in the same edition as private fields, so that they were more likely to be transpiled in the same step to avoid any intermediate static private fields.

[11:24:24.0907] <snek>
not that people *can* object to babel making changes...

[11:29:32.0783] <keith_miller>
I think TCQ is still on "Non-extensible Applies to Private status update"

[11:40:14.0982] <bakkot>
https://github.com/whatwg/webidl/issues/1487

[11:48:41.0054] <ryzokuken>
sorry for the TCQ hiccups everyone, we're taking note of every bug and issue and will finally have the chance to get all the fixes in by the next meeting thanks to the volunteers working on the fork 

[11:59:46.0807] <Aki>
Back on my notes reminder: also don't forget to go clean up your summaries and conclusions. If you spoke them, go in quick and make them into bulleted lists or otherwise clear and concise copy

[12:03:15.0423] <Aki>
As far as remembering to record your summaries and conclusions, I'll start reminding individual speakers (privately) tomorrow.

[12:58:45.0573] <Chris de Almeida>
we are restarting

[13:01:12.0126] <Andreu Botella>
I can take notes

[13:02:08.0764] <naugtur>
I could do the next 30 minutes, but then I'm off to sleep

[13:07:03.0188] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Idea: note taking duty falls on the delegates in the timezone of the meeting

[13:08:26.0170] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Love the slides telling me I gave feedback way too late, sorry Michael
