as we're working on the "if you didn't write it, why should anybody read it" text that may or may not go in the CoC, I feel curious to ask whether anybody has suggestions for how to gently express a similar sentiment toward colleagues

who don't seem to realize the impression they're giving off by having a bot speak on their behalf

I think that's actually a relatively polite way to put it already, if couched in the right tone.

For anyone interested in the More Random Functions proposal, it's been updated to a Stage 1 version <https://github.com/tc39/proposal-random-functions> that cuts it down to just uniform random numbers and bytes. The other sets of methods have been split out to Random Collection Functions <https://github.com/tabatkins/proposal-random-collection-functions> and Random Non-Uniform Distributions <https://github.com/tabatkins/proposal-random-distributions>, both at Stage 0, per the Stage 1 advancement conditions.

(And for that matter, Random.Seeded <https://github.com/tc39/proposal-seeded-random> has been updated with the meeting feedback, and is ready for further review from anyone interested.)
