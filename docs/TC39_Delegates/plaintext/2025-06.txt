as we're working on the "if you didn't write it, why should anybody read it" text that may or may not go in the CoC, I feel curious to ask whether anybody has suggestions for how to gently express a similar sentiment toward colleagues

[18:32:19.0678] <rkirsling>
who don't seem to realize the impression they're giving off by having a bot speak on their behalf

[00:31:51.0189] <TabAtkins>
I think that's actually a relatively polite way to put it already, if couched in the right tone.

For anyone interested in the More Random Functions proposal, it's been updated to a Stage 1 version <https://github.com/tc39/proposal-random-functions> that cuts it down to just uniform random numbers and bytes. The other sets of methods have been split out to Random Collection Functions <https://github.com/tabatkins/proposal-random-collection-functions> and Random Non-Uniform Distributions <https://github.com/tabatkins/proposal-random-distributions>, both at Stage 0, per the Stage 1 advancement conditions.

(And for that matter, Random.Seeded <https://github.com/tc39/proposal-seeded-random> has been updated with the meeting feedback, and is ready for further review from anyone interested.)

canadahonk: Math.clamp needs a summary/conclusion in the notes

[15:41:45.0079] <bakkot>
Michael Ficarra is doing his best to fill out conclusion but please review and also fill out the summary

[16:06:31.0287] <Michael Ficarra>
@tabatkins:matrix.org your random functions and seeded random topics are also missing conclusions

[16:45:13.0719] <shu>
i think tab is playing with goats

[16:54:34.0304] <Michael Ficarra>
we really need like a post-topic checklist/flowchart

[16:54:42.0899] <Michael Ficarra>
@mikbar-uib:matrix.org ^

[16:55:12.0278] <Michael Ficarra>
we are always forgetting conclusions, assigned reviewers, slide links, ...

apparently ISO 26262 is on functional safety in the auto industry

(factoid from a Toyota presentation @ AsiaLLVM, do with it as you will)

Does someone from Mozilla want to edit down the summary on IDL for ECMAScript for brevity and clarity?

[01:51:47.0670] <Aki>
Also, a ton of these are missing links to proposals and slides too üòÆ‚Äçüí®

Since I'm seeing a lot of this, I'm just going to mention it. The "Speaker's Summary of Key Points" and "Conclusion" are different things. The former, Speaker's Summary of Key Points, is instructive for what goes into the official minutes of the meeting. It should summarize your presentation and any key points brought up in conversation after. "Conclusion" is the end result of the session‚Äîi.e. "this proposal has advanced to stage 2.7; will be reviewed by XYZ & ABC" or "The authors of the proposal will return at a future meeting after working out the details on [major point discussed at plenary] to seek stage 3 advancement."
