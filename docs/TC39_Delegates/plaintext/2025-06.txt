as we're working on the "if you didn't write it, why should anybody read it" text that may or may not go in the CoC, I feel curious to ask whether anybody has suggestions for how to gently express a similar sentiment toward colleagues

[18:32:19.0678] <rkirsling>
who don't seem to realize the impression they're giving off by having a bot speak on their behalf

[00:31:51.0189] <TabAtkins>
I think that's actually a relatively polite way to put it already, if couched in the right tone.

For anyone interested in the More Random Functions proposal, it's been updated to a Stage 1 version <https://github.com/tc39/proposal-random-functions> that cuts it down to just uniform random numbers and bytes. The other sets of methods have been split out to Random Collection Functions <https://github.com/tabatkins/proposal-random-collection-functions> and Random Non-Uniform Distributions <https://github.com/tabatkins/proposal-random-distributions>, both at Stage 0, per the Stage 1 advancement conditions.

[15:23:26.0852] <TabAtkins>
(And for that matter, Random.Seeded <https://github.com/tc39/proposal-seeded-random> has been updated with the meeting feedback, and is ready for further review from anyone interested.)

canadahonk: Math.clamp needs a summary/conclusion in the notes

[15:41:45.0079] <bakkot>
Michael Ficarra is doing his best to fill out conclusion but please review and also fill out the summary

[16:06:31.0287] <Michael Ficarra>
@tabatkins:matrix.org your random functions and seeded random topics are also missing conclusions

[16:45:13.0719] <shu>
i think tab is playing with goats

[16:54:34.0304] <Michael Ficarra>
we really need like a post-topic checklist/flowchart

[16:54:42.0899] <Michael Ficarra>
@mikbar-uib:matrix.org ^

[16:55:12.0278] <Michael Ficarra>
we are always forgetting conclusions, assigned reviewers, slide links, ...

apparently ISO 26262 is on functional safety in the auto industry 

[01:35:24.0892] <rkirsling>
(factoid from a Toyota presentation @ AsiaLLVM, do with it as you will)

[01:47:33.0882] <Aki>
Does someone from Mozilla want to edit down the summary on IDL for ECMAScript for brevity and clarity?

[01:51:47.0670] <Aki>
Also, a ton of these are missing links to proposals and slides too üòÆ‚Äçüí®

Since I'm seeing a lot of this, I'm just going to mention it. The "Speaker's Summary of Key Points" and "Conclusion" are different things. The former, Speaker's Summary of Key Points, is instructive for what goes into the official minutes of the meeting. It should summarize your presentation and any key points brought up in conversation after. "Conclusion" is the end result of the session‚Äîi.e. "this proposal has advanced to stage 2.7; will be reviewed by XYZ & ABC" or "The authors of the proposal will return at a future meeting after working out the details on [major point discussed at plenary] to seek stage 3 advancement."


[02:01:06.0053] <arai>
which document is this about? if there's anything missing, I'm happy to fill

[02:05:01.0448] <arai>
oh, maybe the notes document? I'll look into it shortly 

[02:20:42.0237] <Aki>
Right, thank you arai 

[02:22:36.0105] <Aki>
This meeting wasn't our best work in terms of documentation, but it's not too late! For anyone who presented, even if you know you already wrote a summary and/or conclusion, i strongly urge you to go back and review that 1. your proposal/PR and slide links are provided 2. that there's a clear summary of the topic and discussion, and 3. that the conclusion is recorded

[02:36:28.0956] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm still having trouble understanding the difference Aki

[02:44:18.0231] <Aki>
Like, a conclusion of "this propsal is now at stage 2" tells me _nothing_ about the time we spent in the meeting. a summary that says "these were the key points brought up by the presentation. the conversation brought up important concerns regarding the implementation of this one detail. overall the committee was supportive of moving forward."

[02:45:03.0406] <Aki>
i should be able to read nothing but the summaries and get a general concept of what we talked about in the meeting. that's where meeting minutes come from.

[04:51:47.0802] <Rob Palmer>
We should document this definition in how-we-work because the question keeps getting asked.
