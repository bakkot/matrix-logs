Justin Ridgewell: it doesn't seem like there's any test262 PR yet for array grouping, am i missing it?

[12:54:23.0354] <Justin Ridgewell>
Correct

I think @yulia volunteered a her grad students to write them?

[13:18:07.0917] <ljharb>
i was going to crib them for my polyfill packages, but ended up writing my own (but they won't be pushed up til stage 3, which hopefully is this month)

how does one create a meeting on 8x8.vc under the /tc39 slug? we have 8x8.vc/tc39/inclusion, so I know it's possible; I'd like to make one for the pattern matching champions' call

(cc Rob Palmer who I thiiink has been managing 8x8?)

8x8 has many mysteries. For me, it seems I can just use any name under the TC39 space. So you could try making one up. If that does not work I can make you an admin to see if that makes a difference.

yeah I did try just visiting `8x8.vc/tc39/pattern-matching` and got a 404. got your invite link though, thank you!

ljharb maybe we can combine efforts (but i want them to write their own)

[01:32:49.0416] <yulia>
I will see where they are with them today

[01:33:09.0991] <yulia>
but we don't have to exclusively use the students tests
