how does one create a meeting on 8x8.vc under the /tc39 slug? we have 8x8.vc/tc39/inclusion, so I know it's possible; I'd like to make one for the pattern matching champions' call

(cc Rob Palmer who I thiiink has been managing 8x8?)

8x8 has many mysteries. For me, it seems I can just use any name under the TC39 space. So you could try making one up. If that does not work I can make you an admin to see if that makes a difference.
