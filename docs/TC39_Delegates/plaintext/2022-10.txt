TabAtkins: you (apparently) signed up to review the Set methods proposal ~ 4 years ago. It's been long enough and gone through enough revisions that it's basically a different proposal at this point, but all the same, do you still want to review? It's up at https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods, also I have slides for the November meeting at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SvBt_0yPuK39Zz7Tg7nBdPGJkZvTlJ2UOYrDuiX60Ks

(no pressure if you're not up for reviewing)

[14:43:01.0610] <TabAtkins>
Oh jeez, uh, sure, yeah, I'd happily do so

[14:44:53.0822] <bakkot>
thanks!

I may or may not go for stage 3 at the November meeting but either way am hoping for no further changes to it (except in response to reviews / implementation feedback)
