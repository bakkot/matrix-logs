apologies to anyone following https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/294 for redirecting someone who was, in retrospect, definitely just using AI into that thread

[07:28:37.0714] <bakkot>
I thought they might be but wanted to give the benefit of the doubt

[07:28:43.0831] <bakkot>
we gotta have a policy about this

Are there existing examples of such policies for other standards or projects?

[00:28:42.0317] <snek>
I think most projects don't allow low effort/spam posts. and github itself also doesn't allow these things.

[07:43:15.0858] <bakkot>
this isn't exactly spam; I'm certain there was an individual human driving this request because they actually wanted it

[07:43:35.0843] <bakkot>
they were just getting the AI to write arguments for it, and to respond to objections

[08:24:02.0210] <ljharb>
most places don't have sufficient bureaucracy to require a policy, they just unilaterally ban it and call out people who seem like they're using LLMs

[15:47:04.0270] <snek>
this is why "low effort" is part of the qualification as well
