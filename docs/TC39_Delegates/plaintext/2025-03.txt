apologies to anyone following https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/294 for redirecting someone who was, in retrospect, definitely just using AI into that thread

[07:28:37.0714] <bakkot>
I thought they might be but wanted to give the benefit of the doubt

[07:28:43.0831] <bakkot>
we gotta have a policy about this


2025-03-03
[23:58:42.0420] <Rob Palmer>
Are there existing examples of such policies for other standards or projects?

[00:28:42.0317] <snek>
I think most projects don't allow low effort/spam posts. and github itself also doesn't allow these things.

[07:43:15.0858] <bakkot>
this isn't exactly spam; I'm certain there was an individual human driving this request because they actually wanted it

[07:43:35.0843] <bakkot>
they were just getting the AI to write arguments for it, and to respond to objections

[08:24:02.0210] <ljharb>
most places don't have sufficient bureaucracy to require a policy, they just unilaterally ban it and call out people who seem like they're using LLMs

[15:47:04.0270] <snek>
this is why "low effort" is part of the qualification as well

[16:15:38.0070] <ptomato>
I don't mind if people want to polish their text with LLMs so that they can make themselves understandable in English with confidence. I've seen that in real life enabling better participation from people whose English level is prohibitive. ideally any policy we adopt wouldn't exclude that

[16:30:50.0120] <ljharb>
it's very tricky to allow any legit usage while disallowing all illegit usage tho. quite frankly i'd rather someone post a reply in their native language and _i_ do the translation for myself, than that they post something that appears to be in english but isn't idiomatic and has weird flaws

[16:37:30.0035] <ptomato>
that would work, as well. we'd have to be quite clear that it's encouraged, though; in many open source spaces non-English contributions are closed just as quickly than obvious LLM work, by well-meaning contributors

[14:11:22.0018] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Allowing multiple languages severely impacts search

[15:15:56.0729] <shu>
looking at RegExp.prototype[Symbol.replace] to fix a bug, what is this monstrosity? is this the most complicated builtin we have


2025-03-05
[16:47:40.0815] <ljharb>
all the regex symbols are a monstrosity :-(

[18:39:00.0274] <bakkot>
have you considered just introducing more bugs, instead of fixing the bug

[18:39:14.0240] <bakkot>
if there's enough incompatible bugs across all the engines then no one will use it and we can rip it out

[23:43:01.0565] <littledan>
Yeah it would be pretty great if someone could try ripping out the stuff about replacing exec. But as of 2016-ish it turned out people actually did replace it. But probably just silly polyfills and xregexp 

[23:43:24.0434] <littledan>
And when those were written, they didnâ€™t expect to get called into by replace

[23:43:46.0672] <littledan>
So it is just like the case that Mozilla looked into a little bit and then decided it wasnâ€™t worth their time to look further

thoughts on making the proposals table more concise by changing all the people's names to their notes shortcut + a link to the line in delegates.txt?

[08:55:19.0136] <ptomato>
could we just delete the authors and champions columns?

[08:55:40.0937] <ptomato>
that info is in the proposal's README anyway and the proposals table is just one more place for it to get out of date

[08:55:55.0222] <ptomato>
 * that info is in each proposal's README anyway and the proposals table is just one more place for it to get out of date

[08:57:10.0622] <Michael Ficarra>
@pchimento:igalia.com it's a useful way to find which proposals a person is championing

[08:57:10.0712] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Do GitHub tables support `<abbr>` elements? `<abbr title="NicolÃ² RIbaudo">NRO</abbr>`

[08:57:34.0036] <Michael Ficarra>
(ashamedly, I have to search my own name on this page sometimes to remind me what I have to work on)

[08:58:44.0146] <ptomato>
I was going to ask "how often do you have to search the proposals page to look up what someone is championing" but I guess I have my answer ðŸ˜„

[08:59:28.0428] <Michael Ficarra>
not all of us can focus on a single proposal for 7 years straight

[09:00:44.0427] <ptomato>
how dare you sir. I've only been at this particular grindstone for 5 years ðŸ˜„

[09:01:05.0962] <ljharb>
yeah i definitely don't want to delete the info; individual proposals are inconsistent at storing info, which is why we added the reviewers column.

[09:01:55.0934] <ljharb>
i can definitely use an `<abbr>` *as well* as a link, that seems pretty accessible. including the full name will make the markdown much larger but the rendered table smaller.

[09:02:09.0894] <Richard Gibson>
sadly not: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/9681

[09:02:19.0959] <ljharb>
boo

[09:03:01.0014] <ljharb>
so would just `[JHD](link to my line in delegates.txt)` be acceptable?

[09:03:10.0979] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I guess we could start by shortening/removing the author and not the champion? It seems like it's less relevant info

[09:03:13.0526] <ljharb>
* so would just `[JHD](link to my line in delegates.txt)` be acceptable? i don't want to type out a full `<a>` :-)

[09:03:31.0808] <ljharb>
ah just realized authors might not have delegates abbreviations

[09:03:34.0933] <ljharb>
* ah, just realized authors might not have delegates abbreviations

[09:03:44.0125] <ljharb>
so the shortening would only work for delegates

[09:52:05.0366] <Michael Ficarra>
still an improvement I guess

[10:01:08.0076] <bakkot>
I would prefer to keep the full names because I have not memorized everyone's abbreviations

[10:01:20.0828] <bakkot>
so it would be much harder to read if we replaced names with abbreviations

[10:01:45.0101] <bakkot>
I don't think concision is all that valuable for this

[10:13:21.0501] <ljharb>
even if all the abbreviations were clickable?

[10:14:28.0021] <Michael Ficarra>
I mean it's a big table and GH squeezes it into 900px

[10:14:29.0863] <Michael Ficarra>
concision helps

[10:17:16.0627] <ljharb>
another benefit is that there'd be a single source of truth for the correct spelling/accents/etc of someone's name

[11:15:27.0576] <bakkot>
yes because then I have to scroll through the entire table clicking every abbreviation

[11:15:31.0368] <bakkot>
which is much worse than just reading it

[11:39:21.0498] <ljharb>
would a hover with the full name (which is probably still worse) be tolerable?

[11:42:39.0931] <kriskowal>
If it also reminds me that Kevin means bakkot ðŸ˜‰

> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> This is super early, however â€” a few of us will be taking the train to go to the A CoruÃ±a meeting in May (mostly from NL and UK). If anybody traveling from somewhere in western Europe wants to join us please write me a message by the end of February :)

More details about this, if anybody wants to join. Right now we are about 5 people.

Feel free to message me :)

Hey, I was looking through some of the notes from the last plenary, and I noticed that for "Don't call well-known Symbol methods for RegExp on primitive values", it was pointed out that core-js implements the proposed PR rather than the spec

[12:06:58.0695] <Andreu Botella>
and that doesn't seem to be true: https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/packages/core-js/modules/es.string.match.js#L20
