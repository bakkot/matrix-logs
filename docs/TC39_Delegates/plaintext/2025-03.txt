apologies to anyone following https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/294 for redirecting someone who was, in retrospect, definitely just using AI into that thread

[07:28:37.0714] <bakkot>
I thought they might be but wanted to give the benefit of the doubt

[07:28:43.0831] <bakkot>
we gotta have a policy about this

[23:58:42.0420] <Rob Palmer>
Are there existing examples of such policies for other standards or projects?

[00:28:42.0317] <snek>
I think most projects don't allow low effort/spam posts. and github itself also doesn't allow these things.

[07:43:15.0858] <bakkot>
this isn't exactly spam; I'm certain there was an individual human driving this request because they actually wanted it

[07:43:35.0843] <bakkot>
they were just getting the AI to write arguments for it, and to respond to objections

[08:24:02.0210] <ljharb>
most places don't have sufficient bureaucracy to require a policy, they just unilaterally ban it and call out people who seem like they're using LLMs

[15:47:04.0270] <snek>
this is why "low effort" is part of the qualification as well

I don't mind if people want to polish their text with LLMs so that they can make themselves understandable in English with confidence. I've seen that in real life enabling better participation from people whose English level is prohibitive. ideally any policy we adopt wouldn't exclude that

[16:30:50.0120] <ljharb>
it's very tricky to allow any legit usage while disallowing all illegit usage tho. quite frankly i'd rather someone post a reply in their native language and _i_ do the translation for myself, than that they post something that appears to be in english but isn't idiomatic and has weird flaws

[16:37:30.0035] <ptomato>
that would work, as well. we'd have to be quite clear that it's encouraged, though; in many open source spaces non-English contributions are closed just as quickly than obvious LLM work, by well-meaning contributors

[14:11:22.0018] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Allowing multiple languages severely impacts search

looking at RegExp.prototype[Symbol.replace] to fix a bug, what is this monstrosity? is this the most complicated builtin we have


2025-03-05
[16:47:40.0815] <ljharb>
all the regex symbols are a monstrosity :-(

[18:39:00.0274] <bakkot>
have you considered just introducing more bugs, instead of fixing the bug

[18:39:14.0240] <bakkot>
if there's enough incompatible bugs across all the engines then no one will use it and we can rip it out

[23:43:01.0565] <littledan>
Yeah it would be pretty great if someone could try ripping out the stuff about replacing exec. But as of 2016-ish it turned out people actually did replace it. But probably just silly polyfills and xregexp 

[23:43:24.0434] <littledan>
And when those were written, they didn’t expect to get called into by replace

[23:43:46.0672] <littledan>
So it is just like the case that Mozilla looked into a little bit and then decided it wasn’t worth their time to look further

thoughts on making the proposals table more concise by changing all the people's names to their notes shortcut + a link to the line in delegates.txt?
