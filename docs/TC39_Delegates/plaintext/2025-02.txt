Reading through https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42876840, it seems like the most wanted proposals are Records&Tuples and pattern matching

Let's do both of them!

It looks like we will get a **Community Event in Seattle** on the evening of **Thursday 20th February.**  Please can folk who are attending volunteer some talks!

- [**Call For Speakers**](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/550)

SeattleJS are asking us to provide all the content for the evening, so I hope we can deliver lots of exciting talks.
