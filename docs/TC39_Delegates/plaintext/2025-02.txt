Reading through https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42876840, it seems like the most wanted proposals are Records&Tuples and pattern matching

Let's do both of them!

It looks like we will get a **Community Event in Seattle** on the evening of **Thursday 20th February.**  Please can folk who are attending volunteer some talks!

- [**Call For Speakers**](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/550)

SeattleJS are asking us to provide all the content for the evening, so I hope we can deliver lots of exciting talks.

Does anyone know why we decided not to look for private fields on the prototype chain of any object? This somewhat came up in 2 different proposal discussions lately: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-access-expressions/issues/26 and https://github.com/ljharb/proposal-error-stack-accessor/issues/3 (the latter is for a internal slot but same idea)

It would likely break a ton of  "brand checks" use cases, but really there isn't an easy way to even create a helper to search the prototype chain as one cannot get a "ref" for the private field.

the helper would need to take a callback: `(o) => #p in o`
