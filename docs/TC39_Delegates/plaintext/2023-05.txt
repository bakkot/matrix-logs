> <@littledan:matrix.org> We definitely could have done accessors for fields. It would have certain advantages and disadvantages. I am also very confident that, if we did that, people would have said “this has lots of footguns, look this basic code doesn’t work as expected”

enumerability of accessors is likely one of those footguns on the other side.

Could I get push access to https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-modules, to "rebase" it on top of the updated import attributes proposal?

(also the link to the countdown timer in the agenda is broken)

who owns `tc39.es`? did someone mess with the DNS settings recently? looks like the subdomain we were using for PR previews is gone

[12:42:17.0460] <shu>
Registrant	Ecma International


[12:42:21.0385] <shu>
fascinating

[12:42:40.0523] <bakkot>
/facepalm

[12:43:02.0021] <bakkot>
we could and maybe should switch to just using github pages, I guess

[12:43:44.0620] <shu>
also interesting that `.es` has no whois server

[12:43:46.0706] <bakkot>
(which would solve the problem by not being a subdomain, to be clear)

[12:58:10.0517] <nicolo-ribaudo>
The DNS has been recently transferred to Ecma, there is some discussion in #tc39-website:matrix.org

[13:00:24.0200] <shu>
Ecma does not have a good track record of having working technical infrastructure

[13:00:30.0915] <shu>
why... was that done

[13:05:52.0161] <Rob Palmer>
The DNS was metered.  Aki's bill rose dramatically following a DDoS attack.  We asked Ecma to switch to unmetered DNS.

[13:06:09.0830] <Rob Palmer>
s/bill/cheque for US folk

[13:06:56.0659] <bakkot>
I was not aware that it was possible for DNS to be metered

AWS have more ways of making money than you may imagine.

[13:09:23.0366] <shu>
wow

[13:09:36.0990] <shu>
i'm learning a lot, all of it unpleasant

[13:18:06.0387] <Aki>
Lol my bill went from 1¢/month to… I haven’t checked in a minute. It was like $40 last I checked but on its way to $100 if traffic continued.

[13:35:20.0149] <bakkot>
$100 of dns queries is a distressing amount of dns queries

bakkot: probably my fault. I must've missef a non-AWS A record. just let me know and I can add it

it's the `ci.tc39.es` record, if you still can find the original ones

Rob Palmer: Hi! A colleague from a different team at Mozilla just asked me about attending the upcoming plenary as an observer. Is there any process that needs to be followed for that, or can they just show up?

[05:42:54.0733] <ryzokuken>
I think just notifying on the reflector thread should suffice

[06:47:08.0279] <Rob Palmer>
The July plenary meeting is coming up and it scheduled to be in Bergen, Norway!

- https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/471

Please fill out [the interest survey](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/471) by Wednesday so that we can predict attendance numbers and make a call on whether it will be hybrid or remote-only.

[07:22:24.0602] <littledan>
Do we have an issue tracking the details of the June plenary? I was having trouble finding one.

[08:01:25.0808] <Rob Palmer>
We have [the May plenary](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/470) next.

[15:39:48.0012] <shu>
is there some canonical example somewhere of "promise ticks are observable"?

[15:41:07.0232] <bakkot>
shu: 
```
(async () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
    console.log(i);
    await 0;
  }
})();
// other stuff here
```

[15:41:25.0948] <bakkot>
order in which the `console.log`s fire relative to other effects in other stuff is observable

[15:41:36.0588] <bakkot>
that said engines are wildly inconsistent in a lot of cases so like

[15:41:40.0306] <bakkot>
don't worry too much about it

[15:41:45.0708] <bakkot>
users certainly shouldn't

[15:48:10.0489] <shu>
thanks

I certainly hope the number of ticks is not something programs are not sensitive to since we have the faster promise adoption proposal that would likely change that.

Are there normally automated Chinese-language spambots commenting in the tc39/proposals repo? I just posted an [issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/issues/470) there and got two Chinese-language responses within 4 minutes. General question: what's the normal process for dealing with spam comments in TC39 repos?

[00:21:14.0774] <littledan>
What I have assumed in the past is that everyone with the appropriate permissions can simply delete spam comments without needing special permission (unlike bad behavior, best referred to the code of conduct committee). If they are persistent, you can escalate to the CoC committee or any chair to get a ban out in place.

[08:12:56.0041] <ljharb>
let’s not delete things since that leaves no record; certainly hide them as spam tho
