> <@littledan:matrix.org> We definitely could have done accessors for fields. It would have certain advantages and disadvantages. I am also very confident that, if we did that, people would have said “this has lots of footguns, look this basic code doesn’t work as expected”

enumerability of accessors is likely one of those footguns on the other side.

/facepalm

we could and maybe should switch to just using github pages, I guess
