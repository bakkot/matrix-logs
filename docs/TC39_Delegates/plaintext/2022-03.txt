Hey; I've got [a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1757162) which essentially boils down to this little test case

```
class A {
    #x = "hello";
    constructor(o = this.#x) {
        this.value = o;
    }
};

var a = new A;
// Does new A throw? if not, does a.value have the value of `hello`?
```

I'm trying to figure out what the spec says and got a little confused

[14:24:02.0915] <mgaudet>
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-evaluatenew says that ArgumentListEvaluation happens before the constructor is invoked; but AFAICT it's the constructor that actually allocates the object... 

[14:24:35.0604] <mgaudet>
does ArgumentListEvaluation not actually... evaluate the arguments? ie, is the processing of the default argument deferred until later?
