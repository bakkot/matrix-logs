Hey; I've got [a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1757162) which essentially boils down to this little test case

```
class A {
    #x = "hello";
    constructor(o = this.#x) {
        this.value = o;
    }
};

var a = new A;
// Does new A throw? if not, does a.value have the value of `hello`?
```

I'm trying to figure out what the spec says and got a little confused

[14:24:02.0915] <mgaudet>
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-evaluatenew says that ArgumentListEvaluation happens before the constructor is invoked; but AFAICT it's the constructor that actually allocates the object... 

[14:24:35.0604] <mgaudet>
does ArgumentListEvaluation not actually... evaluate the arguments? ie, is the processing of the default argument deferred until later? 

[14:31:39.0687] <bakkot>
`ArgumentListEvaluation` evaluates _the arguments_, not the parameters

[14:32:16.0995] <bakkot>
it's the thing which would trigger the `console.log` in `f(console.log(0));`, not the thing which would trigger the `console.log` in `function f(x = console.log(0)) {}; f()`

[14:32:59.0899] <mgaudet>
yeah; I think I've got the latter traced down further into https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-functiondeclarationinstantiation 

[14:33:32.0804] <mgaudet>
(which seems to imply that the answer is that private fields ought to be available in that parameter expression) 

[14:33:55.0892] <mgaudet>
(I always get bit when coming back to arguments/formals/parameters) 

[14:36:38.0597] <bakkot>
yeah

[14:37:36.0990] <bakkot>
specifically, for base classes, class fields are created/installed by [[construct]] step 6.b: https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ordinary-and-exotic-objects-behaviours.html#sec-ecmascript-function-objects-construct-argumentslist-newtarget

[14:38:04.0399] <bakkot>
 * specifically, for base classes, class fields are created/installed by [[construct]] step 6.b: https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ordinary-and-exotic-objects-behaviours.html#sec-ecmascript-function-objects-construct-argumentslist-newtarget

[14:39:12.0103] <bakkot>
and parameter defaults (and other expressions) are evaluated later, in [[construct]] step 8, via OrdinaryCallEvaluateBody -> EvaluateBody -> EvaluateFunctionBody -> FunctionDeclarationInstantiation -> IteratorBindingInitialization

[14:40:11.0699] <bakkot>
so private fields (and all other fields) are available (for base classes) by the time the parameter list is evaluated

[14:40:28.0166] <mgaudet>
Yep :) Was writing that out... less nicely than you in the bug :P
