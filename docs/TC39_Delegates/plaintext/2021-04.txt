hello friends

[09:52:18.0526] <Rob Palmer>
would anyone like to join me in premium Jitsi?  https://8x8.vc/tc39/main

[09:52:25.0780] <ryzokuken>
hello!

[09:52:29.0280] <Rob Palmer>
it has a TC39 logo and everything

[09:52:44.0109] <ryzokuken>
oooo, premium

[09:52:44.0721] <Aki>
i've been trying for the past 10 minutes

[09:52:45.0815] <ryzokuken>
give me a sec

[09:52:49.0344] <Rob Palmer>
oh

[09:52:58.0031] <Aki>
my 8x8 meet account is broken

[09:53:40.0465] <Rob Palmer>
yeah i've found i must start on the 8x8 homepage and click login first

[09:54:50.0988] <Rob Palmer>
but for people without accounts, the raw link should work

[09:55:29.0146] <Aki>
no i mean my account is actually broken. it's in a login loop on safari (even private window) and if i can ever get in to it i have to then delete it so i can recreate it because i created it ~~the wrong way~~

Where can I find documentation on the difference between `?` and `!` in ecmarkup spec text?  I don't see it mentioned on https://tc39.es/ecmarkup/

[09:15:04.0242] <littledan>
It's in the notational conventions section of the spec itself

[10:25:51.0936] <sffc>
Thanks! More specifically: https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-returnifabrupt-shorthands

[10:32:33.0290] <ryzokuken>
you mean the matrix bridge?

[10:32:44.0282] <ryzokuken>

[10:33:05.0821] <Aki>
i sent those two messages from my like five+ minutes ago

[10:47:38.0590] <ryzokuken>
could someone give rbuckton and danielrosenwasser level 10 access so they can post here?

[11:35:29.0759] <mpcsh>
> <@usharma:igalia.com> could someone give rbuckton and danielrosenwasser level 10 access so they can post here?

I'm pretty sure anyone can grant anyone their own power level?

[11:35:59.0217] <rbuckton>
I have access now

[11:39:33.0083] <ryzokuken>
> <@mpcsh_:matrix.org> I'm pretty sure anyone can grant anyone their own power level?

nope, you need `admin` for that

[11:10:00.0230] <danielrosenwasser>
hm

[11:11:14.0648] <ryzokuken>
there's already bridges to Discord, Slack, Telegram, IRC etc

[11:12:02.0227] <danielrosenwasser>
can one use an individual plan for free with this? :D

[11:12:12.0417] <danielrosenwasser>
 * can one use an individual plan for free with this? :D

[11:12:16.0797] <ryzokuken>
that said, I'm not quite sure of EMS, some of the servers they host seem really poorly managed...

which individual plan specifically?

[11:16:45.0170] <danielrosenwasser>
I don't know, I don't know anything about this tech, just give me a responsive chat client.

[11:17:30.0232] <ryzokuken>
well, that's understandable. as long as we use a decently managed homeserver, things should be fine.

[11:17:54.0921] <ryzokuken>
it's not perfect, for instance, but the Igalia homeserver is pretty snappy!
