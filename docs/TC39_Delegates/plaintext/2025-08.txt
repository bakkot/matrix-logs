Isn't that the correct way to capture it in the notes? "This is ZTZ, also know as ZTZ or ZTZ online, but you can call him ZTZ".

Where can I read the notes?

they're linked in the Reflector issue

```
function safePromiseCapability() {
  let { promise, resolve, reject } = Promise.withResolvers();
  function safeResolve(val) {
    Object.defineProperty(val, 'then', { configurable: true, value: void 0 });
    resolve(val);
    delete val.then;
  }
  return { promise, safeResolve, reject };
}

let evilProto = { get then() { throw 'boom'; } };

let { promise, safeResolve } = safePromiseCapability();
safeResolve({ __proto__: evilProto, key: 'value' });
console.log((await promise).key); // no boom
```
turns out we already have the "safe promise resolve" capability with no changes to the language

I... don't understand how that's safe. Doesn't that override/delete a .then property on the element, potentially wiping out an existing .then property?

[21:32:44.0862] <bakkot>
sorry, yes, the assumption is that you are only using this with an object you've just created yourself

[21:32:55.0296] <bakkot>
and you're trying to avoid the problem where someone might have put a `.then` on Object.prototype

[21:33:25.0614] <bakkot>
* sorry, yes, the assumption is that you are only using this with an object you've just created yourself, which you know not to have such a property

[21:35:00.0663] <bakkot>
* ```
function safePromiseCapability() {
  let { promise, resolve, reject } = Promise.withResolvers();
  function safeResolve(val) {
    if (Object.hasOwn(val, 'then')) throw new TypeError('you are not supposed to use this with thenables');
    Object.defineProperty(val, 'then', { configurable: true, value: void 0 });
    resolve(val);
    delete val.then;
  }
  return { promise, safeResolve, reject };
}

let evilProto = { get then() { throw 'boom'; } };

let { promise, safeResolve } = safePromiseCapability();
safeResolve({ __proto__: evilProto, key: 'value' });
console.log((await promise).key); // no boom
```

This example makes my concern about having `.then` being called with a thenable (and thus `.then(x => x)` not being an identity) moot, since it's already possible
