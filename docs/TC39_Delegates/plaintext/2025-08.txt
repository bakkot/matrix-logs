Isn't that the correct way to capture it in the notes? "This is ZTZ, also know as ZTZ or ZTZ online, but you can call him ZTZ".

Where can I read the notes?

they're linked in the Reflector issue

```
function safePromiseCapability() {
  let { promise, resolve, reject } = Promise.withResolvers();
  function safeResolve(val) {
    Object.defineProperty(val, 'then', { configurable: true, value: void 0 });
    resolve(val);
    delete val.then;
  }
  return { promise, safeResolve, reject };
}

let evilProto = { get then() { throw 'boom'; } };

let { promise, safeResolve } = safePromiseCapability();
safeResolve({ __proto__: evilProto, key: 'value' });
console.log((await promise).key); // no boom
```
turns out we already have the "safe promise resolve" capability with no changes to the language
