[The September Tokyo plenary invite](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/499) is now posted on the Reflector.

If anyone needs support on visas (e.g. generating an invite letter from the host), please let me know.  It is just under 12 weeks away.

[04:56:12.0750] <littledan>
Note that we are working on a community event the evening before, on the 25th.

Chairs: Any concern if I extend the timebox for the Explicit Resource Management update by 15 minutes to cover a suggestion that came up last week? The schedule currently calls for a 15 minute underflow on the day/time I'm currently scheduled to present. If that's not feasible, I'll see what I can squeeze in in the time I have available and offer to discuss further with interested parties after the plenary.

The whole room is "hot".  Meaning all mics on the whole time.  So we need everyone to avoid noise unless they are speaking, e.g. placing cups down gently.

[01:34:37.0740] <Christian Ulbrich>
Rob Palmer: Although it would be possible to mute each mic directly, because they have a direct mute button.

[01:35:40.0179] <Rob Palmer>

I don't think it's that useful to make things like this optional?

at least not optional for web browsers

as a programmer I am going to want to rely on their existence

[02:00:55.0438] <littledan>

[02:01:11.0604] <bakkot>
and as a user I'm going to be annoyed if the page behaves differently in my browser than the one the developer was using

[02:01:57.0939] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
but when it comes to internationalization, that's bound to happen, right?

[02:02:05.0159] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
I mean, I totally agree with the general sentiment

[02:02:54.0023] <bakkot>
... is it?

[02:03:01.0769] <Michael Ficarra>
bakkot: ligatures and opentype features are optional; that doesn't make a font not useful

[02:03:25.0043] <littledan>

well, we still try to limit the scope of this

[02:03:36.0561] <littledan>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> ... is it?

it is because different browsers make different tailorings of the data

no

[02:11:25.0796] <Michael Ficarra>
I think it is littledan just surprisingly close to the mic

[02:11:52.0528] <rbuckton>
Is someone typing on an open mic?

[02:12:20.0835] <littledan>
sorry that may be me. Is it fixed now?

[02:12:25.0935] <littledan>
(I moved off of the table)

[02:12:38.0389] <bakkot>
there are not currently typing noises

[02:13:34.0084] <HE Shi-Jun>
> <@jackworks:matrix.org> no

If support boolean I would like it also support `null` :)

[02:14:16.0015] <Michael Ficarra>
HE Shi-Jun: Jack Works: I would oppose that because I want to keep a future open where we do not ToString these value

[02:15:17.0439] <bakkot>
yeah I like keeping the restrictions tight until there are concrete things we want to loosen them for

[02:15:52.0249] <bakkot>
definitely I can imagine features where we'd want `true`, `false`, `null` etc but I think we can come back when that's relevant?

[02:15:55.0320] <HE Shi-Jun>
we do ToString for attribute values now?

[02:16:05.0743] <bakkot>
otoh I guess this is partially for bundlers to build out there own things so maybe that doesn't make sense

[02:34:23.0743] <Michael Ficarra>
I support auto deferral in this case, but I don't want this or iterators to be considered precedent to justify auto deferring in future proposals

[02:43:02.0107] <Bradford Smith>
could someone remind me what "hint" means in this context?

[02:43:15.0233] <Michael Ficarra>
it's an alias in the spec

[02:43:15.0834] <littledan>
it means "flag" in practice

[02:43:19.0440] <littledan>
it's a silly name

[02:43:35.0402] <Michael Ficarra>
it's used in places where we provide an AO with context about its use

[02:44:18.0802] <Bradford Smith>
so it's not something specific to the syntax for Explicit Resource Management, then. Thanks

[02:44:33.0013] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
yeah, I always assumed that it was a contextual hints from the caller, as in toPrimitive

[02:44:34.0259] <Michael Ficarra>
correct, entirely spec internal

[02:44:45.0428] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
 * yeah, I always assumed that it was a contextual hint from the caller, as in toPrimitive

[02:44:46.0996] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@bradfordcsmith:matrix.org> so it's not something specific to the syntax for Explicit Resource Management, then. Thanks

Well, in this specific case the hint is whether we are using `using` or `await using`

[02:45:18.0103] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
hmm, I would've said the word "context" is better but at this point it's so overloaded that it's probably not

[02:45:50.0132] <Michael Ficarra>
same with "flag"

[02:48:39.0885] <nicolo-ribaudo>
ptomato (at TC39, limited availability): It is not possible unless we want all the `const` and `let` declaration to perform property access

[02:52:05.0891] <bakkot>
or if we change the semantics of `using`, like suggested here

[02:52:16.0159] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> ptomato (at TC39, limited availability): It is not possible unless we want all the `const` and `let` declaration to perform property access

Oh well, the resource could throw if it's used before accessing its `[Symbol.dispose]` property

[02:52:49.0591] <bakkot>
that's kinda cute actually

[02:53:04.0025] <Luca Casonato>
And also, it is totally reasonable to move around disposables using `let` or `const`, before passing it to a `using`

[02:53:08.0261] <bakkot>
but probably confusing

[02:53:25.0187] <littledan>
if we want to seriously consider Symbol.enter, we should demote this proposal to Stage 2

[02:55:58.0663] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
> <@lucacasonato:matrix.org> And also, it is totally reasonable to move around disposables using `let` or `const`, before passing it to a `using`

I don't quite understand how you envision this

[02:56:18.0885] <Michael Ficarra>
littledan: I think it works fine as a follow-on

[02:58:48.0537] <littledan>
this is not the kind of thing that will be good to have a compatibility matrix around. It's also not some complicated uncertain technology--we know the design space already.

[03:00:11.0620] <Bradford Smith>
littledan: Are you concerned about avoiding a future where some disposables are wrapper objects that pseudo-enforce use of `using` and some are not?

[03:00:45.0616] <littledan>
it will be annoying to have to reason about different possible ways that this protocol could be implemented, in general. Possible, but annoying

is tcq.app down for anyone else? The console says
```

wKFO:1 Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.
```

[03:04:03.0581] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
yeah, it's down again

[03:09:53.0928] <rbuckton>
To clarify, I am fine with not providing a recommendation to ensure cleanup if a disposable is dropped on the floor, regardless as to the practice in other languages. It was brought up in #159 as one of the concerns about dropping a disposable is that native handles that are usually just tracked by a `number` value can leak and are not visible in a heap dump.

[03:11:23.0275] <rbuckton>
That said, it is feasible to implement a "cleanup on GC" behavior using `FinalizationRegistry` in user code if needed, given that's one of `FinalizationRegistry`'s use cases, and such behavior already exists in NodeJS for many native handles.

[03:24:49.0138] <rbuckton>
Regarding the `Symbol.enter` suggestion, I have been considering the following as a follow-on proposal:

`Symbol.enter` (or `Symbol.enterContext`?) - indicates a method that, when invoked, enters a context and returns a value associated with that context. This method is optional, and if missing is implicitly handled as if the definition was:

```
[Symbol.enter]() {
  return this;
}
```

`Symbol.exit` (or `Symbol.exitContext`?) - indicates a method that is invoked when the context is exited at the end of the block. Receives two arguments, `hasError` and `error`, that indicate whether an exception occurred prior to context exit. The method may return `true` to inform the caller not to throw `error` (swallowing the exception). Any other return value is ignored, indicating the caller should throw `error`. The method may also choose to throw its own error, but should not throw `error` itself. This method is also optional, and if missing is implicitly handled as if the definition was:

```
[Symbol.exit](hasError, error) {
  try {
    this[Symbol.dispose]();
  } catch (e) {
    if (hasError) {
      throw new SuppressedError(e, error);
    } else {
      throw e;
    }
  }
  return undefined;
}
```

Thus, `[Symbol.dispose]()` on its own would constitute a lightweight context manager.

[03:28:48.0847] <rbuckton>
Things do become more complex for async context managers, however, given that they must `await` the result of `[Symbol.asyncEnter]()` if we were to adhere to the Python design. `await using x = y` would potentially Await twice: once at the declaration site in the presence of a `[Symbol.asyncEnter]()` method, and once at the end of the block for the `[Symbol.asyncExit]()` or `[Symbol.asyncDispose]()` call. 

[03:31:45.0193] <rbuckton>
Finally, `AsyncDisposableStack.prototype.use` becomes *slightly* more complicated as it may return a `Promise` if the resource that is passed to `use` is an async context manager. `use` itself doesn't necessarily need to become async, however, since all it needs to do is return the result of calling `[Symbol.asyncEnter]()`. If you were to pass in a sync context or a disposable, it would not need to return a `Promise`.

[03:32:56.0584] <rbuckton>
Context managers are extremely powerful, but also extremely complex, which is why I have been reticent to consider them for this proposal. 

[03:36:08.0463] <rbuckton>
I also didn't want the general purpose `[Symbol.dispose]` behavior to be complicated by the error handling and error suppression semantics of `__exit__`, as the majority of cases related to resource management have no need of that complexity.

[04:47:01.0032] <Chris de Almeida>
as discussed, we will place this information in a more accessible place rather than buried in a GH issue

[04:48:22.0110] <Chris de Almeida>
we should document some points of contact who have edit access so it's not ambiguous who to contact when needing to make calendar updates

[04:48:55.0502] <Chris de Almeida>
at the very least the chairs, but other folks with edit access may be willing to make themselves available for this purpose

[04:49:54.0835] <littledan>
maybe we should give edit access somewhat more broadly?

[04:50:16.0756] <littledan>
I don't really see why I should have more access than others

[04:50:32.0879] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
I think we have a high enough degree of trust within the committee to share edit access to the calendar more broadly, yes

[04:50:48.0997] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
like the calendar edit permission is not really that critical now that I think about it

[04:50:50.0081] <ljharb>
that said, calendar management can be tricky and it's really easy to accidentally fire off dozens of email notifications

In fact it looks like the source map meetings might've been randomly deleted or something

I guess that makes sense given that those operations are not actually part of the calendar protocol

[04:52:49.0996] <Michael Ficarra>
yeah I'm fine with delegating the calendar management as long as the people are decently responsive

[04:52:52.0625] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
the calendar protocol is weird actually, but maybe you have some degree of a backlog in your emails

I'd support you

[04:57:42.0176] <shu>
littledan: so actually for the loop bound recomputation bugs there are already tests AFAICT

syg: I wonder if throwing if there was a concurrent too-large grow makes sense, since if the concurrent grow happens just after this thread's grow returns, you'd still have a too-large buffer when you try to use it

Andreu Botella: you mean throwing if there is _any_ race?

[04:59:18.0103] <shu>
i don't think so, because racing for too-large cannot be reliably detected

[04:59:37.0176] <Andreu Botella>
no, I mean you'd still have a race in user code if the concurrent grow happens just a bit too late

[04:59:46.0784] <shu>
right, you can't detect that

[04:59:57.0035] <Andreu Botella>
so why try to detect it inside the loop?

[05:00:15.0695] <Andreu Botella>
well, I guess you'd have to detect it anyway, but why throw

[05:00:24.0443] <shu>
the race inside the loop is for the opposite case, where grow(10) races with grow(20)

[05:00:32.0321] <Rob Palmer>
https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping/issues/57

[05:00:35.0443] <shu>
and grow(20) happens first, and grow(10) is now a shrink

[05:00:38.0615] <shu>
and is disallowed

[05:00:49.0337] <shu>
it's throwing not because of a race per se, it's throwing because shrinks already throw

[05:01:07.0247] <shu>
you could have it silently do nothing, that's a possibility

[05:01:09.0094] <Andreu Botella>
After a grow, you know the SAB is *at least* the size you've grown it too

[05:01:15.0527] <Andreu Botella>
so I'm not thinking of the grow(10) as a shrink

[05:01:21.0051] <Andreu Botella>
maybe a user might

[05:02:05.0767] <shu>
that's fair, this could be relaxed, but it's shipped with these semantics already and i don't feel particularly compelled to change it

[05:02:13.0487] <Andreu Botella>
oh, right, a slightly-too-late grow(10) would indeed throw

[05:02:21.0297] <Andreu Botella>
that makes sense then

[05:02:22.0007] <shu>
the actual answer is just... don't race your grows

yeah I think this is generally not the right kind of thing to do with low-level concurrency primitives

[05:05:11.0115] <littledan>
So, should we have a brief overflow topic to get through the conditionality?

[05:05:20.0725] <littledan>
if msaboff expects to review it tonight

[05:05:59.0809] <littledan>
it has not really been helpful to replace what we were calling "conclusion" with "summary". The idea was to be more detailed.

[05:06:17.0467] <shu>
agreed with littledan, i think hand-holding lock-free concurrency stuff is just not a good idea

[05:06:18.0216] <littledan>
we've had a conclusion for a long time

[05:07:01.0905] <Michael Ficarra>
the request from this morning is just that we don't forget to add a conclusion

[05:07:56.0271] <littledan>
this is false. The request from Ecma has been to add summaries. We had been adding conclusions previously.

[05:08:23.0330] <littledan>
I'm really confused by the resistance from the committee to summaries. I really think they would make the notes more accessible.

[05:08:42.0882] <littledan>
the idea is to cover the main points in the presentation and discussion, not only the things we got consensus on

[05:09:08.0246] <littledan>
if a delegate doesn't want to write a summary, that's OK, but I don't understand why they should oppose others writing summaries...

[05:10:49.0452] <ljharb>
i don't recall any opposition to someone just going in and adding a summary - i thought the opposition was just to pausing the meeting and/or asking champions to write a summary

[05:11:07.0858] <ljharb>
 * i don't recall any opposition to someone just going in and adding a summary - i thought the opposition was just to pausing the meeting and/or asking champions to write a summary, but maybe i'm not remembering right

[05:21:34.0330] <Chris de Almeida>
the summaries (with or without a conclusion) are very helpful.  it takes only a moment for the speaker to dictate a summary.  I don't think there's a lot of controversy with this, but in the past IIRC it was only because it was perceived to take up too much committee time.  but I think that was also when we were sitting there waiting for the speaker (or someone else) to type up the summary, whereas it should just be dictated, which should only take a moment, and can be cleaned up async as needed

[05:22:45.0343] <Chris de Almeida>
so yes, Jordan is right that it was in opposition to pausing the meeting. it's such a small sacrifice though and is a lot easier to do when it's timely

[05:24:23.0552] <Chris de Almeida>
but 100% almost every time in recent memory where I needed to refer to meeting notes, it was so helpful to have those summaries rather than having to scour the entire dialog

i think either function call count or sample count - but I don't know for sure

[05:52:17.0953] <ljharb>
i believe there's nonzero use cases where if a module starts using TLA, things will break - i forget which off the top of my head tho

> <@ljharb:matrix.org> i believe there's nonzero use cases where if a module starts using TLA, things will break - i forget which off the top of my head tho

If it has side effects and a module that does not list it as a dependency relies on its side effects

[05:55:02.0965] <ljharb>
hm, that's not what i was thinking of, but since i can't recall specifics rn, ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

[05:55:05.0042] <rbuckton>
i.e.:
```js
// a.js
import defer * as ns from "foo";
// defer until `ns` property accessed.

// b.js
import defer { a, b } from "foo";
export function f() { console.log(a, b); } // defer until `f` is called

// c.js
import defer { a, b } from "foo";
console.log(a, b); // not actually deferred

for well-behaved graphs I don't think it's ever breaking; it's only if there's weird side-effect ordering problems that it breaks

[05:56:27.0366] <bakkot>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> I wonder if we could employ a heuristic where named imports that are only used in functions are deferred until the first function call?

fwiw that seems like too much magic to me

> <@bakkot:matrix.org> for well-behaved graphs I don't think it's ever breaking; it's only if there's weird side-effect ordering problems that it breaks

we've hit that. we have code `onAppInstall.addListener(...)` which the callback is _only_ called if the callback is registered in 1st event loop.

[05:57:37.0460] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> fwiw that seems like too much magic to me

`defer` itself is too much like magic

[05:58:08.0841] <bakkot>
the thing where the namespace object implicitly has side-effecting accessors is, just barely, not too magic for me

[05:58:19.0640] <bakkot>
the previous suggestion of having local access be side-effecting was too magic

[05:58:24.0891] <bakkot>
but property access can already be side-effecting

[05:58:28.0838] <Luca Casonato>
bakkot: Most places I have seen TLA in is leaf modules (for example Wasm loading), or the top level entrypoint (for example data fetching in a CLI). In my experience TLA anywhere between entrypoint and leaf is very rare.

why would wasm loading be a leaf?

[05:59:00.0824] <bakkot>
wasm is just like... code

[05:59:08.0479] <rbuckton>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> `defer` itself is too much like magic

but also, determining whether named imports are lexically scoped to functions is statically analyzable, with the exception of direct-`eval` (which could just block deferred evaluation anyways).

[05:59:24.0022] <Jack Works>
+1 I don't think it's magical for the `ns` case. Direct import binding is a little bit magic but also good to me.

[06:00:17.0505] <Michael Ficarra>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> why would wasm loading be a leaf?

... because it needs to be passed an imports object? how can it not be a leaf?

[06:01:51.0372] <bakkot>
I guess I mean a difference sense of "loading"

[06:02:00.0740] <bakkot>
yes, loading the bytecode is a leaf, of cousre

[06:02:03.0623] <bakkot>
 * yes, loading the bytecode is a leaf, of course

[06:03:02.0537] <bakkot>
but if you have a library which has a wasm component, it seems like "TLA to async-compile the wasm" is a pretty normal use case

[06:03:56.0303] <bakkot>
which means your library's entry point would have a TLA, not just the leafs of the library

[06:05:57.0951] <shu>
i don't think i'm confused

[06:06:08.0207] <shu>
i'm saying in JS, compilation can be transparently deferred and folded into evaluation

[06:06:19.0838] <shu>
in wasm because timing is of a bigger concern, it cannot be generally transparently deferred

[06:06:54.0635] <Jack Works>
I also want to notice the deferred is not only the compilation happened in the engine, but also the _execution_ of the JS code

[06:06:55.0388] <shu>
and the motivating number of "half the time spent in evaluation" as shown by the profiler output suggests that that includes main-thread deferred compilation

[06:07:07.0677] <shu>
well yes, obviously the execution is the main thing to be deferred

[06:07:16.0402] <shu>
i'm questioning the "half the time" measure and what it includes

[06:07:18.0551] <sffc>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/Instance/Instance#syntax says in a big red box, "Warning: Since instantiation for large modules can be expensive, developers should only use the Instance() constructor when synchronous instantiation is absolutely required; the asynchronous WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming() method should be used at all other times."

[06:07:58.0049] <sffc>
^ This is about the sync constructor after you already have an async compiled Module

[06:08:01.0853] <Jack Works>
for example https://github.com/alexcorvi/anchorme.js/pull/127 this library cost 30ms to init (this PR is reverted by the author). We now using `defer` to save this 30ms

[06:08:11.0708] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> i'm questioning the "half the time" measure and what it includes

right, the thing is, we have a whole bunch of data about the benefit of this, and the champions were conservative about what they included on slides. I think it's reasonable that you ask how much benefit this will get on the web.

[06:08:28.0228] <littledan>
I would point out, though, that when it's a cache hit, the fetching and compiling part might be pretty quick

[06:08:30.0139] <shu>
i'm convinced it's a win for JS for sure

[06:08:57.0427] <shu>
the wasm questions got me doubting about how well the performance story composes

[06:08:58.0946] <Rob Palmer>
Synchronous lazy loading in CommonJS is sometime known as "inline requires".  Jest managed to [half their startup time](https://jestjs.io/blog/2016/03/11/javascript-unit-testing-performance#inline-requires-and-lazy-mocking) by incorporating this technique.

[06:09:03.0020] <shu>
or are we also introducing performance footguns

[06:09:17.0379] <littledan>
I guess I don't understand the performance breakdown case

[06:10:35.0663] <littledan>
you're all right that we should investigate this better for Wasm. I think this should block Stage 3.

[06:10:52.0626] <littledan>
I should've realized that earlier, so thanks for raising it

[06:11:06.0324] <Michael Ficarra>
Chris de Almeida: have you considered just implementing https://github.com/bterlson/tcq/issues/14?

[06:11:26.0430] <Michael Ficarra>
there's so many good things on the TCQ issue tracker

[06:11:28.0100] <eemeli>
I wonder if a module could say e.g. `"defer load"` to communicate that if it's loaded via `import defer`, all of its imported dependencies could be completely deferred until its evaluation.

[06:11:50.0878] <shu>
well i think the wasm case is generalizable to a certain kind of module with a certain weight profile of time spent in which phases

[06:12:04.0521] <shu>
the high-order bit for me is "does the performance story compose"

[06:12:16.0381] <bakkot>
concretely, I have published exactly one wasm-based library (z3-solver). It's CJS-based so it has an async `init` function, but if it was ESM-based it would totally have a top-level `await` in its entrypoint, not at a leaf. and it's doing a nontrivial amount of computation on load, of exactly the sort I'd hope to be deferring by the use of `defer`.

[06:12:20.0177] <shu>
can someone who doesn't need sync evaluation can just always insert `defer` and get some loading wins

[06:12:37.0123] <Chris de Almeida>
Michael Ficarra: yeah.. I think we need a DX workflow presentation from BT first

[06:13:50.0703] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> the high-order bit for me is "does the performance story compose"

right, I think this comes down to some details of the algorithm for exactly what is made eager. It's a good action item for the champions to articulate some more cases to investigate this. My intuition is that it should work out as long as you do `import defer` for the imports from within the module that uses TLA--then you get the deferred-ness back

[06:13:56.0556] <Rob Palmer>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> the high-order bit for me is "does the performance story compose"

Given our experience deploying an ESM system, we've found the ESM performance composition story is not viable without this feature.

[06:18:12.0048] <ljharb>
webpack might be the TLA breaking change i was thinking of

[06:19:08.0400] <danielrosenwasser>
I know bakkot  mentioned something like this - but it does feel like `import defer` is going to ring the wrong bells for a lot of people who expect this won't even do script parsing.

Not that I am necessarily advocating for that behavior.

this proposal is good enough for sync usage. I have no idea about TLA and WASM and we  haven't try that yet.

[06:20:14.0875] <Ashley Claymore>
fwiw, at Bloomberg we still encourge use of fully-async dynamic import when that is viable. This proposal has been great for the places where it has not been viable to go fully async

[06:20:32.0170] <shu>
Ashley Claymore: see that smells really off to me

[06:21:54.0675] <Ashley Claymore>
the current situation when it is not viable is that code is written to be fully eager.

[06:26:02.0853] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> Ashley Claymore: see that smells really off to me

it's pretty common that you're writing code that's not in an async function... I don't think that's going to go away.

[06:26:03.0505] <shu>
Ashley Claymore: but it doesn't smell right to me (yet) that we've been saying "asyncify" and now saying "well, if you did asyncify if you wanna take advantage of this new deferral thing you might not be able to"

[06:27:14.0899] <Rob Palmer>
shu: Using dynamic import would only neuter the deferred import if the dynamic import were awaited at top-level.  The general advice is to never do that.  Instead, dynamic import is best used just-in-time inside async functions that require it.

[06:27:51.0339] <shu>
i mean top-level await is a thing?

[06:28:08.0535] <shu>
i don't know how to reconcile that we added it with "actually the general advice is to never do that"?

In some way, this is a key part of providing a well-scoped amount of feature parity from CJS into, since CJS has always supported this pattern (differently, just by having sync require, which is more general than this feature)

I think this isn't actually the advice--it's more like, if you want the deferral to happen, you also need to defer the imports within the TLA-containing module, and not put the only `defer` things higher up in the module graph

also i don't want to allocate BigInts?

[06:43:43.0332] <littledan>
yeah I guess if we wanted to support 64-bit integers we'd need stuff for, like, adding two bigints and then rounding to the right 64-bit int (possible to define in multiple ways for signed vs unsigned). I'm not convinced we need that--my hope was that BigInt.asUintN would be a suitable replacement (to call after the bigint arithmetic op)

[06:44:29.0045] <littledan>

I guess the hope is that the compiler would do representation analysis and avoid allocating BigInts

[10:02:32.0506] <shu>
i think it's good and healthy to revisit, and overturn, previous design decisions based on new evidence

[10:03:52.0542] <shu>
but still in this particular case and future ones i don't want to conflate "good" defaults and developer signal

[10:07:10.0173] <shu>
the end goal for me is users, not developers, and good defaults for me should be chosen to nudge developers to the result (responsiveness, correctness, fast loading, whatever) we want on products they build for the user. if _all_ developers ignore a default constantly, then we obviously failed and nobody benefits. Google-internally, i did not get this sense when talking with practitioners

[10:08:48.0957] <shu>
this is all to say that it's a common argument in committee to say "look developers all do X and want Y", and it's not really that much signal to me most of the time

how do you feel about DX as motivation for proposals in general?

[10:11:17.0446] <shu>
i think it is a weak motivation by itself

[10:13:07.0335] <shu>
as a general rule i do not think DX outweighs other concerns like security and performance

[10:13:28.0533] <shu>
if the other concerns are minimal, then DX is the right thing to optimize for

[10:14:59.0532] <shu>
but at the scale of JS and the web, until we figure out a way to do zero-cost DX improvements, it is explicitly a non-goal for me

[10:21:27.0525] <shu>
(it is not an anti-goal, i'm not saying i will actively oppose DX proposals, just that it is not a thing i will push for and find compelling standalone, but i certainly won't block absent other concerns)

the problem is we cannot everything by default because it's a breaking change

[20:03:36.0124] <shu>
the context of my previous comment was about the Promise constructor vs withResolvers

[20:04:14.0834] <Jack Works>
oh

[20:04:29.0446] <shu>
the "good default" was referring to the hope that the Promise constructor would, even though it's more inconvenient to use, would bring about better correctness results wrt uncaught exceptions -> rejections

[20:04:56.0737] <shu>
but since then we've learned that maybe that doesn't have quite the effect we hoped because people ignore it

[20:05:01.0237] <shu>
or because there are legitimate use cases

[20:05:15.0239] <shu>
and so, it's fine to add withResolvers, even though it's explicitly against what we thought was the good default

[20:05:51.0139] <shu>
but the broader point is that that's the kind of argument i'm looking to hearing, not simply "developers use pattern X"

I have a question about calendars. The source map monthly call was on the TC39 calendar but I don't see it on there anymore. How can I go about adding it back? Do I make a personal event and then invite the calendar? Or do I need a special permission to do this?

[01:18:16.0682] <Michael Ficarra>
my understanding was that an event needs to be added to the private calendar first, and the public calendar is invited as an attendee of that event

[01:18:37.0120] <Michael Ficarra>
the public calendar has an email address to invite

[01:19:04.0106] <Michael Ficarra>
most of us regular-folk don't have permission to create such an event on the private calendar, though, so you should contact a chair or ljharb

I think this is the key point--despite many years passing, people are generally unaware both of the implied best practice and the fact that the promise constructor helps lead you to it, and on the other hand, the best practice is enforced by async/await. An illustration of the widespread lack of awareness is that no one even raised this concern in committee until you did, and without this awareness, people can't even really be expected to use the promise constructor in the way where it's helpful.

[02:48:48.0806] <Michael Ficarra>

But, yes this might be true

[02:52:44.0996] <bakkot>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> *should*

I think there's always going to tradeoffs in any representation, and a representation in which the second view of a buffer is expensive in exchange for the first view being faster is not obviously incorrect

[02:52:52.0890] <bakkot>

Luca Casonato: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-base64/issues/13 is the streaming issue, and https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-base64/issues/21 the one for encoding into an existing buffer

[02:55:56.0867] <bakkot>
the thing where you have a "prefix" argument to the one-shot API was my first suggestion, if I have understood correctly that this is what you were proposing; see response from justin in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-arraybuffer-base64/issues/13#issuecomment-911968641

re: streaming: I think, in general, it's vaguely best practice that primitives that deals with data should have zero-copy and streaming APIs for doing stuff with them. To me, the main question is whether there are valid use cases for doing base64 on a fairly big thing that can't fit in memory/packets all together. I don't know of such use cases/environments.

[03:01:47.0809] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>

yeah, not sure how ideal it is, but it's certainly not uncommon

[03:03:13.0457] <littledan>
I know but there's a certain limit on how big they can get, right?

[03:04:06.0984] <littledan>
also I don't think HTML has a streaming API to set the src of an img tag...

[03:04:14.0076] <tkopp>
there are a lot of APIs that don't handle binary data at all. You can only send e.g. images via encoding

[03:04:22.0509] <Luca Casonato>
bakkot: My suggestion was this: https://gist.github.com/lucacasonato/06a74fe2658fbe5a2d9c24cc767006c0

No need for any `extra` option on the static API. This performs at most 3 byte copies for every remainder. The code can be optimized further.

[03:05:01.0526] <Michael Ficarra>
at Shape, we one-shot base64 decode something like 150kb of bytecode on the main thread every page load

rbuckton: my personal opinion is that I'd like to investigate `Symbol.enter` but with what I know at this time, full context manager support seems excessive. I'd hesitate to speak for the committee, but that would be my recommendation

[03:10:50.0954] <tkopp>
soap APIs from transportation/shipping companies come to mind immediately.

[03:11:24.0800] <littledan>
great, I'd love to hear about your experience with these and how they relate to data size and streaming

[03:11:28.0671] <bakkot>
github rest API returns contents as base64-encoded strings

[03:11:54.0509] <bakkot>
for files up to 100MB in size

[03:14:52.0272] <bakkot>
actually I guess only up to 1MB; the API changes a bit for larger files

[03:14:56.0838] <Bradford Smith>
From my point of view Ron was just considering a related problem - how to make sure developers are nudged toward using the resource management features he's defining - and then coming up with a possible solution to this. He presented it as a possible follow-on proposal. DE seemed at first to be saying that this problem is important enough to force changes to the existing stage 3 proposal, but I think he's backed down from this. I think the conclusion is not to include such a feature in the current proposal.

[03:15:19.0969] <rbuckton>
I'll reiterate that I don't have an appetite for full context managers. They add a level of complexity that I'm not sure is suitable for ECMAScript, and they would have a negative impact on the ability for static type checkers like TypeScript to make reasonable assumptions about control flow due to ability for any context manager bound to a `using` to swallow an exception. 

[03:18:34.0245] <Bradford Smith>
Regarding the GC cleanup issue: I thought Ron was suggesting that engines could be encouraged to clean up any disposables that they themselves created (not every possible disposable) if they go out of scope without "leaking" anywhere else from the scope where they were created. 

[03:19:05.0387] <Bradford Smith>
just encouraged, not required

[03:19:37.0644] <rbuckton>
If we're not doing full context managers, then the goal of the proposed change would be to resolve a concern about "unused" disposables. That would be addressed by `Symbol.enter` without the need to introduce a `Symbol.asyncEnter`. `await using` would still verify/capture `[Symbol.asyncDispose]` as it does today, but would call `[Symbol.enter]()` synchronously without the need to introduce an extra `Await` at the declaration site. That would also avoid needing to rethink `AsyncDisposableStack.prototype.use` to handle the async case.

[03:20:18.0955] <Ashley Claymore>
for using `Symbol.enter` as a way for types to _enforce_ they are being assigned to `using`, could this also be done with `Symbol.dipose` setting a `userHasAcknoledgedLifetime` flag that either errors/warns if other methods are called without that flag set?

[03:20:24.0521] <bakkot>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> re: streaming: I think, in general, it's vaguely best practice that primitives that deals with data should have zero-copy and streaming APIs for doing stuff with them. To me, the main question is whether there are valid use cases for doing base64 on a fairly big thing that can't fit in memory/packets all together. I don't know of such use cases/environments.

it's not just about whether it all fits in memory; for example, one might reasonably stream base64'd wasm bytecode into WebAssembly.compileStreaming. the advantage of streaming in this case is that you can start doing work before waiting for the whole download to finish. which is nice!

[03:21:12.0270] <bakkot>
similarly, if you're uploading base64'd data to a server, you might do binary data -> compression stream -> base64 stream -> `fetch`; it's nice to be able to start the network request as early as possible

[03:21:43.0418] <Ashley Claymore>
my gut feeling is also that `DisposeStack.p.return` is a simpler API to explain that the enter/exit symbols.

Yes, a user-defined implementation could conceivably make `[Symbol.dispose]` a getter that indicates the method was at least read.

[03:21:58.0224] <rbuckton>

My intent was to state that as a remediation for an "unused" disposable, a host could leverage GC if necessary to ensure native handles don't leak, and that a user could use `FinalizationRegistry` to do the same. I worded it too strongly to expect that to always be the case, and that the outcome should be resource cleanup rather than a warning message like as what can happen for unhandled promise rejections. That wording was based on my prior experience with C#'s `IDisposable` and the C# team's recommendations to do likewise.

[03:25:24.0264] <Bradford Smith>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> Yes, a user-defined implementation could conceivably make `[Symbol.dispose]` a getter that indicates the method was at least read.

Personally, I think you're chasing an impossible goal here. The Explicit Resource Management proposal as-is provides a useful feature. There's no need to try so hard to force its correct use. Leave that problem for another day. Just my $0.02.

[03:26:04.0982] <rbuckton>
> <@aclaymore:matrix.org> sorry, `move`

`move` and `exit` are somewhat orthogonal to each other, so I'm not clear on the correlation you are making?

I concur. JavaScript itself can't reliably enforce lifetimes and ownership in the same way a language like Rust can, as that essentially requires a fully-baked runtime type system. Without that, we would be forced to take a major performance hit for every `var`/`let`/`const` declaration and every assignment to check or transfer ownership of an object's lifetime, which is a non-starter.

[03:29:21.0151] <Ashley Claymore>

Ah, thank you for the clarification.

[03:32:41.0219] <rbuckton>

Without that, we would be forced to take a major performance hit for every `var`/`let`/`const` declaration and every assignment to check or transfer ownership of an object's lifetime, which is a non-starter.

In a way, `DisposableStack.p.move` is a close approximation of Rust's `move` semantics as a way to "transfer ownership on assignment" similar to an affine type system, but in an imperative form:
```js
const stack1 = new DisposableStack();
...
const stack2 = stack1.move(); // stack1 can no longer be used, its contents have been moved to stack2.
...
const stack3 = stack2.move(); // stack2 can no longer be used, its contents have been moved to stack3.
```

[03:33:07.0184] <rbuckton>
(which is part of the reason for the choice of method name as well)

I agree. But if we did want to go in that direction, I think we should retract this proposal to Stage 2, as it's a big change and we don't have a concrete form of this yet.

[04:02:02.0069] <littledan>
I think we should conclude that we're not going in this Symbol.enter direction

[04:02:56.0606] <littledan>
this is just a very big thing to be considered an open question for a Stage 3 proposal

[04:05:24.0149] <rbuckton>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> I think we should conclude that we're not going in this Symbol.enter direction

nicolo-ribaudo's suggestion to make `[Symbol.dispose]` a getter if you want to opt-in to requiring the use of `using` or a `DisposableStack` holds water and may be satisfactory, without the need to introduce a new symbol-named method to the Disposable protocol: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management/issues/159#issuecomment-1630532470

I think the details of whether engines ship the Intl-only part separately or just together with Intl is something that we can leave to engines to decide. If an engine expects to take a really long time to do Temporal, they might do the Intl-only part. But Temporal should only ship with this included, and it'd be valid to ship at the same time. Within this, I think 2a would be the simplest way to organize the explanations.

[05:13:35.0779] <bakkot>
you do the downloading and so on right away but don't do the actual instantiation until you hit the `import` declaration

this does not seem hard to me?

[05:14:25.0720] <sffc>
> <@pchimento:igalia.com> that's what I was getting at, but I take Shu's point that that causes interoperability problems

ok, sorry for my misunderstanding

[05:14:46.0733] <nicolo-ribaudo>
And you cannot capture bindings from outside the import declaration? i.e.

```js
let buf = new ArrayBuffer()
import program from 'source.wasm' with { memory: buf } 
```

[05:15:27.0104] <bakkot>
no I am imagining that would work as written

[05:15:34.0819] <bakkot>
don't see why it shouldn't

[05:15:36.0398] <nicolo-ribaudo>
That could work with CJS where modules are evaluated before their dependencies, but with ESM `buf` does not exist until when all the imported modules are evaluated

[05:15:57.0130] <bakkot>
there are multiple notions of "evaluated" wrt wasm

[05:16:38.0994] <bakkot>
the obvious thing for it to do is to download the thing but not actually instantiate until you hit the import declaration, at which point `buf` is available

[05:16:57.0949] <shu>
what is "hit the import declaration"

[05:17:16.0348] <bakkot>
like, get to that line in the program

[05:17:17.0321] <Michael Ficarra>
evaluation semantics for an ImportDeclaration

[05:18:16.0737] <shu>
the import declaration is just parsed and collected and processed ahead of time right now, it's not even in the compiled AST

[05:18:20.0578] <shu>
i don't think import has evaluation does it

[05:18:31.0659] <shu>
like we could add it but that seems a radical departure from what it does right now

[05:18:48.0162] <shu>
 * the import declaration is just parsed and collected and processed ahead of time right now, it's not even in the AST sent to the compiler

[05:18:56.0784] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Also, import declarations are hoisted. Capturing from inside them has the same problems discussed for function declaration decorators

[05:19:06.0607] <bakkot>
to be clear I am not super-seriously proposing this

[05:19:17.0483] <bakkot>
I agree the hoisting is annoying technically

[05:19:28.0278] <bakkot>
however, no real program relies on hoisting import declarations, because that's batshit

[05:19:29.0807] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Also to be clear, I also hope we'll have direct imports for wasm one day

[05:19:47.0291] <bakkot>
so it still feels like the code sample above should just work as written

[05:20:03.0047] <ljharb>
hm, can you `class extends AbstractModuleSource { }` if it's not constructable or callable?

[05:20:13.0416] <shu>
i don't understand the spec draft as written

[05:20:14.0554] <littledan>
if you use direct Wasm imports, then that Wasm module can import a memory from a different ESM module that explicitly constructs it.

[05:20:16.0379] <bakkot>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> however, no real program relies on hoisting import declarations, because that's batshit

Well, you don't write mutually recursive imports

[05:21:21.0031] <shu>
oh i misunderstood the point

[05:21:34.0201] <shu>
not that nobody relies on the hoisting function semantics, but the hoisting import semantics that are like the hoisting function semantics

[05:21:36.0090] <littledan>
It's pretty common to use function hoisting in a sillier way, like

```js
foo.onbar = fn;
function fn() { }
```

In fact, fear of breaking this particular pattern is what's holding back function decorators

[05:21:51.0062] <bakkot>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> not that nobody relies on the hoisting function semantics, but the hoisting import semantics that are like the hoisting function semantics

right exactly

[05:21:54.0218] <littledan>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> not that nobody relies on the hoisting function semantics, but the hoisting import semantics that are like the hoisting function semantics

anyway yes this is how import statements work

[05:22:21.0767] <bakkot>
concretely, no one writes an `import` declaration at the bottom of a file and code which runs right away which uses a binding from the `import` at the top of the file

[05:22:22.0907] <Michael Ficarra>

This is resolved by the Wasm subclass behavior

[05:23:28.0229] <shu>
how can you resolve that in the subclass behavior

[05:23:52.0796] <shu>
what installs the brand?

[05:23:58.0826] <littledan>
the cyclic module record superclass throws; the wasm module subclass does another thing

[05:24:11.0493] <littledan>
it's installed when parsing the Wasm module, by construction

sillier? This is a common practice in the TS codebase, i.e.:
```ts
function createFoo() {
  const quxx = ...;

  return {
    bar,
    baz,
  };

  function bar() { ... }
  function baz() { ... }
}
```

[05:25:09.0966] <shu>
how does that interface with %AbstractModuleSource%

[05:25:42.0504] <nicolo-ribaudo>

[05:26:19.0464] <nicolo-ribaudo>

Sorry, me

[05:26:24.0134] <ljharb>
that seems like a problem

[05:26:49.0912] <littledan>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> someone is typing loudly again

did it stop for you?

[05:26:53.0920] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Do y'all think that throwing only if constructed directly would be an acceptable solution?

[05:27:07.0450] <ljharb>
that works for me

[05:27:11.0211] <nicolo-ribaudo>

(I do not remember why we throw)

 * that works for me, based on new.target or something

[05:27:15.0532] <bakkot>

it has stopped now yes

[05:28:06.0095] <Michael Ficarra>
nicolo-ribaudo: yes, that is what we suggested here: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3094#discussion_r1230304753

[05:28:48.0752] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I'm trying to find references as to why we introduced the throwing behavior in the first place

[05:29:27.0069] <littledan>
if there's no JS-exposed API for setting that internal brand slot (e.g., a super constructor parameter), then the constructor isn't very useful

[05:29:32.0848] <littledan>
whether or not it throws

[05:30:01.0191] <ljharb>
hm, that is true

[05:30:12.0103] <ljharb>
it seems important to be able to self-host in JS tho

[05:30:34.0546] <littledan>
to me this feels like something that's OK to unconditionally throw "for now" with a hope that we expand this out soon (maybe in the context of compartments)

[05:31:07.0558] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> it seems important to be able to self-host in JS tho

Without custom module loading you cannot self-host modules anyway

[05:31:28.0024] <ljharb>
you could with on-the-fly source rewriting, no?

[05:31:40.0321] <littledan>
"instantiable" would be a name reflecting intuition? I think this sounds just vaguely computer-y.

[05:31:43.0042] <ljharb>
 * you could with on-the-fly source rewriting, no? i don't mean virtualization which indeed would require custom module loading

[05:32:21.0074] <Michael Ficarra>

If you're rewriting source, why do you care about using a real source object at all?

[05:32:41.0845] <Michael Ficarra>
 * the existing names are fine

[05:32:46.0999] <Ashley Claymore>
'source' is much easier to write and spell than 'instantiable'

[05:33:00.0024] <ljharb>
> <@littledan:matrix.org> If you're rewriting source, why do you care about using a real source object at all?

because user code would still need to interact with the resulting source phase object

[05:33:23.0352] <littledan>

[05:33:37.0807] <danielrosenwasser>

The good news is this is a power-user feature with a keyword that can get auto-completed

[05:34:23.0786] <ljharb>

anything that's observable. i don't have a use case except that a self-hosted implementation should be able to be made indistinguishable from a C++ one

hopefully often enough to warrant this proposal advancing

I think for JS developers, yes

[05:45:27.0048] <ljharb>
what are the "phases" identified for modules during this process? like what comes after "source"

[05:45:35.0152] <bakkot>
but if you are a Go programmer, you are going to want to write Go, and then a small JS wrapper to let the Go program interact with the webapp

[05:45:42.0015] <shu>
`raw` is worse than `source` for the same confusion, yeah

[05:45:51.0136] <bakkot>
and the way you do that is, you compile the Go to wasm, and then import the wasm from a JS module

[05:45:55.0690] <littledan>
honestly `import compiled` captures things well for Wasm (or `import parsed`??), but I'm not sure if it will be intuitive.

[05:47:39.0809] <nicolo-ribaudo>

KKL has a proposal for JS sources

[05:47:57.0460] <nicolo-ribaudo>
To do reflection on them, as well as custom linking

[05:48:02.0875] <bakkot>
ah, right

[05:48:11.0560] <bakkot>
and to bypass CSP I guess

I think this was the original world in the proposal, but there are two use cases (custom instantiation and reflection) and it only covers one

[05:50:07.0925] <Rob Palmer>
`import fetched`

[05:50:31.0529] <bakkot>
`fetched` also suggests just raw bytes to me

the Racket programming language uses "syntax" to refer to data that has been parsed -- ranging from simple expressions like `42` to entire modules -- but not yet evaluated

[06:44:02.0837] <yulia | Back in October>
Mikhail Barash is really great to work with, I've really enjoyed collaborating with the students at Bergen. Would love to join myself next year if we can do a plenary there again. 

[06:44:15.0500] <yulia | Back in October>
my overlord is calling, i have to run.

[06:44:16.0985] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
Hoping we can improve our relationships with all of our researcher colleagues and utilize academic techniques to analyze proposals in addition to everything we do now

[06:44:48.0986] <yulia | Back in October>
enjoy the plenary everyone!

[06:48:07.0455] <yulia | Back in October>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> i understand Yulia's original claim to be "ESM performance story is not viable without this feature"

 * \<still on leave, may not be able to actually answer here later> I wouldn't say it isn't viable, thats maybe too broad. a web code base can be entirely rewritten just for performance gains, at the cost of developing new features etc. But what we have found is that the rewriting of applications is unrealistic, and this stops people from moving to modules all together. In addition, this doesn't work so well when we consider non-web js applications, such as a good portion of the FX codebase, where we cannot use loading techniques such as module-preload

ugh the web zoom client like pauses the video if i background the tab i think

[06:58:05.0411] <shu>
and it can't recover

the web zoom client is terrible

 * does corp policy let you use parallels? you could have a mac in your mac and install zoom on the guest mac

[07:00:23.0102] <shu>

(I know this is an unproductive discussion, sorry)

[07:06:57.0498] <Michael Ficarra>

 * dminor: they are talking about our proposed normalisation and omission of Infinity/NaN

[07:07:21.0248] <littledan>
but it's Waldemar who wants normalization...

[07:07:26.0954] <littledan>
I think the coercion with numbers is just an error

IEEE standards are paywalled?

[07:07:45.0708] <Michael Ficarra>
I am skeptical about the perf claims, there mostly isn't hardware acceleration for Decimal128 yet

[07:07:58.0391] <dminor>
Ok, so is this IEEE 754 decimal128 or not?

[07:07:58.0526] <Michael Ficarra>
so no matter what, you're implementing it using integer maths

[07:08:36.0216] <Michael Ficarra>
*mostly*

[07:09:25.0756] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
but these implementations could improve perf over time as hardware acceleration crops up

[07:10:03.0881] <littledan>
dminor: Yes, the idea is that we'd use IEEE Decimal128

[07:10:57.0460] <Chris de Almeida>
> <@usharma:igalia.com> IEEE standards are paywalled?

yes...  are you looking for something?  `<laughs in hidden>`

[07:12:10.0509] <Michael Ficarra>
where did it say that decimals have object identity?

[07:13:22.0821] <shu>
it doesn't have operator overloading

[07:13:50.0892] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I thought the operator overloading discussion was about math operators

[07:14:01.0911] <shu>
=== is an operator

[07:14:34.0380] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Yeah for some reason I never realized it was part of that discussion

[07:14:36.0026] <ljharb>
oh oof, it wouldn't be a primitive?

[07:14:42.0939] <shu>
nope

[07:14:47.0596] <ljharb>
i don't see any point in doing a number system if it's not a primitive

[07:15:17.0518] <Michael Ficarra>
defining behaviour for `===` does not mean operator overloading

[07:15:33.0606] <Michael Ficarra>
operator overloading means deferring to some user code, no?

[07:15:45.0985] <chipmorningstar>
What about `+`?

[07:15:50.0120] <shu>
in this context it means overloading existing syntax operators

[07:15:55.0347] <Chris de Almeida>
It's dangerous to go alone!  Take this.

[07:15:57.0570] <shu>
not necessarily user code

[07:16:00.0196] <Michael Ficarra>
defining behaviour for maths operators does not mean operator overloading

[07:16:14.0515] <ljharb>
i also understand the term "operator overloading" to mean for user code

[07:16:19.0094] <shu>
the constraint from engines is we don't want to add new paths to operators

[07:16:27.0992] <shu>
what phrase should be used for that constraint?

[07:16:40.0439] <Rob Palmer>
"builtin operator overloading"

[07:16:42.0767] <ljharb>
that position effectively kills a bunch of useful proposals, including decimal, imo

[07:16:45.0921] <shu>
where operator includes all operators, `+` and `===` etc

[07:16:49.0485] <Michael Ficarra>
shu: no new primitives

[07:16:53.0347] <rbuckton>
there's a distinction between user-defined operator overloading and the fact that JS operators are overloaded. Currently they are overloaded based on type and coercion (i.e., string, number, bigint)

[07:17:08.0824] <ljharb>
if "no new primitives" is the stance from engines i'd love to see some kind of public statement to that effect

[07:17:24.0353] <ljharb>
because we need something to point the massive mob of angry JS devs to

[07:17:36.0263] <shu>
it's no new primitives unless vastly compelling

[07:17:50.0400] <Michael Ficarra>
then decimal is dead in the water

[07:17:52.0978] <shu>
if you publicize it it will be taken outside of context as a standalone fiat

[07:18:04.0840] <ljharb>
i don't understand how R&T and Decimal aren't both vastly compelling - if neither of those hit the bar then that's the same as "no new primitives"

[07:18:26.0219] <shu>
you and i disagree

[07:18:26.0646] <ljharb>
 * i don't understand how R&T and Decimal aren't both vastly compelling - if neither of those hit the bar then that's the same as "no new primitives" imo

[07:18:32.0055] <rbuckton>
My understanding is that the position of implementers regarding "no new primitives" is due to implementation complexity, not whether they would fit within the spec itself?

[07:19:00.0049] <shu>
it's complexity and performance in the engine itself, yes

[07:19:01.0435] <ljharb>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> you and i disagree

that's fine, but i think it's important to get a sense from the wider JS community about this sort of thing

[07:19:06.0519] <Michael Ficarra>
we may as well pack up and go home, language is done folks

[07:19:12.0264] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
"vastly compelling" always subjective. There's almost no public JS event I've been to where nobody was lamenting IEEE doubles.

[07:20:37.0326] <rbuckton>
> <@usharma:igalia.com> "vastly compelling" always subjective. There's almost no public JS event I've been to where nobody was lamenting IEEE doubles.

Hard to parse double negatives...do you mean to say "every public JS event I've been to there was always someone lamenting IEEE doubles"? or that no one is complaining about it?

[07:20:49.0525] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
sorry, yes

[07:21:10.0189] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
I meant that I'm almost bored of hearing people criticize how we do `Number`s

[07:21:20.0412] <Rob Palmer>
I'm assuming @ljharb is wondering how we can surface data for cases where significant developer demand exists, such that it would justify implementation burden that would otherwise be intolerable.  I don't think he is encouraging mass pile-ons and pitchforks.

[07:21:28.0463] <ljharb>
exactly that

[07:21:54.0254] <ljharb>
but also, there WILL be massive pileons and pitchforks if we hide the actual position of browsers behind TC39 notes

[07:21:54.0354] <shu>
we literally do not know how to get high-quality signal for web developers, the closest we come is scaled surveys

[07:22:07.0497] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
I think the priority of constituencies is a reasonable solution

[07:22:09.0323] <Michael Ficarra>
well maybe a couple of pitchforks

[07:22:25.0702] <ljharb>
make a joint public statement from browsers saying decimals and R&T are effectively dead because "no new primitives" and why, and i suspect you will quickly get signal from web developers. whether it's high-quality is ofc another matter.

[07:22:49.0676] <Christian Ulbrich>
What amount of developer demand would convince an implementor, that an implementation is worth the burden?

[07:23:18.0247] <ljharb>
i would hope that's something an implementor feels obligated to answer

[07:23:43.0619] <Michael Ficarra>
even if we go by V8's statement yesterday about encouraging features that will make better user experiences, decimal is incredibly justified because web users will have better experiences when they get correct numeric results!

[07:27:13.0304] <shu>
> <@christianulbrich:matrix.org> What amount of developer demand would convince an implementor, that an implementation is worth the burden?

as i said yesterday, developer demand is not convincing in itself, but in a larger context it could add color. for example, if a proposal does not pose significant complexity (which is really about security) concerns, then developer demand tips the scale for me and V8 to support

[07:27:32.0164] <Bradford Smith>
"Do it in the backend" doesn't help if the backend is Node.js

[07:27:48.0349] <rbuckton>
This statement presupposes that "the backend" is not NodeJS and "the frontend" is not Electron

[07:29:33.0473] <Bradford Smith>
I may have missed this: Did the presentation include pointers to one or more known-good userland libraries for this?

[07:30:13.0807] <Michael Ficarra>
Bradford Smith: yes, the champion made one himself

[07:30:25.0668] <Michael Ficarra>
and linked to it from the slides

[07:30:44.0436] <dminor>
I don't question that this would be useful in node.js, but that doesn't convince me that this needs to baked into the language.

[07:30:47.0969] <Rob Palmer>
We have a huge amount of financial processing happening on the client-side.  Common untransformed data is multi-cast to many users with low-latency.  Lots of per-client per-window per-widget customized calculations happens on the client side.

[07:33:09.0110] <littledan>
JS itself even has decimal processing on the client side (in Intl.NumberFormat, on strings when rounding options are used)

[07:33:18.0217] <ptomato (at TC39, limited availability)>
there's also http://mikemcl.github.io/big.js/ from the same author

while I empathize with the calls to stick to IEEE at all costs (and I believe we will), I'm afraid this view is representative of a majority of JS developers

[07:34:51.0723] <littledan>
I just don't understand the details of the claim that this proposal deviates from IEEE 754 decimal. I'd like to follow up on those in a more concrete way. The intention is to use IEEE 754.

[07:35:10.0317] <shu>
if we're going by developer anecdotes, i'd wager majority of js developers also just do not care about JS semantics either

[07:35:58.0256] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
fair, but the point I'm trying to make is that there's a strong signal that this is really popular among users

[07:37:03.0054] <Michael Ficarra>
devs are going to think we're incompetent and out of touch if we tell them decimals are not sufficiently justified

[07:37:25.0955] <littledan>
https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9486

[07:37:45.0104] <shu>
Michael Ficarra: specifically do you mean "decimals as primitives"

[07:38:22.0645] <ljharb>
decimals you can use === and other basic operators with

[07:38:31.0981] <Michael Ficarra>
if we have decimals as non-primitives, they will just think they're clunky

[07:38:44.0362] <ljharb>
most JS devs won't care or necessarily know about primitives vs objects but they *will* care about all the things "being primitives" lets them do

[07:39:27.0097] <ljharb>
and without being primitives, what's the value over just using a library

[07:39:43.0766] <ljharb>
 * and without being primitives, what's the value over just using a library - "i don't have to install it" imo is far far weaker than "it's more ergonomic"

[07:39:47.0765] <shu>
so is that "yes" to my question?

[07:39:48.0040] <Michael Ficarra>
ljharb: literal syntax

[07:40:26.0745] <Michael Ficarra>
shu: no, I think they will have different, but still negative, feelings about us

[07:40:37.0720] <Christian Ulbrich>
@shu I think so, they need to be first-class citizen, i.e. Primitives, with everything that entails, I am afraid.

[07:41:12.0791] <shu>
our position stands, and i've articulated as our not being convinced against the complexity (security) and performance tradeoffs

[07:41:56.0719] <ljharb>
and what i asked was that that position be stated somewhere publicly, outside of tc39, so it can be cited when making proposal decisions

[07:42:09.0485] <ljharb>
 * and what i asked/suggested was that that position be stated somewhere publicly, outside of tc39, so it can be cited when making proposal decisions

[07:42:37.0876] <rbuckton>
I mean, how useful would it be to have actual integer primitives like `int8` , `int16`, `int32`, `uint32`, etc. with proper overflow checking? Current approaches to constrain values to a specific integer space are often complex, such that we end up needing to add static methods to `Math` for proper integer division because all we have is Number.

 * and what i asked/suggested was that that position be stated somewhere publicly, outside of tc39, so it can be cited when making proposal decisions (for the benefit of the wider JS dev community)

[07:42:41.0163] <shu>
i am not a PR person, i am a standards person

[07:43:01.0157] <ljharb>
there is considerable overlap there, i suspect

[07:43:06.0778] <shu>
not for me

[07:43:28.0270] <ljharb>
i would hope for v8/chrome, though?

[07:43:39.0337] <shu>
to explain our standards positions to the general public? no

[07:43:44.0935] <ljharb>
wow, ok

[07:43:45.0454] <shu>
to explain our standards positions to stakeholders? yes

[07:43:46.0948] <ljharb>
that's surprising

[07:43:53.0331] <ljharb>
the general public are all stakeholders.

> <@ljharb:matrix.org> and without being primitives, what's the value over just using a library - "i don't have to install it" imo is far far weaker than "it's more ergonomic"

I agree with your position on Decimal pretty much, but I do think "I don't have to install it" is a huge motivation for serving the majority of the world's population that accesses websites on an unstable or metered internet connection

[07:45:33.0267] <Michael Ficarra>
true, it is justified for *many* reasons

[07:52:23.0754] <shu>
to be clear i don't mean that we wish to make standards positions _private_, i mean that i don't consider it my job to _publicize_

There is precedent in that `/test/ === /test/` is false, but yeah, it is weird

[08:17:51.0148] <Christian Ulbrich>
There are other things, with `NaN === NaN` only being the most prominent one, but `[] === []`... are also not equal :) As are Dates...

[08:20:27.0392] <ljharb>
It‚Äôs not that syntax always means triple equals, but that the oddities are known and minimal and shouldn‚Äôt be increased.

[08:34:13.0160] <shu>
interesting point about regexps having creation syntax but have Object semantics

[08:35:03.0136] <shu>
but numeric literals having Object semantics feels it is unprecedented in all of PL. would be fascinating to see an exception

[08:42:22.0337] <Jesse (TC39)>
> <@eemeli:mozilla.org> Re: the Decimal proposal, do I understand right that as currently proposed `1.0m === 1.0m` would be `false`, yes? That's... weird.

indeed -- it's a bullet one would bite if you accept the "no overloading" approach. I'm happy to discuss whether we should make an exception for `===`

[08:43:34.0386] <Jesse (TC39)>
i.e., make `===` be numerical equality when both lhs and rhs are `Decimal`s

[08:44:09.0396] <nicolo-ribaudo>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> but numeric literals having Object semantics feels it is unprecedented in all of PL. would be fascinating to see an exception

I would rather not use JS as the language for "nobody does this so let's try to see how weird it will be!"

[08:52:19.0065] <shu>
me neither?

[08:52:44.0645] <shu>
that was not a "would be fascinating for JS to do this as an exception", that was a "it would be fascinating to see prior art, i don't believe it exists"

[08:55:01.0196] <shu>
> <@jesse:igalia.com> i.e., make `===` be numerical equality when both lhs and rhs are `Decimal`s

i would not support this

[08:57:33.0853] <Jesse (TC39)>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> i would not support this

understood -- the "no overloading" philosophy (which I still stand by) tries to respect that

[09:00:47.0695] <Jesse (TC39)>
in `C#` (a language that has decimals natively), you use a `cmp` function (returns -1, 0, or 1), which is also what I have in my current proposal. No `===`

ah ok, thanks, didn't know üëçÔ∏è

[09:05:03.0817] <rbuckton>
In C#, all primitives are "value types" that are essentially defined as `struct`s, and all operations on these types flows through operator overloading. Since C# is a typed language, it determines which static operator method to bind at compile time so that the runtime cost is negligible, though for a number of built in operations those can also generate native code that is faster than the overload method.

We had a number of discussions about user-defined operator overloading a few years back. The thought at the time was that you would need to have some kind of syntactic opt-in to inform the runtime that it should consider operator overloads. The upside being that existing code wouldn't be effected by the cost associated with operator overloads, the downside being that it would be fairly easy to forget to include the syntax, especially if you are working with a value that is returned from a function defined in a different module.

It was something like `with operators from Foo` to opt into using operators defined on a constructor, IIRC.

I'd hoped that we could tie operator overloading to something like `struct`, such that an implementation might have an easy way to recognize whether to even consider an overloaded operator (so it doesn't need to consider operator overloads for all other types), but that doesn't look to be viable with the direction we're going.

[09:18:04.0027] <rbuckton>
Alternatively, something similar we could use to tag an instance as opting-in to operator overloads like a `value class C {}` or something to that effect.

It doesn‚Äôt quite have to be your job to publicize it as such, but if you could give us (proponents of features) direction on what to say to others when they ask us about this, so as to accurately represent your position, that would be helpful. The scope of what you would like JS proposals to avoid has been a little ambiguous even to many committee members leading up to this meeting.

> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> it's so strange to me that IETF would explicitly *not* want to support sub-minute offsets

(catching up) Here's more context around IETF's reasoning, and more generally why restricting offset time zones to minutes seems OK to me:

Existing RFC3339 timestamp strings (which the new IETF spec, aka "IXDTF", extends) only support HH:MM in the offset, e.g. `2023-07-12T14:06-07:00`. You can't use `07:00:01` or even `07:00:00` because parsers wouldn't recognize it. JS Date has the same same limit, BTW. 

In the new IETF spec, they didn't want to change anything about the RFC3339 portion of the IXDTF timestamp, only the stuff in brackets after the timestamp is what's new.  Otherwise, existing RFC3339 parsers would break for the before-brackets portion. Of course, that's not necessarily related to what's in brackets. We could have different precision for the in-brackets portion because there's no legacy.

But with IXDTF, the rule is that the RFC3339 offset must match the offset of the time zone in brackets.  So `2020-01-01T00:00-05:00[America /Los_Angeles]` is considered an error because the offset doesn't match the time zone.

For named time zones that have sub-minute precision, the new IETF spec handles it by being flexible about what "match" means: if the bracketed time zone's offset, when rounded to HH:MM, matches the offset in the RFC3339 portion of the string, then there's no error produced. 

So `1970-01-01T00:00-00:45[Africa/Monrovia]` is considered valid, even though Liberia's offset in 1970 was -00:44:30. The rounding hack simply tells the receiver not to throw an error in that case; it doesn't change the actual instant that the string represents. The instant described by "midnight on Jan 1 1970 in Liberia" is still 44:30 away from UNIX epoch: 
```js
Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('1970-01-01T00:00-00:45[Africa/Monrovia]').toInstant();
// => 1970-01-01T00:44:30Z
```

Temporal does the same thing in reverse in `ZonedDateTime.p.toString()`: it formats the instant by rounding the offset to the nearest minute.

Anyway, that's how it works for named time zones. But what about offset time zones? 

Because the offset in the RFC3339 portion of the string is constrained to HH:MM, the IETF folks felt that it'd be better to also limit the bracketed time zone to HH:MM too. There's nothing preventing us from extending the format in the future if there's customer demand, using the same rounding hack used for named time zones, so that `1970-01-01T00:00-00:45[-00:44:30]` would also be allowed.

But it's not clear (to me at least) that this customer demand will ever materialize. Offset time zones were really only added to Temporal and IXDTF for backwards compatibility with Java. It's not clear how much usage of offset time zones there will be in Temporal. Partly this is because all IANA time zones today are on 15-minute boundaries. Sub-minute offsets haven't been official in any country since the 1970s, and even then it was rare. And offset time zones intentionally dispense with the main value of time zones in Temporal: the ability to automatically adjust timestamps for DST and other time zone weirdness.

Also, there's a storage advantage. If offset time zones are limited to minutes, then a Temporal.TimeZone can fit in a 16-bit union: 12 bits for offset time zones (¬±24h at minute-precision), 10 bits for the index into ~600 named time zones, and one bit to choose between them. Sub-minute offsets would require 50% more bytes to support a use case with questionable demand.

Finally, any user who really needs an offset time zone with sub-minute precision can create a custom time zone with granularity down to nanoseconds. Which they'd have to do anyways for time zones like TAI which don't have constant offsets (thanks leap seconds!) so you can't use an offset time zone anyways. AFAICT, there has never been a real-world time zone that has had a non-minute-aligned offset whose offset has never changed.  So I'm kinda skeptical that "offset time zones at sub-minute precision" are real things.

P.S. - one concern raised was how RFC 5545 (aka iCalendar) supports [second-precision offsets](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.14). But AFAICT, those offsets are never actually used for time zone identifiers. Rather, they're used to define the offsets of named time zones. And Temporal is already permissive with timestamp offset inputs, so we'll accept strings like `1970-01-01T00:00-00:44:30` which AFAICT is what RFC5545 needs. 

Summary: restricting to minutes for built-in offset time zones seems like a safe initial bet that we can always extend later if needed.

> <@sffc:mozilla.org> It still seems like we should stop returning Saigon and Kiev despite the lack of a Temporal.TimeZone.prototype.equals

There are two pieces required to fully solve this: 
1. Stop canonicalizing user-inputted IDs to canonical IDs that are sometimes outdated and/or varying across browsers.  By bringing proposal-canonical-tz to Stage 3 and merging it into Temporal, this problem gets solved as soon as Temporal.TimeZone ships in implementations. Yay!
2. Stop using outdated canonical IDs. Today this affects all IDs, but after (1) is done this will only affect IDs generated by ECMAScript itself, e.g. `new Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` and `Intl.supportedValuesOf('timeZone')`.

These two pieces are independent!  Even though yesterday the committee agreed to hold (1) until Temporal.TimeZone ships, for (2) implementations are already free to return Europe/Kyiv, Asia/Kolkata, and Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh as canonical IDs. Firefox does this today, and Anba has argued (convincingly, IMO) that the FF behavior is more spec-compliant with current 402.

V8 and JSC don't do this today because they rely on CLDR and ICU which never update renamed IDs.  But nothing stops ICU-using implementations from doing what Firefox does and overriding the ~20 zones in CLDR that use out-of-date names. If an ICU solution will take 2 years, could V8 and JSC in the meantime just add a hard-coded mapping table of 20 IDs?  It's not like renames happen often: less than once per year is the average. If you, shu , and Frank wanted to do this badly enough, I suspect it could get done fast!

That said, it's a reasonable argument that doing (1) before (2), or at the same time, would reduce the negative impact to existing code because user-inputted zones wouldn't be affected.

My suggestion:
* Let's get implementations building & shipping Temporal!  After this plenary's normative changes are merged within a week or two, AFAIK there are no other large changes on the horizon.
* IMO, V8 and JSC should really consider the 20-item hard-coded mapping table to work around CLDR's slow schedule. Could this work be paired with Temporal implementation instead of waiting until later? Could this work start now, and ship in a limited test to gauge the web-compat impact?

Let me know how I can help!

Good catch. You're right, the rounding is a Temporal solution, not something in the IETF spec. Let's discuss among the Temporal champions whether it's wroth trying to get this into the IETF spec, or whether it's too niche for us to care about pushing it into that spec.

the `new` example should be `new a?.()`

[02:11:45.0644] <littledan>
I thought the example `new a?.b()` should already be legal (but would not be so useful)

[02:12:45.0429] <eemeli>
Do we have any valid syntax yet that considers the LHS in any way before attempting evaluation of the RHS?

[02:14:55.0013] <bakkot>
`(a.b) = c` being legal is an accident of history

[02:15:05.0739] <rbuckton>
```js
a = { b: x };
a = ({ b: x });
( { b: x } = a );
( ({ b: x }) = a ); // does not work
```

[02:15:10.0106] <bakkot>
we made `([x]) = b` illegal

[02:15:14.0833] <rbuckton>
so we are not consistent in all assignment cases

[02:19:25.0616] <Andreu Botella>
You can also treat this as being precedence-related, right?

[02:19:35.0710] <Andreu Botella>
whether `?.` is prioritized over `=`

[02:19:35.0846] <bakkot>
not with the example on screen, no

Andreu Botella: no?

[02:19:44.0260] <HE Shi-Jun>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> `(a.b) = c` being legal is an accident of history

yeah, it's strange. Much strange that we support `(a.b)=c` but not `(test?a:b)=c` which was supported in some other languages.  

[02:19:47.0898] <Michael Ficarra>
Andreu Botella: definitely not

[02:20:31.0090] <rbuckton>
Its easy enough to say that `(a?.b)` is not a valid simple assignment target

[02:20:53.0616] <Michael Ficarra>
HE Shi-Jun: you're right, that is a strange inconsistency

[02:22:14.0357] <bakkot>
we could say `a?.b = c` is only legal in statement position

[02:22:17.0555] <rbuckton>
syntactically `a?.b = c` would likely be an _OptionalChainAssignment_, where the `?.b = c = d = 42` is part of the chain

[02:22:18.0361] <bakkot>
that would be kind of odd but like

[02:22:18.0800] <bakkot>
fine

[02:22:37.0499] <HE Shi-Jun>
`a = b.x = c?.y = d = e = 42;` this case is interesting, what's the behavior as current draft?

[02:23:18.0227] <rbuckton>
If you translate this example to the "setter-function" case, it is consistent:
```js
a = b.x = c?.setY(d = e = 42);
```
would produce `undefined`

[02:24:15.0332] <rbuckton>
 * If you translate this example to the "setter-function" case, it is consistent:

```js
a = b.x = c?.setY(d = e = 42);
```

would assign `undefined` to `a` and `b.x`

[02:24:16.0928] <HE Shi-Jun>
so `a` and `b.x` would be `undefined` instead of `42`? ü§î

[02:24:21.0690] <rbuckton>
yes

[02:24:54.0980] <rbuckton>
maybe weaker than Statement and only at `,`

[02:25:09.0985] <rbuckton>
 * maybe weaker than Statement and allow at `,`

[02:25:16.0255] <rbuckton>
 * maybe weaker than Statement and allow at `,`?

[02:25:22.0234] <bakkot>
yeah, that also works

[02:25:34.0224] <bakkot>
really anywhere except the RHS of an assignment expression

[02:26:07.0666] <bakkot>
though, if the goal is to avoid observing the value, you do want "only in statement position" probably

[02:26:28.0097] <nicolo-ribaudo>
The goal is to "accidentally" observe the value

[02:26:31.0974] <rbuckton>
It should be feasible to forbid `a = b?.x = c` in the grammar

[02:26:39.0808] <bakkot>
`x = (0, a?.b = c)` assigns what value to `x`? `undefined` or `c`?

[02:26:43.0750] <nicolo-ribaudo>
i.e. something like `a = (b?.c = d)` might still be ok

[02:26:55.0780] <nicolo-ribaudo>
 * i.e. something like `a = (b?.c = d)` might still be ok, assigning undefined

[02:29:38.0458] <rbuckton>
Not sure I want `a?.b = c` where `c` is evaluated if `a` is undefined. The point is to avoid the evaluation of `c` if it isn't going to be used, otherwise it is not a valid refactor from `if (a) a.b = c`

We want to allow `a?.b = c` where its on the LHS, but disallow `a = b?.c = d` where its on the LHS and RHS, but not disallow `a = b?.c`. Possible with production parameters maybe, especially if the assignment is part of the _OptionalChain_ production

Agreed. We really should've explicitly gone for stage-1 for Intl.MessageFormat a couple of years earlier, when the work in its WG started under Unicode.

production parameter works, yes - have a new [IsStatement] flag or whatever, present only on AssignmentExpression, and then Expression sets the flag and no other use of AssignmentExpression sets it

[02:56:05.0999] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>

re: `do` expressions, I think some proposals like pattern matching are depending on it.

[03:04:49.0219] <rbuckton>
not to say that they can't work around that.

[03:04:50.0389] <bakkot>
yeah, though pattern matching is even more syntax than `do` is

[03:04:58.0671] <bakkot>
it is so much syntax

[03:05:20.0270] <rbuckton>
pattern matching is extremely valuable though, and I think is definitely worth its weight.

[03:05:39.0996] <bakkot>
yeah I'm not saying any of these things shouldn't be pursued, considered in isolation (except maybe pipeline)

[03:05:41.0428] <ptomato (at TC39, limited availability)>
which implementations have cleanupSome anyway? I don't think it works in most of them, at least not unflagged

[03:05:55.0730] <bakkot>
just that I think the community would be better served by us focusing on stdlib stuff over syntax, at the margin

[03:06:01.0181] <ptomato (at TC39, limited availability)>
it may well be that the test262 infrastructure that uses cleanupSome, was only added for testing cleanupSome

I believe HE Shi-Jun was interested in championing the `function.sent` proposal

[03:07:00.0329] <Andreu Botella>
that test doesn't seem to be specifically for `cleanupSome`

[03:07:16.0690] <Andreu Botella>
and it uses `asyncGC`, which uses `cleanupSome` internally

[03:07:30.0527] <bakkot>
it does kind of claim to be testing `cleanupSome`?

[03:07:36.0953] <bakkot>
at least, that's what the `info` section has

[03:07:55.0926] <Andreu Botella>
it includes `cleanupSome` in the features it uses, because otherwise test262 and maybe other engines will not pass the right flags

[03:08:06.0865] <Andreu Botella>
but I don't think it is testing `cleanupSome`

[03:08:22.0202] <Andreu Botella>
I might be wrong though

[03:08:33.0516] <ptomato (at TC39, limited availability)>
well that's what I meant by my original question - I suspect that most/all consumers of test262 might just never run this test

rbuckton: re: `throw`; it occurs to me that possibly

```
ThrowExpression: `throw` AssignmentExpression [lookahead ‚â† ,]
```
might also work?

[03:12:36.0203] <bakkot>
in combination with a `[lookahead ‚â† Throw]` restriction in `ExpressionStatement`, to avoid ambiguity

[03:13:15.0865] <bakkot>
it's a little bit weird, but I think it avoids the `throw a, b` problem

[03:14:22.0374] <bakkot>
and lookahead restrictions at the end of productions are precedented in `IfStatement`

[03:15:02.0238] <rbuckton>
That could work, and is far simpler than what I was thinking, though it does mean that _ThrowStatement_ and _ThrowExpression_ wouldn't be symmetrical.

[03:15:24.0189] <bakkot>
yeah, but you only notice the asymmetry as an author (or implementer), not as a reader

[03:15:54.0800] <bakkot>
since as a reader you would simply never encounter `throw a, b` in expression position, so it would not come up

[03:16:33.0777] <bakkot>
 * in combination with a `[lookahead ‚â† throw]` restriction in `ExpressionStatement`, to avoid ambiguity

[03:16:59.0066] <rbuckton>
The alternative I had was this:
```
Expression :
  ThrowExpression
  CommaExpression

CommaExpression : // the old Expression production
  AssignmentExpression
  CommaExpression `,` AssignmentExpression
```
And you could potentially even drop _ThrowStatement_ since it would be fully covered by _ExpressionStatement_ (rather than a lookahead restriction in _ExpressionStatement_.

[03:17:29.0847] <bakkot>

[03:18:06.0412] <bakkot>

[03:19:56.0202] <rbuckton>
With the grammar I mention above, rather than the ambiguity of `throw` in an initializer, you would be forced to write it as `function f(x = (throw new Error(...)), y)` which helps with the ambiguity, with the downside that 99% of the places you'd want to use `throw` requiring parens.

[03:20:36.0546] <rbuckton>
I like your approach though, since I'd venture to guess that the number of `throw` statements that use `,` is vanishingly small.

[03:21:18.0623] <bakkot>
pretty small, though probably not vanishingly

[03:21:47.0598] <bakkot>
in particular, stuff like

```
let obj = {
  x: condition ? val : throw new Error('condition is not satisfied'),
  y,
};
```

[03:21:59.0399] <bakkot>
so it's still a little annoying

[03:22:06.0819] <bakkot>
but, no ambiguity.

[03:22:13.0604] <bakkot>
and you fix it with parens and go on with your life

[03:22:19.0283] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> pretty small, though probably not vanishingly

Yeah, minifiers probably do that with `throw` statements today.

[03:22:40.0320] <bakkot>
oh, sorry, yes, lots of `throw` statements with `,` because of minifiers

[03:22:52.0184] <rbuckton>
I'm happy with that though. If you *really* wanted to use `,` in your `throw` expression, you could parenthesize.

[03:22:53.0664] <bakkot>
minifiers love commas

[03:23:11.0642] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> oh, sorry, yes, lots of `throw` statements with `,` because of minifiers

But probably very few hand-written statements, I would venture to guess.

[03:23:20.0309] <bakkot>
agreed

[03:23:54.0268] <bakkot>
reading the old thread, I have a comment which reads

I don't know why it didn't occur to me that you could trivially forbid it with a lookahead...

[03:24:04.0833] <rbuckton>
I am happy with ``ThrowExpression : `throw`  AssignmentExpression [lookahead != `,`] ``

[03:42:43.0273] <rbuckton>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> or me. its only been what, 5 years?

Do we care about other restrictions aside from `,`? any infix operator has the same kind of precedence issue, i.e., `throw a = b` as a statement vs. as an expression. Right now assignment isn't much of an issue in the proposal because the proposal does not allow _ThrowExpression_ to be a valid assignment target, but other operators like `&&`, `||`, `??`, etc. would have a different precedence. That said, you kind of do want to be able to do `a && throw b || c`, but `throw b || c;` has a different meaning.

That said, you kind of may want to be able to write `a && throw b || c`, but `throw b || c;` has a different meaning.

[03:45:19.0226] <rbuckton>
Forcing parentheses (i.e., `(throw err)`) does solve all of those precedence concerns, though.

[03:47:33.0481] <bakkot>
does it have the same issue? wouldn't `a && throw b || c` parse as `a && (throw b || c)`, like `a && yield b || c` does?

[03:48:41.0769] <rbuckton>
`throw` is currently specified as a _UnaryExpression_, so it doesn't have the same precedence as `yield`. `a && yield b || c` isn't legal.

[03:49:07.0436] <rbuckton>
_YieldExpression_ is _AssignmentExpression_, so it can't be on the RHS of `&&`.

[03:49:28.0826] <bakkot>
ah, right

[03:49:32.0033] <bakkot>
I forget `yield` is weird

[03:50:34.0091] <rbuckton>
And one of the motivators for `throw` was to use it with `??`, i.e. `const a = b ?? throw new Error()`, so it wouldn't work as `yield` precedence without parens.

[03:52:13.0188] <rbuckton>
But that's also an alternative to my `CommaExpression` idea. Instead, just make _ThrowExpression_ an _AssignmentExpression_ with the same trailing ``[lookahead != `,`]`` restriction. That would mean you could write `a, throw b`, but not `throw a, b`, which is a bit weird, tbh.

[03:53:07.0958] <bakkot>
I am not super worried about humans writing comma expressions

[03:53:28.0901] <bakkot>
they almost exclusively come up when reading minified code, in my experience

[03:53:50.0591] <bakkot>
occasionally in loop heads but I don't anticipate much use of `throw` there either

[03:54:33.0487] <bakkot>
so while I agree that it would be weird that you could write `a, throw b` but not `throw a, b`, my actual concern is preventing you from writing the second thing, and since I don't think anyone would write the first thing the inconsistency doesn't bother me

[03:58:34.0003] <rbuckton>
Do you have a position on the precedence for other infix operators differing between the statement and expression forms, or was `,` your only concern?

[04:00:19.0067] <bakkot>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> Do we care about other restrictions aside from `,`? any infix operator has the same kind of precedence issue, i.e., `throw a = b` as a statement vs. as an expression.

That said, you kind of may want to be able to write `a && throw b || c`, but `throw b || c;` has a different meaning.

`a && throw b || c` does worry me. I'll have to think more about the tradeoff between that ambiguity and forcing more parens.

[04:01:05.0769] <bakkot>
it is a little less worrying that the `,` case because `throw b || c` isn't really a thing which comes up today, even in minified code, so I am less worried about people misreading it

[04:01:14.0411] <rbuckton>
Would you agree that forcing parens is a working solution, even if only as a fallback?

[04:01:30.0753] <bakkot>
yes, forcing parens solves the ambiguity

[04:01:35.0385] <rbuckton>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> it is a little less worrying that the `,` case because `throw b || c` isn't really a thing which comes up today, even in minified code, so I am less worried about people misreading it

But minifiers, though..

[04:01:50.0183] <bakkot>
even minifiers don't output `throw b || c` in my experience

[04:02:12.0013] <littledan>
when you hear "dataflow", think "reactivity"

[04:02:36.0942] <rbuckton>
I expect that they do emit `throw a && b` though, since they often use `&&` as a substitute for `if` 

[04:02:42.0910] <Michael Ficarra>
littledan: FRP?

[04:04:36.0763] <bakkot>
> <@rbuckton:matrix.org> I expect that they do emit `throw a && b` though, since they often use `&&` as a substitute for `if`

not that I can recall seeing. that's equivalent to `if (!a) throw a; throw b;`, but I think that pattern is rare enough to not have been special-cased

[04:04:58.0451] <bakkot>
`&&` as a substitute for `if` is mainly useful when the rhs of the `if` is an expression

[04:06:41.0711] <bakkot>
looks like `esbuild` does in fact implement that, so it's just that I haven't run into it because it's rare enough

[04:09:44.0820] <bakkot>
another option, which I am... only kind of serious about, would be

```
`throw` AssignmentExpression [lookahead ‚àà {`)`, `}`, `;`, EOF} ]
```

[04:09:58.0893] <bakkot>
this would be fine if everyone used semis consistently

[04:10:29.0252] <rbuckton>
Why would you disallow `)`?

[04:10:38.0273] <bakkot>
that's an allowlist, not a denylist

[04:10:40.0068] <Michael Ficarra>

ish. true for most parsers, but the spec says "parse it. if parse fails, see if it parses after inserting `;`)"

[04:12:05.0468] <bakkot>
in this case it would be though

[04:12:06.0505] <rbuckton>
the grammar has to see source pre-ASI for ASI to work.

[04:12:20.0457] <Michael Ficarra>

`EOF` isn't defined in the spec though.

"end of input" is mentioned only once in terms of White Space. We also have something like "parsed...with no tokens left over" for cover grammars

[04:17:07.0791] <rbuckton>
and "with no tokens left over" is mentioned in The Syntactic Grammar as well when discussing the Script and Module goals.

[04:18:07.0297] <rbuckton>
"end of the input stream" is mentioned in the rules for ASI

[04:18:25.0488] <bakkot>
the EOF isn't necessary because of the ASI thing

[04:18:34.0948] <bakkot>
strike it from my suggestion

[04:18:53.0541] <rbuckton>
Also, `]` should be allowed as well.

[04:18:56.0415] <bakkot>
if you had `a ?? throw b` at the end of the program, ASI would add a `;` so it would parse

[04:19:03.0750] <bakkot>
yup, agreed on `]`

[04:19:20.0757] <rbuckton>
And maybe `{` for something like `class extends a || throw b {`?

[04:19:22.0539] <bakkot>
also should add `:`

[04:19:28.0600] <rbuckton>
for `case`?

[04:19:34.0146] <bakkot>
for `a ? throw b : c`

[04:19:49.0170] <bakkot>
might be easier to enumerate operators which should be disallowed instead, really

[04:20:05.0893] <rbuckton>
Ah, yes. but also `case`. There are a lot of tokens to consider and its possible that list would need to change if/when new syntax is added.

[04:20:11.0350] <bakkot>
yeah

[04:22:01.0107] <rbuckton>
Yeah, I think its easier to restrict to all of the infix operators, or maybe pull out part of _OtherPunctuators_ in the lexical grammar.

[04:32:12.0766] <rbuckton>
It helped to write the `using` implementation in engine262 when writing tests as a way to verify both the implementation and the test itself.

[04:32:50.0519] <Bradford Smith>
Does the current process call for reviewers specifically to review the test262 tests? And if so, are there published guidelines for how to review them?

[04:33:04.0920] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
no, reviewers review the spec

[04:33:19.0402] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>
test262 tests are reviewed by test262 maintainers

[04:35:02.0265] <ptomato (at TC39, limited availability)>
stage 3 reviewers are hereby enthusiastically invited to review the tests, though!

[04:35:16.0016] <ptomato (at TC39, limited availability)>
it really helps the maintainers if the real experts on a proposal weigh in

[04:35:29.0656] <rbuckton>
Though I'd contributed to test262 in the past, I found it very difficult to get started on the tests for `using` as I found the documentation was somewhat lacking in terms of how to set up the environment, and I had trouble running the tests on Windows and had to use WSL. 

[04:36:16.0501] <ptomato (at TC39, limited availability)>
would you like to bring that up in #test262-maintainers:matrix.org and maybe contribute better documentation for that use case?

[04:36:51.0089] <rbuckton>
Plus there is a lot of hunting around to figure out what files you need to add to `includes: []` for some assertions. The experience of working with test262 in an editor like VSCode wasn't great. 

[04:37:34.0171] <rbuckton>
> <@pchimento:igalia.com> would you like to bring that up in #test262-maintainers:matrix.org and maybe contribute better documentation for that use case?

I can bring it up, but it would be hard to document myself if I don't actually have a strong grasp of what needs to be documented.

[04:37:45.0425] <ptomato (at TC39, limited availability)>
this is valuable feedback and I'd love to have a follow up on it

[04:39:02.0599] <rbuckton>
I forwarded the messages to the maintainers chat

[04:39:49.0994] <rbuckton>
What msaboff is saying is exactly why I wrote an implementation for engine262 to verify the tests themselves were accurate.

[04:40:28.0356] <bakkot>
I know michael used polyfills to exercise the iterator helpers tests

[04:46:40.0264] <littledan>
I think it's kinda inconsequential whether the reviews happen before or after tests are written, and it'd be fine to shift this later. I'd be uneasy about potentially weakening "Stage 3" which is why I like the numbering Michael used.

[04:48:46.0314] <Willian Martins>
Maybe stage 3 üî¥ and 3 üü¢?

3.-0 and 3.+0

[04:56:03.0757] <shu>
littledan: i don't think it is actually, it should happen before tests are written

[04:56:43.0622] <shu>

Adding a stage before stage 3 makes stage 3 stronger, but not doing so doesn't make it weaker

[05:02:06.0016] <bakkot>
in my ideal world, implementations would start at stage 2.75, and would write tests, and then champions would do the work of getting those tests into test262 proper, and then get stage 3

I never used coercion for params and I would not let someone pass in a review, if there were to use it...

[06:09:20.0338] <Christian Ulbrich>
TypeScript types for WebAPIs are usually stricter, than the APIs is, i.e. they won't allow using types, that are actually "supported" by coercion.

[06:21:06.0388] <Christian Ulbrich>
Hm. I kind have to retract my argument, having looked at my own code and blaming TypeScript, indeed I am using sth. like `parseFloat(value) < 5` and I do rely on `parseFloat(undefined)` returning `NaN` ... and `NaN < 5` being `false`...

[06:21:38.0694] <ljharb>
having parseFloat return NaN for a non-string input seems ok to me too tho

[06:22:12.0114] <Christian Ulbrich>
I think it returns `NaN` because `undefined` is _coerced_ into `'undefined'`:)

[06:23:04.0028] <ljharb>
right - but i think it would be reasonable to return `NaN` because it's not a string, as well, instead of throwing

[06:23:57.0726] <Christian Ulbrich>
this is somewhat related to stuff, that TS does not like comparing with `undefined`, which to me totally makes sense... and seemingly [not only me](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/45543)

[06:43:06.0362] <Christian Ulbrich>

It certainly does not accept `undefined`, because this gets coerced to `'undefined'` and sets the value to `'undefined'`...

but you're opening yourself up to like, an order of magnitude more hours of bikeshedding

[06:54:25.0845] <Chris de Almeida>
if we're bikeshedding the stage name, 2 splitting into to 2.a, 2.b seems better to me than 2, 2.75

I've been mostly posting this on TDZ, but I seriously think we should go with stages 1, 2, e, œÄ, 4.

[06:55:45.0103] <bakkot>
the reason to signal "almost stage 3" is because we want to explicitly signal "do not keep arguing about design"

[06:55:55.0189] <eemeli>
Then we'd have two three-ish stages.

[06:56:00.0580] <ryzokuken üá≥üá¥>

> <@bakkot:matrix.org> sffc said he'd want more time to review implications for intl

I'm a bit concerned about integral numbers because it is more likely to cause data-driven exceptions. Actually the realm of data-driven exceptions is something we should discuss in plenary.

[07:01:39.0009] <bakkot>
data-driven exceptions seem better than data-driven not-the-right-answer

[07:02:41.0288] <sffc>
There's a big difference between "not the right answer" and "best effort answer". In Intl and i18n we're very much driven by doing a best effort acknowledging that we can never be always exactly "right".

[07:04:19.0967] <bakkot>
I think for APIs which accept integers, passing a non-integral value is generally a programmer error, rather than being a case where there is only a best-effort answer

[07:05:05.0775] <bakkot>
and I generally think programmer errors should be program exceptions, rather than trying to get a best-effort result

[07:05:08.0713] <Michael Ficarra>
RE the "spiraling", the thing we need to keep in mind is that it's fine if we have *an* implementation during stage 2.75 (Dan suggested polyfills/transpilers, but it can also be an engine), it's just the idea is to avoid recommending for general implementation, which is where that aggregate work is extremely high

[07:05:10.0286] <ljharb>
a best-effort answer doesn't necessarily mean you can't restrict inputs

[07:05:19.0819] <ljharb>
it just means the output doesn't have to be perfect

> <@christianulbrich:matrix.org> rbuckton: I only skimmed through my code, at first glance I only found `HTMLInputElement['value']`, this is typed as `string`, where in reality‚Ñ¢ it also accepts `null` to reset the value...

It appears that, while we handle `[LegacyNullToEmptyString]` on method parameters, we don't seem to handle it for properties.

> <@sffc:mozilla.org> There's a big difference between "not the right answer" and "best effort answer". In Intl and i18n we're very much driven by doing a best effort acknowledging that we can never be always exactly "right".

if "correctness" is generally not a design principle in Intl and that domain, and it's instead "approximation", then i can see where you're coming from

[07:10:47.0831] <shu>
for 262 at least "approximation" is most definitely not the design principles for new APIs

[07:15:06.0914] <bakkot>
shu: I do think that, given that the committee is receptive to breaking with precedent for coercing stuff in at least some cases, it is maybe worth asking to break with precedent for any new TA things

[07:15:17.0521] <bakkot>
to avoid the awful user code coercions

[07:15:30.0778] <shu>
yeah, the TA problem is narrowly solvable

[07:15:44.0170] <shu>
it'd be _nice_ to solve it generally but i'll take any improvement obv

[07:16:01.0239] <bakkot>
on the "coercing objects to strings is useful" point, one of the things I will ask about next time I bring this up is, just don't coerce objects _to number_, and continue coercing to string

[07:16:24.0316] <bakkot>
since, granted, there is some utility to coercing things like URL to string

[07:16:40.0081] <bakkot>
(even if I personally would prefer people do it explicitly)

[07:16:58.0563] <shu>
i'd also take "built-in toString methods only" but that's not that nice and hurts polyfills

[07:17:44.0520] <Christian Ulbrich>
rbuckton: Quite the service! Thanks for creating the bug. From my mind, there were other issues, I'll report them once I have some more time, currently only ~30 `//@ts-ignore` in our code base, not too bad. The other thing, was with `NodeListOf` being _iteratable_ (sic!)  but I have to give this a more thorough look on _modern_ TypeScript (we are currently at `4.6.2`. 

[07:18:47.0824] <shu>
actually let's generalize that, it'd be cool to have the dynamic extent of argument + receiver coercion to throw on user code, even if they continue to coerce

[07:21:10.0927] <sffc>
> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> for 262 at least "approximation" is most definitely not the design principles for new APIs

I think this is an appropriate line to draw

[07:23:10.0281] <bakkot>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> a best-effort answer doesn't necessarily mean you can't restrict inputs

as a concrete example: "give me the best 2 candidate locales" is a well-posed question with only an approximately correct answer. "give me the best 2.5 candidate locales" is an ill-posed question, just as much as "give me the best NaN candidate locales" is. throwing is the right response to ill-posed questions.

[07:25:03.0712] <sffc>
I'm happy to iterate on the language surrounding when ToIntegerIfIntegral should be used versus truncation

[07:56:50.0744] <Richard Gibson>
I'm having difficulty in coming up with any scenario where we would prefer truncation other than for consistency with existing APIs. It's just such a mess that e.g. `-0.2` is accepted as a non-negative integer or `max + 0.1` is rejected where `max - 1 + 0.1` is accepted as equivalent to `max - 1`.

[08:07:34.0324] <sffc>
> <@gibson042:matrix.org> I'm having difficulty in coming up with any scenario where we would prefer truncation other than for consistency with existing APIs. It's just such a mess that e.g. `-0.2` is accepted as a non-negative integer or `max + 0.1` is rejected where `max - 1 + 0.1` is accepted as equivalent to `max - 1`.

So you have every right to disagree with this example, but something like truncating "123.4 minutes" to "123 minutes" in Intl.DurationFormat is not necessarily bad, especially if (and again, people are welcome to disagree) we have a path toward making the fractional digits work in the future.

[08:34:55.0752] <Richard Gibson>
I definitely do disagree; that's a clear case where the truncation is **bad** because "123.4 minutes" has a valid interpretation that is silently discarded in favor of equivalence with "123 minutes", making future support for respecting the fractional part more difficult. This is an analogue of the motivating use case in Temporal Durations, which couldn't lean on the fuzziness inherent to ECMA-402 formatting (that _might_ leave a sufficient gap for future extension, but then again might not) as justification.

 * I definitely do disagree; that's a clear case where the truncation would be bad because "123.4 minutes" has a valid interpretation that should not be silently discarded in favor of equivalence with "123 minutes", making future support for respecting the fractional part more difficult. This is an analogue of the motivating use case in Temporal Durations, which couldn't lean on the fuzziness inherent to ECMA-402 formatting (that _might_ leave a sufficient gap for future extension, but then again might not) as justification.

The counter-point is that if we were to enable that type of extension in the future, it's not inherently bad that older engines operate with the approximate behavior. Many programmers will not think about catching the exception in older engines, causing those browsers to needlessly break when they would otherwise get close-but-not-quite-right output.

[08:54:18.0374] <sffc>
As an example, we executed on this successfully when we deployed the "interpret strings as decimals" change in Intl.NumberFormat.prototype.format.

[09:51:53.0649] <TabAtkins>
I'm with sffc here that this is a very debatable case that has a reasonable argument for truncation. (But I'm generally for the "stop coercing/truncating everywhere" proposal.)

> <@bakkot:matrix.org> just that I think the community would be better served by us focusing on stdlib stuff over syntax, at the margin

I don't think we need to set these against each other, but I do agree we need *way* more stdlib investment in this group. (And I need to finish my own contribution to that, the seeded-random proposal.)

[10:11:42.0020] <TabAtkins>
The justification of "make everything method-chainable" is still valid. It would be good to do another review of everything trying to do similar things. But I don't think protocols clash in any meaningful way.

[10:12:35.0319] <TabAtkins>
Like if you *squint* they're both doing similar things (playing in the method space, without messing with prototypes) but protocols use-case, justifications, and abilities are quite distinct.

A question about `import defer`. Currently, a module include top level-await will not be deferred. Could we allow implementations do some static analysis and optimization to defer the sync part (code after the last `await` expression) ?

[03:45:15.0747] <Ashley Claymore>
Wouldn't that break run until completion semantics?

[03:45:48.0760] <Ashley Claymore>
Maybe not if it, as you say,  doesn't start to run 

[03:46:30.0487] <Ashley Claymore>
I'm not sure how big a saving g that would add, just the last part of one module

[03:49:57.0507] <Ashley Claymore>
Interesting idea though, I'd love to try it out on our version of `import defer` at Bloomberg but our equivalent of TLA isn't as statically analysable so not really possible 

[04:11:07.0057] <Ashley Claymore>
* I'm not sure how big a saving that would add, just the last part of the N preloaded async modules 

[08:00:43.0789] <rbuckton>
The tricky part of "defer the sync part" is that TLA can be conditional, with the final `await` sitting behind a branch that might not be evaluated. You cannot know whether it will be until the condition is evaluated. Which part, then, is the sync part?

Great meeting and dinner!

cool to see engine262 getting more mind share. i guess that project for evaluating the spec text didn't catch on?

[00:15:22.0153] <Ashley Claymore>
esmeta? It's run as part of the 262 spec CI https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/main/.github/workflows/esmeta-typecheck.yml

[00:16:21.0124] <Ashley Claymore>
also ‚ù§Ô∏è engine262

[01:04:27.0412] <bakkot>
strictly speaking we only run the typechecker part of esmeta, not the actual evaluator

[04:23:47.0701] <littledan>
Same goes for call syntax, I think(which I previously made the same overlap comment about)

[09:33:00.0537] <Mathieu Hofman>
I have been meaning to fix this for a while. I actually started rewriting the asyncGC helper and the tests, but I really don't have much time to dedicate to this.

[09:34:07.0656] <Mathieu Hofman>
If someone is interested in taking over I can try to cleanup my old local experiment. Some tests do need to be rewritten to accommodate
