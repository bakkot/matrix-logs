[The September Tokyo plenary invite](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/499) is now posted on the Reflector.

If anyone needs support on visas (e.g. generating an invite letter from the host), please let me know.  It is just under 12 weeks away.

Note that we are working on a community event the evening before, on the 25th.

‚òùÔ∏è this is a low-stakes change, but would be nice to get some more blessings on it

Do we already have a matrix room for the in-person participants to the meeting?

[05:09:04.0578] <Jack Works>
I don't think so

[05:15:50.0048] <Rob Palmer>
Please create one, Nicolo! 

[10:43:59.0133] <Michael Ficarra>
nicolo-ribaudo: can you link the room here or send me an invite?

[10:55:31.0958] <nicolo-ribaudo>
You already joined it some hours ago üòÖ

[11:09:18.0673] <Michael Ficarra>

Sorry if this is a basic element/matrix question, but how do I join the TC39 space, like the thing that organizes all of the TC39 rooms into one view?

[03:51:45.0811] <nicolo-ribaudo>
https://matrix.to/#/#tc39-space:matrix.org try this

[03:51:55.0289] <nicolo-ribaudo>
https://matrix.to/#/#tc39-space:matrix.org

[04:30:05.0188] <dminor>
Well, it looks like that should work, but my element client just spins on `loading` for 30 minutes :/ I'll try again later.

[05:51:59.0214] <Rob Palmer>
Is anyone available to dial into zoom to help confirm AV in 20 mins time? 

[06:00:12.0717] <Ashley Claymore>
I'll try the zoom from the hotel Wi-fi

[06:08:35.0032] <Rob Palmer>
Thanks, Ashley

[06:10:14.0035] <Ashley Claymore>
ping me a link when you're ready

[06:54:05.0941] <dminor>
Works now, thanks for the help :)
