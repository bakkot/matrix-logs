[The September Tokyo plenary invite](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/499) is now posted on the Reflector.

If anyone needs support on visas (e.g. generating an invite letter from the host), please let me know.  It is just under 12 weeks away.

Note that we are working on a community event the evening before, on the 25th.
