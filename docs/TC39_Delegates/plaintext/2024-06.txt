What's the right process to get consensus on it from TG1 in Helsinki for normative PRs to ECMA-402? Do I add it as a standalone agenda item?  As part of a standing agenda item for 402 changes?  Something else? PR is https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/877

This is mostly a "web reality" change that aligns the spec with how V8 and JSC already behave by tightening under-specified parts of the spec. It also adds forward-looking guidance to handle future issues that may crop up with time zone identifiers.

Ideally I would have asked this question yesterday before the deadline, but I mistakenly believed that all TG2-approved PRs would magically make it into the agenda. Oops. Anyway, I'll add this as a late submission.

I believe you still have two hours before the deadline

this is a three-day meeting so the deadline is Saturday rather than Friday (but Saturday in Helsinki, so earlier than it would for meetings in PT)

Yeah, it should be added under "Needs Consensus PRs". ECMA-402 PRs previously got added automatically, but that practice stopped about a year ago. Now we just make an announcement in the monthly TG2 call to remind champions to add their stuff to the TG1 agenda if it needs TG1 consensus.
