What's the right process to get consensus on it from TG1 in Helsinki for normative PRs to ECMA-402? Do I add it as a standalone agenda item?  As part of a standing agenda item for 402 changes?  Something else? PR is https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/pull/877

This is mostly a "web reality" change that aligns the spec with how V8 and JSC already behave by tightening under-specified parts of the spec. It also adds forward-looking guidance to handle future issues that may crop up with time zone identifiers.

Ideally I would have asked this question yesterday before the deadline, but I mistakenly believed that all TG2-approved PRs would magically make it into the agenda. Oops. Anyway, I'll add this as a late submission.

I believe you still have two hours before the deadline

this is a three-day meeting so the deadline is Saturday rather than Friday (but Saturday in Helsinki, so earlier than it would for meetings in PT)
