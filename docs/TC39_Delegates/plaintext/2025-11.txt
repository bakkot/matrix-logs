nicolo-ribaudo: re https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1950211, the "Don't call well-known Symbol methods for RegExp on primitive values", I'm having trouble inferring the status from the bug tracker. Did FF ship? Or just ship telemetry? And is there telemetry?

[14:27:40.0138] <bakkot>
Looks like V8 implemented without a flag and will just ship it whenever main makes it up to stable for them

[14:27:52.0235] <bakkot>
same in webkit

[14:28:01.0474] <bakkot>
not sure if this means we should land the PR or wait for FF

[14:34:14.0067] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I don't remember, I'll get an answer in the next days

It looks like we just shipped the telemetry. I think at this point if webkit and v8 are shipping, we should just remove the telemetry and ship the change.
nicolo-ribaudo do you want to make the updates, or would you like me to take it over?

[06:44:47.0645] <bakkot>
I don't know if either of the other browsers are shipping to stable, to be clear

Mh yeah it looks like I ended up not finishing that patch because somebody was refactoring the same code at the same time 😅

I am not able to type for a few weeks, please go ahead :) I'd be curious to see the telemetry data we have so far

[07:12:02.0835] <dminor>
bakkot: do you have links handy for the webkit and v8 changes? It would be helpful for coordinating shipping.

[07:13:36.0272] <bakkot>
Linked from the ecma262 issue iirc, I can dig them up when I'm at a computer next

[07:13:49.0298] <bakkot>
Or the pr rather 

[07:16:42.0512] <dminor>
Got them, thanks!

There's an interesting discussion here on native error objects in Wasm - https://github.com/WebAssembly/custom-descriptors/issues/80.

The driving motivation is Wasm GC objects being used as throwable errors, by being able to somehow relate the Wasm GC error object's descriptor to make it a real error object. This discussion comes under the proposal umbrella of turning "opaque" GC objects into real objects with descriptors.

In particular the `Symbol.underlyingError` could be interesting to get feedback for from a TC39 perspective.

@guybedford:matrix.org There's still time to add discussion items to the agenda for the next TC39 meeting.

[09:10:51.0781] <guybedford>
I'm not personally involved in the above discussion, I'm posting here in the hopes more folks can take these discussions on!
