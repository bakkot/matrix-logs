nicolo-ribaudo: re https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1950211, the "Don't call well-known Symbol methods for RegExp on primitive values", I'm having trouble inferring the status from the bug tracker. Did FF ship? Or just ship telemetry? And is there telemetry?

Looks like V8 implemented without a flag and will just ship it whenever main makes it up to stable for them

[14:27:52.0235] <bakkot>
same in webkit

[14:28:01.0474] <bakkot>
not sure if this means we should land the PR or wait for FF
