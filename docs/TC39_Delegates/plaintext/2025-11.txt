nicolo-ribaudo: re https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1950211, the "Don't call well-known Symbol methods for RegExp on primitive values", I'm having trouble inferring the status from the bug tracker. Did FF ship? Or just ship telemetry? And is there telemetry?

[14:27:40.0138] <bakkot>
Looks like V8 implemented without a flag and will just ship it whenever main makes it up to stable for them

[14:27:52.0235] <bakkot>
same in webkit

[14:28:01.0474] <bakkot>
not sure if this means we should land the PR or wait for FF

[14:34:14.0067] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I don't remember, I'll get an answer in the next days

[15:20:58.0959] <nicolo-ribaudo>

It looks like we just shipped the telemetry. I think at this point if webkit and v8 are shipping, we should just remove the telemetry and ship the change.
nicolo-ribaudo do you want to make the updates, or would you like me to take it over?

[06:44:47.0645] <bakkot>
I don't know if either of the other browsers are shipping to stable, to be clear

Mh yeah it looks like I ended up not finishing that patch because somebody was refactoring the same code at the same time 😅

I am not able to type for a few weeks, please go ahead :) I'd be curious to see the telemetry data we have so far

[07:12:02.0835] <dminor>
bakkot: do you have links handy for the webkit and v8 changes? It would be helpful for coordinating shipping.

[07:13:36.0272] <bakkot>
Linked from the ecma262 issue iirc, I can dig them up when I'm at a computer next

[07:13:49.0298] <bakkot>
Or the pr rather 

[07:16:42.0512] <dminor>
Got them, thanks!

There's an interesting discussion here on native error objects in Wasm - https://github.com/WebAssembly/custom-descriptors/issues/80.

The driving motivation is Wasm GC objects being used as throwable errors, by being able to somehow relate the Wasm GC error object's descriptor to make it a real error object. This discussion comes under the proposal umbrella of turning "opaque" GC objects into real objects with descriptors.

In particular the `Symbol.underlyingError` could be interesting to get feedback for from a TC39 perspective.

[09:10:06.0769] <Michael Ficarra>
@guybedford:matrix.org There's still time to add discussion items to the agenda for the next TC39 meeting.

[09:10:51.0781] <guybedford>
I'm not personally involved in the above discussion, I'm posting here in the hopes more folks can take these discussions on!

[09:15:56.0262] <Michael Ficarra>
my reading of this is that it would only affect debugger behaviour, which 262 does not constrain

[09:16:38.0684] <bakkot>
It is an interesting question how hosts should expose their own well known symbols though

[09:18:03.0749] <Michael Ficarra>
TG4 probably has a lot of the interested parties. This person may want to make a presentation to them. Not sure what TC39 could do about it though.

[10:57:20.0741] <guybedford>
The root problem is basically subclassing Error for Wasm GC objects, which is currently off the table as something in Wasm explicitly.

[10:57:39.0297] <guybedford>
so if non-Error objects might be able to define a symbol or otherwise to get error-level treatment

[11:37:31.0123] <Mathieu Hofman>
Haven't read the thread yet, but why not create an Error at the wasm boundary, with a `cause` being the wasm opaque object ?

[14:27:17.0261] <bakkot>
Wasm GC objects can be passed around to and from JS FFIs. Is the idea that you'd wrap every FFI call which involved a Wasm GC object to inspect the object and determine if you should substitute a wrapper?

[14:27:26.0678] <bakkot>
I think that would work but it's probably prohibitively expensive

[14:27:37.0964] <bakkot>
(possibly I am not understanding the suggestion)


2025-11-05
[18:00:52.0180] <Mathieu Hofman>
are wasm opaque objects exposed directly to JS code? My impression was that there is currently glue code to wrap those. Now of course we could ask the question for when wasm objects are no longer opaque and gain prototypes, and possibly own props. My concern is that I don't want to introduce yet another "kind" of Error that all error aware code out there needs to recognize (not just debuggers). We have Error instances, and I guess we're also getting objects extended with `Error.captureStackTrace`.

[18:03:20.0600] <Mathieu Hofman>
especially now that we have `Error.isError`, I think it'd be a mistake to introduce something that isn't an error but behaves like one. It's already unfortunate enough we have to standardize captureStackTrace

[18:19:01.0275] <guybedford>
Mathieu Hofman: the wasm custom descriptors proposal turns the opaque objects directly into objects with descriptors allowing getters and setters etc.

[18:19:34.0448] <guybedford>
they thus effectively become resource types, backed by a wasm gc managed struct or array

[18:23:15.0327] <guybedford>
I'd have thought the solution though would be to call out to `wrapErr(scalaErr) => Object.assign(new Error(), { gcError: scalaErr })` through to JS when there is an error to have a JS error type wrapping a scala error type instead of the converse, but I haven't thought about it deeply enough to have a strong opinion

[18:32:22.0332] <Mathieu Hofman>
Right, even with custom descriptors support, this is effectively purpose built glue code creating JS objects to expose wasm things. In that case, I would find it natural to create a `new Error()` and define on it a `cause: wasmThrowable` property.


2025-11-10
[11:47:37.0414] <rbuckton>
Would it be possible to get some folks from the runtimes that have implemented Explicit Resource Management to help finish the reviews on the remaining Test262 PRs? I've been trying to get some eyes on these three PRs for a few months, but the Test262 maintainers seem to be spread very thin:
- https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4482
- https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4480
- https://github.com/tc39/test262/pull/4478

nicolo-ribaudo: thanks for putting together slides for the export-\*-as PR. while we're here, I noticed in https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-scripts-and-modules.html#sec-resolveexport step 9.e.iii.1 that it says "Assert: There is more than one \* import that includes the requested name". That should be "\* _export_", surely, yes?

[19:16:06.0464] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Yep you are right

[19:57:03.0310] <arai>
I'm testing on SpiderMonkey.  there's some issue with the expectation around how "asyncTest" should interact with "negative".  not yet sure if it's on our side or in the test side

[19:58:41.0470] <arai>
also there are 3 tests that expects behavior before https://github.com/rbuckton/ecma262/pull/14 , for using in switch

ljharb: I am confused by https://github.com/tc39/agendas/commit/61962210dd2547d194eae2bb9cdf8669421a4f98; when did this get stage 2.7 and where are the tests for it?

[20:04:18.0749] <rbuckton>
Thanks, I'll take a look tomorrow

[20:21:14.0703] <arai>

[20:23:09.0662] <ljharb>

draft schedule is up!  see Reflector issue for link:  https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/564

[17:56:23.0320] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Day 1 afternoon there are a bunch of stage 4 advancements and my low priority topic. I wonder if we could squeeze some time off the advancements (that tend to be very quick), and replace my low priority topic with a different 30 min one?

I'm very happy to present, but I'm feeling a bit like I'm wasting time by presenting it when there are things currently scheduled to overflow 😅

[18:04:26.0957] <Chris de Almeida>
sounds like you are volunteering to move your topic to the bottom of schedule priority.  we can certainly do that 

[18:04:46.0391] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Well it was already marked as low priority in the agenda

[18:04:53.0948] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I mean the one about other module stuff on the web

[18:05:12.0855] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Which is just an informative topic, not something for our specs

[21:48:54.0041] <Christian Ulbrich>

Can we try with the V2 this time? 😅

[22:37:50.0011] <Chris de Almeida>
we just might!  Christian and I are trying to reproduce the bugs we found from using it last time and we can't reproduce...  

[23:49:04.0085] <Rob Palmer>
Brian is also debugging TCQ: Legendary Edition

[23:54:24.0546] <Christian Ulbrich>
Rob Palmer: If you could get him, to give away the stats of his setup (VM cpu cores, ram size), I could reproduce this at least as an approximation. I very very highly assume, that there are various race conditions in his original code (that TCQ reloaded, simply re-uses) - having an environment that is more close to his original, might "solve" the currently reported bugs for TCQ reloaded, which we could not reproduce now.

[02:41:38.0295] <Rob Palmer>

Chris de Almeida: I am on the agenda as the last slot for today; per my schedule constraints I can't be present after 1600 (ideally 1500). could I be moved to a later day?

[15:27:32.0393] <bakkot>
if not it's not an urgent item and can get removed

[15:28:35.0360] <nicolo-ribaudo>
If you want we can swap our slots

[15:29:08.0745] <nicolo-ribaudo>
(the export defer one)

[15:30:10.0253] <bakkot>
I'm hoping a later day works anyway because I am sick today and may not be up to presenting that item today

[18:27:34.0745] <bakkot>
it can be used to add private fields, but those are slightly different

[18:28:36.0356] <bakkot>
all objects are created with an internal slot which stores a list of their private fields; that list is what gets updated when fields are added to an object, rather than the object itself getting a new slot

[18:30:25.0421] <Michael Ficarra>
thank you, I was trying to look through the spec to confirm that claim

[18:34:15.0293] <Michael Ficarra>
I think it's just editorial though and we would just stick the slot on every object in MakeBasicObject

[18:34:47.0525] <Michael Ficarra>

[20:36:36.0831] <eemeli>
Not supporting trailing zeros is the only blocker for a digit string representation of a number to be able to fully represent a numeric value together with a precision. Effectively we're trying to fix a small overlooked formatting bug here.

[20:36:51.0702] <Richard Gibson>
I'd like to give it one more look, but let's set a timeout for the end of this meeting

[20:38:34.0427] <Michael Ficarra>
oh god, who did this?

[20:39:17.0134] <ljharb>
(oh also, belated, for Joint Iteration, https://npmjs.com/es-iterator-helpers also implements it in quasi-spec text and it passes all tests)

[20:39:28.0819] <Chris de Almeida>
no snitching in plenary

[20:40:11.0309] <Michael Ficarra>
you should mention that in the test262 PR

[20:40:41.0445] <ptomato>
yes please do, I find that helpful at least

[20:47:44.0277] <Michael Ficarra>
certainly Guy's concerns would not affect Stage 3, they would be Stage 2.7

[20:48:12.0538] <Michael Ficarra>
I think he's maybe just not familiar with our process

[20:49:16.0091] <Michael Ficarra>
if anything, they sound more like concerns for which we'd consider reverting to Stage 1 to me

[20:56:04.0453] <bakkot>
the proposal is moving way from the thing on the screen

[20:56:10.0925] <rkirsling>
TIL "barrel file"

[20:56:32.0677] <bakkot>
iow I am confused by the observation that barrel files are bad for performance, given that the point of this proposal is, now they would not be bad for performance?

[20:57:12.0555] <bakkot>
if your problem with barrel files is that they have bad performance, making them not have bad performance seems like... it solves the problem?

[20:57:24.0766] <ljharb>
only if they were all created with defers all the way down

[20:57:33.0030] <ljharb>
which i think is a pretty big presumption

[20:58:02.0289] <ljharb>
iow, someone who's that vigilant would in theory be avoiding barrel files in the first place.

[21:02:02.0636] <Justin Ridgewell>
Barrel files are good for DX, bad for perf. Let's fix perf

[21:07:34.0385] <ljharb>
i don't agree they're good for DX

[21:07:56.0041] <snek>
i mean people using them in spite of the performance issues kind of proves the dx, no?

[21:08:54.0744] <eemeli>
Why do we have two @erights Mark Miller (Agoric) MMs on the Zoom call?

[21:09:06.0520] <Christian Ulbrich>
Second that. We can argue all the way about them, being devilish, fact is they are used pretty often.

[21:10:12.0467] <Chris de Almeida>
he likes to join via phone as well

[21:11:25.0374] <Christian Ulbrich>
eemeli: I think that has to do with space time.

[21:13:07.0783] <eemeli>
... and not e.g. with "them, being devilish"?

[21:14:11.0465] <Christian Ulbrich>
devilish referred to barrels and space time to two marks.

[21:20:47.0580] <Michael Ficarra>
agreed with @bakkot:matrix.org, in a vacuum we would treat it as if undefined was passed, not throw

[21:21:12.0552] <Michael Ficarra>
so diverging just to do the not-ideal thing seems not good

[21:21:25.0647] <rkirsling>
I too agree

[21:21:27.0086] <bakkot>
if we are branching on presence anyway I guess I don't really care about throw vs no-op

[21:21:41.0869] <ljharb>
it could also mean they're an attractive nuisance.

[21:22:32.0285] <Mathieu Hofman>

idk what this means

[21:28:14.0586] <ljharb>
it means they're something people _think_ they want but has subtle or unknown consequences they aren't aware of but wouldn't like

[21:28:30.0497] <ljharb>
iow, "choice" shouldn't ever be conflated with "informed choice"

[21:28:36.0628] <Michael Ficarra>
wait wtf there's slides now?

[21:29:15.0797] <bakkot>
not on the agenda there's not

[21:29:58.0939] <rbuckton>
```js
{
  let bar = foo.bar;
  if (bar) { ... }
}
```

[21:30:21.0803] <snek>
but those consequences are not to the developer, they're to the user. 

[21:30:31.0889] <Michael Ficarra>
yes I literally do that because I hate having my bindings visible outside where they should be used

[21:30:32.0063] <Justin Ridgewell>
I wonder if V8 implemented during-function GC…

[21:30:37.0547] <rbuckton>
* ```js
{

{
  let bar = foo2.bar;

It seems Decl in cond proposal doesn't change anything compare to the version 5 years ago?

[21:30:59.0017] <snek>
depends on the function

[21:30:59.0377] <ljharb>
which is *worse* because in the priority of constituencies, users rank higher :-) also because the dev is even less aware of the harm they cause

[21:31:20.0611] <snek>
sure, i'm just clarifying that its still good DX, even if the UX is bad

[21:31:50.0602] <snek>
(and ideally, DX and UX should be aligned, but obviously that is not always the case)

[21:33:18.0359] <ljharb>
fair clarification

[21:33:33.0861] <ljharb>
i'd stretch to say that good DX that leads to bad UX is itself bad DX, because it begets angry users later

[21:35:33.0383] <Justin Ridgewell>
But we can make good DX also good UX

[21:35:54.0920] <snek>
i am absolutely shocked that anyone would want them to bind in other branches

[21:37:02.0650] <bakkot>
snek: I think this presentation didn't really cover all the contours. it's relevant that the proposal also includes an expression form:

```
if (let x = foo; condition(x)) {

} else {

}
```

[21:37:15.0908] <bakkot>
there's a lot more reason for `x` to be visible in the `else` here

[21:37:19.0328] <bakkot>
that said I still think it should not

[21:37:19.0484] <Justin Ridgewell>
I have certainly wanted to access the binding in the `catch { }` block

[21:37:27.0276] <snek>
no that should just be declared above if statement

[21:37:29.0605] <ptomato>
I think Devin's `a && b` example is a convincing example why someone might want that

[21:37:31.0382] <bakkot>
also the fact that this is included is not at all obvious from the state of the proposal repo

[21:37:32.0525] <snek>
* no that should just be declared above the if statement

[21:37:37.0656] <bakkot>
what if it's a `using`

[21:37:50.0556] <bakkot>
in fact the specific ability to put `using` here is the main reason I want this proposal at all

[21:38:00.0097] <rkirsling>
yeah I didn't realize the `;` addition was coming

[21:38:01.0857] <snek>
then wrap it in a block

[21:38:07.0101] <snek>
that seems way simpler to understand 

[21:38:10.0774] <bakkot>
do the wrapping

[21:38:13.0076] <bakkot>
it's not trivial at all

[21:38:16.0985] <bakkot>
you want disposal before the `else`

[21:38:31.0177] <Justin Ridgewell>
`let foo = maybeThrows(); try { … } catch { }` is a non-starter.

[21:38:32.0404] <snek>
no i mean if you want to use it in both branches

[21:38:34.0831] <snek>
it should be above the else

[21:38:39.0811] <bakkot>
oh!

[21:38:40.0415] <bakkot>
yeah

[21:38:41.0206] <bakkot>
agreed

[21:38:42.0765] <bakkot>
strongly

[21:38:51.0672] <snek>
cool

[21:38:52.0282] <Justin Ridgewell>
I want `try (let foo = maybeThrows()) { … } catch { }`

[21:39:07.0927] <rkirsling>
I'm fine with or without the `;` but I feel strongly about the non-exposure to `else`

[21:39:27.0285] <Justin Ridgewell>
Doing `let foo; try { foo = maybeThrows(); … } catch { }` feels ikcy

[21:39:30.0489] <Justin Ridgewell>
* Doing `let foo; try { foo = maybeThrows(); … } catch { }` feels icky

[21:39:58.0054] <Justin Ridgewell>

[21:41:12.0907] <nicolo-ribaudo>
The spec is only missing entering/exiting a new block scope right?

[21:41:20.0918] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Because right now the variables leak outside of the if/loop

[21:41:27.0601] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Even if they are defined in the head

[21:42:14.0643] <bakkot>
well, and like

[21:42:16.0714] <bakkot>
semantics for the if

[21:42:31.0537] <bakkot>
* semantics for the `if`

[21:42:33.0477] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Oh right the semicolon version

[21:42:42.0114] <bakkot>
either version

[21:42:51.0911] <bakkot>
declaration have empty completion values

[21:42:57.0356] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
I agree with bakkot , for `if (decl; cond)` there are too many use cases require decl is availabe. But if no cond, there is no use case. This is the bad smell for the design.

[21:43:01.0115] <waldemar>
None of the new forms have semantics in the spec

[21:43:10.0146] <danielrosenwasser>
```
if (let { data, error } = ...; data) {
  // use data 
}
else {
  // use error
}
```

[21:43:35.0061] <bakkot>
danielrosenwasser: just put the declaration above the `if` in that case

[21:43:37.0146] <rkirsling>
wait what, analogous to `for`?

[21:43:44.0685] <snek>
this seems like a better motivation for the pattern matching proposal

[21:43:48.0492] <danielrosenwasser>
I was *very* surprised about `else` scope, but have written a good amount of code that uses it

[21:43:49.0287] <snek>
than trying to shove that into this

[21:43:49.0477] <rkirsling>
that's actually more of a head-scratching statement to me

[21:44:04.0416] <danielrosenwasser>
* I was _very_ surprised about `else` scope, but have written a good amount of code that uses it. It's nice.

[21:44:08.0247] <bakkot>
a `for` is an initialization which runs first, then a test, which runs second. this is the same pretty much! except the init has to be a declaration, but whatever

[21:44:22.0813] <danielrosenwasser>
The point is to avoid 2-3 `data` and `error`s :D

[21:44:45.0114] <bakkot>
... I don't understand? the obvious rewrite where you put it above doesn't have any more

[21:45:02.0464] <bakkot>
```
let { data, error } = ...;
if (data) {
  // use data 
}
else {
  // use error
}
```

[21:45:17.0402] <bakkot>
or if you really care about scope,

```
{
let { data, error } = ...;
if (data) {
  // use data 
}
else {
  // use error
}
}
```

[21:45:19.0878] <Mathieu Hofman>
are we talking about only have a single `;` permissible. Because if you have multiple `;` it gets confusing again compared to `for` 

[21:45:21.0014] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
And I also think if we introduce such syntax, we should not copy c++, but swift/rust instead.

[21:45:29.0418] <danielrosenwasser>
I don't understand why the two have to be at odds?

[21:46:00.0513] <danielrosenwasser>
* I don't understand why the two (pattern matching and variable-scoped `if`) have to be at odds with each other

[21:46:18.0507] <bakkot>
yes, zero or one

[21:46:33.0629] <snek>
i'm fine with conditional declarations and pattern matching both existing 

[21:46:49.0608] <snek>
just no conditional declarations being visible in alternatives. i am strongly against that.

[21:46:51.0413] <rkirsling>
I don't think it's fair to block this on a controversial sub-proposal of a Stage 1 proposal; even within the pattern matching space, I have _very_ mixed feelings about `is`

[21:47:01.0435] <rkirsling>
this proposal is way more basic than pattern matching

[21:47:29.0902] <hax (HE Shi-Jun)>
I don't like the proposal in current form, but I will offline soon. If it was asked to enter stage 2, i will vote for no. I think we should wait for pattern match proposal.

[21:48:21.0003] <snek>
switch head visible to bodies is fine, that block encloses the cases

[21:48:23.0687] <bakkot>
 I used to not really have an opinion on visibility, but with the inclusion of `using` I now feel strongly that the `using` binding must be disposed before the `else`, which implies the binding should not be visible in the `else`. rust actually changed their behavior to make disposal happen before the `else`! https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Declarations-in-Conditionals/issues/3#issuecomment-3458395454

[21:48:39.0207] <Michael Ficarra>
+1 Ron, I want to see the significant cross-cutting concerns fully explored before this proposal moves to Stage 2

[21:48:40.0250] <bakkot>
rust does not like to change things but this repeatedly caused nasty bugs in production

[21:49:52.0998] <rkirsling>
wasn't expecting a `switch` discussion 🤔 feel like ljharb would have some strong opinions

[21:50:24.0355] <rkirsling>

I think the curly braces is a good argument, can't come up with an example, because I do not do my if-clauses w/o curlies. Hold on!

[21:53:58.0975] <Mathieu Hofman>

[21:55:21.0502] <ljharb>
i'll only grumble quietly as long as a consistent linter-enforced decision is made, but omitting braces - that's how you get [gotofail](https://www.blackduck.com/blog/understanding-apple-goto-fail-vulnerability-2.html)

[21:55:36.0463] <Michael Ficarra>
no? there's just a lot of stuff on the queue

[21:56:22.0600] <snek>
oh i see, olivier started with the other topic

[21:56:30.0882] <snek>
i got confused and thought daniel was talking

[21:58:12.0936] <Christian Ulbrich>
For me it is about visual pattern recognition, whenever I see an if without curlies, I have to adjust and I do not want to that. I prefer solutions, that always work™.

definitely dislike optional blocks, except for arrow functions

[22:00:49.0465] <ljharb>
sure, but that's an aesthetic preference that presumably is more important to you than the lexical availability of bindings?

That makes sense. Thanks for the example

Re tdz: I think we should be careful with new TDZ after V8's feedback a whole ago 

[22:02:37.0317] <Olivier Flückiger>
Ok, I did not think about the `if (...; cond)` syntax. In my mind the binding was just `false` in the `else` case. So with that I see the appeal of not having it in else....

[22:03:30.0535] <Olivier Flückiger>
but yeah, I am still worried about more TDZ

[22:03:35.0270] <Steve Hicks>
I'm confused, the `if (...; cond)` is exactly why it's useful to have the binding in the else - as in the better diagnostics example of _why_ did the condition fail?

[22:04:34.0287] <Jake Archibald>
Steve Hicks: maybe `if (const response = await response; response?.ok)`?

[22:04:45.0750] <Jake Archibald>
* Steve Hicks: maybe `if (const response = await fetch(…); response?.ok)`?

[22:05:32.0312] <snek>
i think this motivates pattern matching, not having the binding available outside the consequent 

[22:06:03.0378] <Jake Archibald>
* Steve Hicks: <del>maybe `if (const response = await fetch(…); response?.ok)`?</del> ignore me, I'm tired

[22:06:34.0885] <danielrosenwasser>
Pattern matching is cool, but other languages have this feature with no pattern matching as well. There are plenty of times you want to bind a variable and check some specific condition that has nothing to do with truthiness

[22:06:36.0484] <bakkot>
better diagnostics argues for, but `using` argues against, and I think is much stronger (since for diagnostics you can of course just put the binding outside). I want to be able to write this, and have the resource be disposed before the `else`. I invite you to rewrite it assuming that the binding lives through the `else`. I can't make it pretty!

```
if (using resource = getResource(); resource.needsUpdate) {
  resource.update();
} else {
  await postMessage('no updates required');
}
```

[22:06:36.0951] <Michael Ficarra>
I really hope the champion understands the breadth of work required to actually prepare this proposal for Stage 2. It's a lot.

[22:06:48.0968] <danielrosenwasser>
* Pattern matching is cool, but other languages have this feature independent of pattern matching. There are plenty of times you want to bind a variable and check some specific condition that has nothing to do with truthiness

[22:06:54.0494] <bakkot>
best I've got is this:
```
let neededUpdate;
{
  using resource = getResource();
  if (resource.needsUpdate) {
    neededUpdate = true;
    resource.update();
  }
}
if (!neededUpdate) {
  await postMessage('no updates required');
}
```

[22:06:58.0026] <danielrosenwasser>
* Pattern matching is cool, but other languages have this feature independent of pattern matching. There are plenty of times you want to bind a variable and check some specific condition that has nothing to do with truthiness or a type check.

[22:06:58.0511] <rbuckton>
We discussed scoping awhile back in the pattern matching meetings with respect to `is` and `let` patterns. One of the problems with not having the binding be visible to an `else` has to do with inverting a condition, i.e., if you start with `if (x) A else B` and refactor to `if (!x) B else A`, you have to completely change how you write the code to bind the value

[22:10:49.0524] <danielrosenwasser>
It is a little funny that we might say "this thing can't be seen in an `else` but it's fine to see it in the `default` of a `switch`"

[22:11:36.0908] <bakkot>
I really think the argument from `using` against having the binding visible in the `else` is extremely strong, such that I would be opposed to the proposal going forward if the binding is visible in the `else`. Does anyone who thinks it should be visible in the `else` have thoughts on that specific topic?

[22:11:54.0229] <snek>
they're all standing in a circle talking rn

[22:12:31.0218] <danielrosenwasser>
I think I would have to do some reading on your concern there - is [this comment](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Declarations-in-Conditionals/issues/3#issuecomment-3458395454) the right starting pint?

[22:12:48.0556] <bakkot>
the one above that, really, yes

[22:12:55.0875] <bakkot>
also https://github.com/tc39/proposal-Declarations-in-Conditionals/issues/12#issuecomment-3517821049

[22:13:02.0901] <rbuckton>
Or with a helper function:
```
function getResourceIfNeedsUpdate() {
  using stack = new DisposableStack();
  const resource = stack.use(getResource());
  if (resource.needsUpdate) {
     stack.move();
     return resource;
  }
  return null;
}

if (using resource = getResourceIfNeedsUpdate()) {
  resource.update();
} else {
  await postMessage('no updates required');
}
```

[22:14:35.0010] <rbuckton>
Or more generalized:
```
function holdResourceIf(acquire, test) {
  using stack = new DisposableStack();
  const resource = stack.use(acquire());
  if (test(resource)) {
    stack.move();
    return resource;
  }
  return null;
}

if (using resource = holdResourceIf(() => getResource(), res => res.needsUpdate)) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

[22:15:00.0344] <Ashley Claymore>
I shouldn't have said TDZ, really my Q should have been:  would it be a syntax error to access the binding in the else? Or are the use cases conditional-shadowing-within-true-branch

[22:15:19.0916] <bakkot>
yeah, I think those examples make it very clear why it's better for the syntax to help out here

[22:15:21.0668] <Steve Hicks>
Ron mentioned pattern matching not supporting using - maybe this is where the two don't overlap?  I assume pattern matching would allow scoping something to the entire block, so if you wanted access in both branches you could use that, and if you need `using`, you use this?

[22:16:27.0949] <rbuckton>
And that generalized form is not unlike what a condition variable might do.

[22:16:30.0949] <snek>
i don't think its ever a syntax error to reference an undefined variable.

[22:16:47.0709] <snek>
* i don't think its ever a syntax error to reference an undeclared variable. it would be a reference error, unless something above the if had declared it.

[22:18:40.0515] <rbuckton>
IMO if you introduced bindings in `if` they would be similar to per-iteration bindings in a `for` loop, so scoped to the `if` statement (which might be considered to include the `else` clause)

[22:19:30.0621] <snek>
maybe `if (var)` can be the escape hatch for people who want the variable in their else branches

[22:19:34.0442] <snek>
* maybe `if (var x = ...)` can be the escape hatch for people who want the variable in their else branches

[22:19:37.0402] <bakkot>
I don't think there's good use cases but personally I would not make it a syntax error; just leave it to linters. I can imagine someone wanting to write

```
let data = whatever;
if (let data = updateOrNull()) {
  console.log('updated', data);
} else {
  console.log('not updated', data);
}
```
or something. probably they shouldn't but I don't think it's the language's place to forbid this

[22:20:08.0637] <danielrosenwasser>
It's a good point, it's a huge pain to make that resource dispose early. Definitely frustrating that the two use-cases are at odds.

[22:20:50.0480] <bakkot>
yeah but the use case when you want the binding visible is much, much easier to solve

[22:20:54.0557] <bakkot>
you just do the thing you'd do today

[22:21:08.0519] <bakkot>
whereas it's an actual significant upgrade on the use case where you want the binding not visible

[22:21:37.0609] <snek>
i don't understand why you would use a conditional binding but also want it to not be conditional. its not even the clearest way to write that code

[22:23:40.0151] <Olivier Flückiger>
```
let x = true;
if (let x = false) {} else {log(x)}
```

[22:25:35.0661] <rkirsling>
that is some yucky code

[22:26:18.0090] <snek>
you can write `let i = 4; for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}`

[22:27:16.0584] <bakkot>
```
let e = 0;
try { throw 1; } catch (e) { console.log(e) } finally { console.log(e) }
```
that's just how bindings work!

[22:27:56.0238] <Olivier Flückiger>
sure, I am saying that it is easier to understand visually where you refer to which binding...

[22:28:01.0245] <eemeli>
Why are we _still_ doing paper attendance sheets?

[22:28:04.0425] <Olivier Flückiger>

Programmers are known for making computers not work

[22:29:00.0434] <Olivier Flückiger>
Btw. we have a similar case in for. If the following was valid syntax: `for (let x = false; x; false) { } else { x }`, then `x` would be out of scope in the `else` case. But it is not valid syntax...

[22:29:42.0156] <Christian Ulbrich>

[22:29:57.0237] <Christian Ulbrich>
or - highly unlikely - a race condition in TCQ.

[22:29:57.0656] <waldemar>
I'm not that fast at typing.

[22:32:24.0062] <Christian Ulbrich>
FWIW if you accidentally double-clicked the submit, it gets send twice, because there is no logic in TCQ preventing that.

[22:33:17.0065] <rkirsling>
ooh

[22:33:24.0555] <rkirsling>
see now that deserves a bug report

[22:34:00.0183] <Chris de Almeida>

[22:36:24.0140] <snek>

[22:39:50.0739] <Christian Ulbrich>
Ugh. Never got them.

At least one physical sheet is now filled out completely next to Shane.

[22:44:55.0030] <rbuckton>
> <@olivf.o1o.ch:immer.chat> Btw. we have a similar case in for. If the following was valid syntax: `for (let x = false; x; false) { } else { x }`, then `x` would be out of scope in the `else` case. But it is not valid syntax...

Since that syntax doesn't exist, it's arguable in either direction.

[22:46:12.0309] <rbuckton>
The only other statement with split syntax like this is `do...while`, but there's no variable scoping involved

[22:46:24.0782] <ljharb>
there would be with the relevant proposal, tho

[22:46:55.0216] <bakkot>
`try {} catch (e) {} finally {}`

[22:47:14.0591] <ljharb>
`try {} catch (e) {} finally {} andthen {}`

[22:48:15.0962] <rkirsling>
`finallyer`

[22:48:19.0223] <rbuckton>
IMO, `catch` is a bit of a weird case, and `finally` is executed in *both* branches so it's not indicative 

[22:48:52.0738] <Ashley Claymore>
```
for x in range(3):
    print(x)
else:
    print('Final x = %d' % (x))
```

[22:49:14.0429] <Ashley Claymore>

(I've done almost zero python dev)

[22:50:16.0356] <Olivier Flückiger>

[22:50:26.0213] <Olivier Flückiger>
* haha, as a C programmer I was expecting it to print final = 3

[22:51:10.0547] <rkirsling>
I did not realize that was in Python

[22:51:31.0260] <Ashley Claymore>
I wasn't expecting the else to run at all. I thought `for-else` would be _for_ when the loop block never runs

[22:52:09.0711] <rkirsling>
oh wow yeah

[22:52:17.0469] <nicolo-ribaudo>
"Do this in an infinite loop, or else if you cannot go forever do this"

[22:52:20.0425] <rkirsling>
that's a broken use of a keyword if it doesn't mean that

[22:53:08.0540] <Ashley Claymore>
halt-or-else

[22:53:31.0816] <Michael Ficarra>
that would be identical to just putting it after the loop?

[22:53:56.0506] <rkirsling>
yeah but it's less a utility question and more a "what does the word else mean" question

[22:54:00.0211] <rbuckton>
if `using` had stuck with Java's `try`-with-resources then we might have a case. IIRC, In Java:
```java
try (FileReader r = new FileReader(...)) {
}
catch (IOException e) {
  // r is not reachable
}
```
But control-flow based on exceptions isn't quite the same as `if...else`

[22:54:03.0456] <rkirsling>
they should've chosen a different word

[22:54:16.0008] <rbuckton>

[22:55:13.0983] <bakkot>
it's for searching

[22:55:53.0723] <Ashley Claymore>
ah thanks. so `break` would skip the else

```
for x in range(3):
  if x == 2: break

"some files don't use UTF-8" is extra relevant at the Japan meeting

[23:16:05.0326] <Justin Ridgewell>
I think we should just assume UTF-8, and let `import bytes` to get a different encoding.

[23:21:26.0519] <Michael Ficarra>
consider windows-1252 @sffc:mozilla.org

[23:28:23.0090] <nicolo-ribaudo>

[23:28:39.0696] <nicolo-ribaudo>

i don't think "one PR" is of much value personally

[23:29:13.0678] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It's for the champions, they will conflict in half of their changes

[23:29:31.0291] <ljharb>
either way

[23:30:57.0244] <Olivier Flückiger>
Hmm, ok, I am confused about the import text proposal I think. A string can only contain utf-8 chars right now, right? at least string literals. So what would happen if you create a string with non utf-8 chars with import text?

[23:31:19.0151] <snek>
no, string literals in javascript are not limited to utf8

[23:31:41.0173] <nicolo-ribaudo>
String literals allow unpaired UTF-16 surrogate pairs

[23:31:48.0423] <nicolo-ribaudo>
But I think that's beyond the point of the discussion

[23:31:55.0028] <ljharb>
`'\xc3\x28'` is not UTF8 and is a valid JS string, eg

[23:31:59.0046] <ljharb>
* `'\xc3\x28'` is not UTF8 and is a valid JS string, eg (i believe)

[23:32:31.0645] <Michael Ficarra>
JavaScript strings are sequences of UTF-16 code units (numbers between 0 and 65535, inclusive)

[23:32:39.0445] <nicolo-ribaudo>
The question is: given some bytes, do we extract the charcodes out of them with UTF-8 rules, or do we allow following multiple encoding rules?

[23:32:41.0099] <Michael Ficarra>
I'm surprised more people don't think of them this way

[23:32:44.0602] <nicolo-ribaudo>
* The question is: given some bytes, do we extract the code units out of them with UTF-8 rules, or do we allow following multiple encoding rules?

[23:33:21.0502] <Michael Ficarra>
That's not the question though? It's just up to the host.

[23:33:41.0813] <Olivier Flückiger>
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-literals-string-literals

[23:33:42.0782] <nicolo-ribaudo>
The question was whether we want to give host guidance for these imports, no?

[23:34:00.0155] <Olivier Flückiger>
"A string literal is 0 or more Unicode code points enclosed in single or double quotes. Unicode code points may also be represented by an escape sequence."

[23:34:02.0357] <ljharb>
they already have to do that for modules, no?

[23:34:35.0266] <snek>
the normative requirement should be exactly "construct a javascript string". how the host implements such a construction is out of scope for ecma262 itself

[23:34:41.0612] <jkup>
the transcription quality is struggling.. not sure if that's worth stopping or just finish the rest of today?

[23:34:46.0164] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Let's say you have an encoding where A is 0x00, B is 0x01, ..., and you import a file that contains 0x00-0x01 that has that encoding. Is it fine if it results in the string "\u0000\u0001", even though it was meant to contain the string "AB"?

[23:34:49.0577] <Michael Ficarra>
Who is asking that question?

[23:34:54.0329] <nicolo-ribaudo>
That's what I understood the question to be

[23:34:55.0324] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Shane?

[23:35:08.0948] <nicolo-ribaudo>
If not, I did not understand what Shane was saying

[23:35:39.0099] <ljharb>
of course, you made your own homegrown encoding. you read it as text or bytes and interpret it yourself in that case, no?

[23:35:43.0331] <Michael Ficarra>
you and I both know literals are not the only way to construct strings

[23:36:00.0349] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It was for an example, assume it's some other known encoding

[23:36:10.0422] <nicolo-ribaudo>
To be clear, I want it to be UTF-8 only. I'm not representing my opinion

[23:36:14.0158] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It's what I got from the discussion

[23:37:31.0027] <Michael Ficarra>
I think the question was more like "is there something better we can do when the host uses the wrong encoding to decode the text?" and the answer is pretty easily "no", right?

[23:38:52.0702] <sffc>
If what people are saying about JSON imports being required to be UTF-8 is true, then a JSON file that is encoded on disk as UTF-16 BE will start with a NUL byte (or perhaps a BOM), which is invalid JSON, so the error happens early. But with import text, the conformant behavior would be to convert those bytes to replacement characters, and developers won't find out that there was an encoding problem. Implicit wrong encoding problems cause errors across many generations. Everyone here has seen garbled text on websites that results from the wrong encoding being used when reading bytes from a database or data file.

[23:39:37.0562] <nicolo-ribaudo>
CSS imports also assume UTF-8, but CSS is much more lenient and doesn't throw an error as far as I know

[23:39:58.0690] <nicolo-ribaudo>
I mean `type: "css"`

[23:40:10.0956] <Michael Ficarra>
@sffc:mozilla.org that's specifically with a mix-up between UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE, but there are many other encoding mixups that will cause mojibake in your string but overall still be valid JSON

[23:40:36.0569] <snek>
i'm very confused about where utf-8 is coming into this conversation for type text, is it because of type json?

[23:40:51.0634] <Michael Ficarra>
that's why I said consider windows-1252 and code points between 0x80 and 0xFF above

[23:41:27.0358] <sffc>
JSON is itself a text-based encoding. The first code point is { or [ or " or another syntax character, and it has the same encoding as the string values contained inside the JSON. This is different from binary encodings.

[23:42:03.0031] <nicolo-ribaudo>
But you need to first get that text from some bytes, no?

[23:42:36.0713] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It's bytes->text->json. You are saying "it's fine if bytes->text does the wrong thing because you are catching it at the next step", but MF pointed out that you won't always catch it at the next step

[23:44:02.0466] <Michael Ficarra>
yes and some encodings encode `{` and `[` and `"` the same as another encoding but encode `£` and `æ` the same

[23:44:40.0572] <sffc>
Yeah, like Latin-1, but not UTF-16

[23:44:43.0534] <Michael Ficarra>
so it's still valid JSON but the string data of the string that's encoded in the JSON is different because the wrong encoding was used to decode the JSON

[23:45:21.0215] <Michael Ficarra>
no, a latin-1 and UTF-16 mixup would not have this kind of behaviour

[23:45:25.0998] <Chris de Almeida>
we have been doing so well on time and have had to move a lot of topics up.  the downside is at this time, the day 2 and day 3 schedules are in rough shape.  we will update, but please be patient

[23:45:35.0707] <snek>
i feel like this conversation is being confused by the difference between abstract strings and utf8/utf16/etc strings

[23:46:01.0522] <Michael Ficarra>
wtf is an abstract string

[23:46:19.0945] <sffc>
A UTF-8 JSON parser might not fail on JSON stored as Latin-1. It should fail on JSON stored as UTF-16

[23:46:57.0736] <Michael Ficarra>
agreed, and?

[23:47:30.0382] <sffc>
And, then if the JSON file is encoded as UTF-16, then the error happens early

[23:47:34.0868] <Michael Ficarra>
a windows-1252 JSON parser will accept all JSON stored as latin-1 but some of it will have strings in the result that *are different*

[23:47:51.0855] <snek>
its not a thing in computer memory, its the theoretical characters. like the mathematical concept of numbers vs the concrete implementation of floating point.

[23:47:56.0850] <Michael Ficarra>
meaning there are no early errors

[23:47:57.0595] <snek>
idk if there's a better term

[23:48:06.0030] <Michael Ficarra>
it's just as fraught as text

[23:48:38.0654] <Michael Ficarra>
USV strings, or sequences of code points (ish)

[23:48:48.0865] <ljharb>
(ps, "the iterator protocol is crazy slow" is a strong use case for Array.zip)

[23:49:13.0328] <Michael Ficarra>
compelling case for engines to actually optimise their impleentations

[23:49:29.0694] <snek>
sequences of infinitely large code points, i guess? its not just restricted to how many characters there are in utf32 for example

[23:50:00.0903] <Michael Ficarra>
Unicode only defines 0x110000 code points

[23:50:12.0161] <snek>
i wouldn't think about it in terms of computer memory 

[23:50:22.0323] <snek>
* i wouldn't think about it in terms of computer memory or numbering characters

[23:50:35.0681] <Michael Ficarra>
so you mean... text?

[23:50:59.0043] <sffc>
You're saying that, since Windows-1252 encodes JSON syntax characters the same as UTF-8, then import type JSON gets a late error, which is the same as what will happen with import type Text. I agree that this is a true statement

[23:50:59.0886] <snek>
if that's the term for it

[23:51:53.0672] <Justin Ridgewell>
OMG byte offset is awful

[23:52:06.0700] <ljharb>
i'm not gonna hold my breath

[23:52:14.0978] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Process-wise, sffc is there any change you _maybe_ would want to see in the proposal itself, or is this about guiding the HTML integration?

[23:53:32.0301] <sffc>
The "true statement" above doesn't address my concern, other than asserting that one of the most likely environments where there would be an error (reading text files on Windows) already has this behavior with other import types

[23:54:50.0976] <Michael Ficarra>
@sffc:mozilla.org can you state your concern? @nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org and I were unsure about what it was

[23:56:06.0228] <sffc>
In plenary, I made an assertion that import type text has error cases that other import types don't have. The statement about Windows-1252 reduces the number of cases where this happens, but it is still happens for encodings like UTF-16 BE.

[23:56:19.0006] <sffc>

[23:58:37.0838] <Michael Ficarra>
if something "sometimes has a problem", it means we always need to consider the problem if we want to do it right

[23:59:03.0700] <Michael Ficarra>
so given there exists at least one pair of encodings where this problem could happen, it's just as important of a problem as the text mixup
