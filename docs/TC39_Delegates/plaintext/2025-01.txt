are there docs for suggesting timeboxes anywhere or are past meetings my best bet?

[18:01:40.0154] <ljharb>
it’s just based on how much time you think you’ll need

[18:02:36.0731] <canadahonk>
also just wondering from looking at february's agenda, is there a particular reason you use stage -1 vs 0?

> <@canadahonk:matrix.org> also just wondering from looking at february's agenda, is there a particular reason you use stage -1 vs 0?

Just FYI, there is no stage -1. The first stage is Stage 0. It has no entrance criteria and it is self-assigned by the proposal author. See https://tc39.es/process-document/

[11:06:44.0953] <ljharb>
By convention only, until it’s on an agenda with a champion it’s not stage 0 yet, otherwise everyone in earth’s random ideas are stage 0

[11:34:39.0649] <Ashley Claymore>
Wouldn't "on an agenda with a champion" be "entrance criteria", which the document says there are none.
An idea on the back of a napkin being stage 0 sounds OK to me

[13:40:48.0065] <ljharb>
yes, which is why i said by convention

[13:41:14.0943] <ljharb>
considering every random idea stage 0 makes the category useless, which is why the proposals repo has used the convention i described as its filter.

You've asserted that this is the convention, and follow it in the proposal repo, but I still think of Stage 0 as not really a stage with criteria. When people refer to Stage 0, I think of it as a semi-joke, just a statement of it not being at a stage in committee. It can still be useful to link to those in the proposals repo, sometimes, and I'm fine with applying those criteria for this list.

[07:54:52.0186] <littledan>
in general, I would like to reduce the places where we assert authority of the committee. Of course you need committee consensus to get to any real stage, including Stage 1, but I don't like it if people in the external parts of the community see something like "finding a champion so it can become stage 0" as some big important barrier/goal.

[10:12:03.0786] <ljharb>
what’s the point of having a category with no entrance criteria tho? my breakfast is stage 0.

[10:19:13.0484] <Andreu Botella>
I see stage 0 as the complement of stages 1-4

[10:19:26.0126] <Andreu Botella>
 * I see stage 0 as the set-theoretical complement of stages 1-4

[10:59:24.0453] <littledan>
the broader domain is, "TC39 proposals", so breakfast is not included :)

[11:02:47.0585] <Andreu Botella>
I don't care if a rock is Stage 0 tbh /j

[11:03:08.0132] <ljharb>
i guess what i mean is, if we really don't care that literally anything is stage  0, why even have that stage in the process doc

[11:03:37.0986] <Chris de Almeida>
who said we don't care?

[11:04:23.0558] <Chris de Almeida>
* gotta call it something, no?

[11:10:52.0979] <Chris de Almeida>
A young developer approached the delegate and asked,
"Delegate, what does it mean for a proposal to be at Stage 0?"

The delegate replied,
"Stage 0 is not a stage. It is the stage before stages, where all stages dissolve."

The developer pondered this and said,
"Then, is a Stage 0 proposal truly a proposal?"

The delegate smiled and poured tea into an empty cup, letting it overflow.
"Does the cup hold tea, or is it merely a vessel for possibility?"

At this, the developer was enlightened.

[11:21:53.0697] <shu>
the cup holds tea

[11:23:28.0741] <Chris de Almeida>
The delegate laughed softly and said,
"Ah, but does it? Or does it only seem to, until the tea is poured, spilled, or evaporates?

Stage 0 is like the cup before the tea—ready to hold, but not yet holding.
What you call 'tea' may one day be water, wine, or emptiness.

So tell me, is the cup full, or is it waiting?"

The developer replied,
"Perhaps it is not the tea, nor the cup, but the act of pouring that matters."

[11:24:06.0793] <shu>
i want off this llm ride

[11:24:12.0938] <Chris de Almeida>
fair

[14:22:34.0379] <littledan>
well, this is backwards: we were using Stage 0 as this informal thing, and then we added it to the stage process to help people understand what we were talking about. we should document it somewhere or other if we can't get people to stop referring to it.

(not that i think this is worth trying to change the process doc) but i think what's actually pretty intuitive and commonly believed is that "stage -1" is the thing with no criteria, and stage 0 does in fact have *some* criteria. a large percentage of the community ideas in esdiscuss and the discourse describe their thing as "stage -1"

[16:32:04.0619] <ljharb>
(perhaps because in JS, 0 is the first thing, and -1 is a nonexistent thing, so things that aren't a thing shouldn't have 0, they should have -1)

[08:13:25.0208] <littledan>
well, let's see if we can come to a common answer here; actively disagreeing within the committee just leaves things confusing.

[08:13:37.0764] <littledan>
from my perspective, both answers are potentially valid, we just need a convention

[08:14:43.0631] <littledan>
(this poll is of course non-binding/inconclusive, just to get a temperature)

***Reminder:***  The next plenary meeting is in 6 weeks time!  Please complete [the sign-up form](https://github.com/tc39/Reflector/issues/547) if you will attend in-person in Seattle.

[10:38:29.0307] <ljharb>
i mean per the process document it's objectively stage zero that has no entrance criteria :-)

[10:38:53.0003] <ljharb>
i'm talking about the general mental model outside the committee, which we probably can't poll the committee to confirm

[10:44:01.0867] <Chris de Almeida>
I don't think codifying further (including defining stage -1 vs stage 0, etc) would add any notable value

[11:06:52.0521] <littledan>
seems like we have some degree of consensus on this definition
