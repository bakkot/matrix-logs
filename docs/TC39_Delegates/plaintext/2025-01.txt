are there docs for suggesting timeboxes anywhere or are past meetings my best bet?

it’s just based on how much time you think you’ll need

also just wondering from looking at february's agenda, is there a particular reason you use stage -1 vs 0?

Just FYI, there is no stage -1. The first stage is Stage 0. It has no entrance criteria and it is self-assigned by the proposal author. See https://tc39.es/process-document/

By convention only, until it’s on an agenda with a champion it’s not stage 0 yet, otherwise everyone in earth’s random ideas are stage 0

[11:34:39.0649] <Ashley Claymore>
Wouldn't "on an agenda with a champion" be "entrance criteria", which the document says there are none.
An idea on the back of a napkin being stage 0 sounds OK to me

[13:40:48.0065] <ljharb>
yes, which is why i said by convention

[13:41:14.0943] <ljharb>
considering every random idea stage 0 makes the category useless, which is why the proposals repo has used the convention i described as its filter.
