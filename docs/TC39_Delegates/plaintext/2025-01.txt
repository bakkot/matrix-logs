are there docs for suggesting timeboxes anywhere or are past meetings my best bet?

it’s just based on how much time you think you’ll need

[18:02:36.0731] <canadahonk>
also just wondering from looking at february's agenda, is there a particular reason you use stage -1 vs 0?

Just FYI, there is no stage -1. The first stage is Stage 0. It has no entrance criteria and it is self-assigned by the proposal author. See https://tc39.es/process-document/

[11:06:44.0953] <ljharb>
By convention only, until it’s on an agenda with a champion it’s not stage 0 yet, otherwise everyone in earth’s random ideas are stage 0

[11:34:39.0649] <Ashley Claymore>
Wouldn't "on an agenda with a champion" be "entrance criteria", which the document says there are none.
An idea on the back of a napkin being stage 0 sounds OK to me

[13:40:48.0065] <ljharb>
yes, which is why i said by convention

[13:41:14.0943] <ljharb>
considering every random idea stage 0 makes the category useless, which is why the proposals repo has used the convention i described as its filter.

You've asserted that this is the convention, and follow it in the proposal repo, but I still think of Stage 0 as not really a stage with criteria. When people refer to Stage 0, I think of it as a semi-joke, just a statement of it not being at a stage in committee. It can still be useful to link to those in the proposals repo, sometimes, and I'm fine with applying those criteria for this list.

[07:54:52.0186] <littledan>
in general, I would like to reduce the places where we assert authority of the committee. Of course you need committee consensus to get to any real stage, including Stage 1, but I don't like it if people in the external parts of the community see something like "finding a champion so it can become stage 0" as some big important barrier/goal.

[10:12:03.0786] <ljharb>
what’s the point of having a category with no entrance criteria tho? my breakfast is stage 0.

[10:19:13.0484] <Andreu Botella>
I see stage 0 as the complement of stages 1-4

[10:19:26.0126] <Andreu Botella>
 * I see stage 0 as the set-theoretical complement of stages 1-4

[10:59:24.0453] <littledan>
the broader domain is, "TC39 proposals", so breakfast is not included :)

[11:02:47.0585] <Andreu Botella>
I don't care if a rock is Stage 0 tbh /j

[11:03:08.0132] <ljharb>
i guess what i mean is, if we really don't care that literally anything is stage  0, why even have that stage in the process doc

[11:03:37.0986] <Chris de Almeida>
who said we don't care?

[11:04:23.0558] <Chris de Almeida>
* gotta call it something, no?

A young developer approached the delegate and asked,
"Delegate, what does it mean for a proposal to be at Stage 0?"

The delegate replied,
"Stage 0 is not a stage. It is the stage before stages, where all stages dissolve."

The developer pondered this and said,
"Then, is a Stage 0 proposal truly a proposal?"

The delegate smiled and poured tea into an empty cup, letting it overflow.
"Does the cup hold tea, or is it merely a vessel for possibility?"

At this, the developer was enlightened.
