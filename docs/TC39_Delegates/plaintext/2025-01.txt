are there docs for suggesting timeboxes anywhere or are past meetings my best bet?

it’s just based on how much time you think you’ll need

also just wondering from looking at february's agenda, is there a particular reason you use stage -1 vs 0?

Just FYI, there is no stage -1. The first stage is Stage 0. It has no entrance criteria and it is self-assigned by the proposal author. See https://tc39.es/process-document/

By convention only, until it’s on an agenda with a champion it’s not stage 0 yet, otherwise everyone in earth’s random ideas are stage 0

[11:34:39.0649] <Ashley Claymore>
Wouldn't "on an agenda with a champion" be "entrance criteria", which the document says there are none.
An idea on the back of a napkin being stage 0 sounds OK to me

[13:40:48.0065] <ljharb>
yes, which is why i said by convention

[13:41:14.0943] <ljharb>
considering every random idea stage 0 makes the category useless, which is why the proposals repo has used the convention i described as its filter.

You've asserted that this is the convention, and follow it in the proposal repo, but I still think of Stage 0 as not really a stage with criteria. When people refer to Stage 0, I think of it as a semi-joke, just a statement of it not being at a stage in committee. It can still be useful to link to those in the proposals repo, sometimes, and I'm fine with applying those criteria for this list.

[07:54:52.0186] <littledan>
in general, I would like to reduce the places where we assert authority of the committee. Of course you need committee consensus to get to any real stage, including Stage 1, but I don't like it if people in the external parts of the community see something like "finding a champion so it can become stage 0" as some big important barrier/goal.
