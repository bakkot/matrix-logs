i should like to be present for shadowrealms but tbqh i don't know if i'll be able to stay awake until then

 * can someone let me in to the meet? Rob Palmer ryzokuken bterlson 

[01:09:42.0465] <Luca Casonato>
bakkot: can you add `amazing iterator` -> `async iterator`?

[01:19:01.0217] <ljharb>
bterlson: advance queue?

already 15 min ahead!

Wouldn't this be also the first time, that we would have a ~_keyword_~operator being extended / giving a `.` ? `await` is not a normal function but sth. _magical_ like `delete`?

[01:38:14.0029] <ljharb>
no, we have `new.target`

[01:38:16.0649] <ljharb>
and `super.whatever`

[01:38:24.0849] <rbuckton>
and `import.meta`

[01:38:29.0365] <ljharb>
metaproperties are already A Thing

[01:40:01.0298] <Christian Ulbrich>
`super.whatever` is used like a magical function and `new.target` is a magical property. `import.meta` a magical global.

[01:40:21.0431] <yulia>
speaking of research -- anyone wanna take over running that call?

[01:42:11.0843] <Christian Ulbrich>
I can relate to the idea of hiding Promises, but it would come at the cost of having - IMO - at the cost of another magical thing, that we do not have so far.

[01:43:37.0048] <Christian Ulbrich>
 * `super.whatever` is used like a _magical_ **function** and `new.target` is a _magical_ **property**. `import.meta` a _magical_ **global**.

[01:44:40.0090] <ljharb>
it could be an `awaitAll` keyword and it'd be the same

[01:44:44.0490] <yulia>
we have issues with sound in the room?

[01:44:58.0460] <ljharb>
`await.all` isn't magical, it's just a way to nest keywords under keyords in this case

[01:44:58.0678] <bakkot>
`await.all [a, b, c]` just doesn't seem that different from `await Promise.all([a, b, c])` to me

[01:45:00.0480] <rbuckton>
async/await isn't about hiding promises. It's about taking continuation passing style code and allowing you to write it as linear code so that you can maintain the benefit of existing control flow constructs like `continue`/`break`/`return`/`yield`.

[01:45:20.0890] <yulia>
what is being highlighted right now is the issue of breaking consistency in a language -- new developers will have a hard time keeping two things in mind

[01:45:30.0278] <ljharb>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> `await.all [a, b, c]` just doesn't seem that different from `await Promise.all([a, b, c])` to me

sure, i do the latter all the time, but in my experience devs in fact consider those quite different, and avoid the latter in favor of `await a; await b; await c` *constantly*

[01:45:31.0280] <yulia>
I would question teaching async/await before promises for this reason

[01:45:45.0867] <yulia>
i don't think the solution here is syntax

[01:46:00.0430] <Christian Ulbrich>
In other words, is there so far any `await`-like thing with a `.`?

[01:46:18.0765] <ljharb>
Christian Ulbrich: no, in that respect it'd be something new, but almost every new syntax feature has that :-)

[01:46:30.0645] <ljharb>
yulia: i totally agree this doesn't fix the education problem. to me it's fixing an ergonomics problem.

[01:46:33.0799] <Alex Vincent>
DevMo has a great example of how to do promises in sequence via Array.prototype.reduce

[01:46:36.0953] <bakkot>
ljharb I definitely see people do `await a; await b; await c` over `await Promise.all` but I have generally assumed it was because of thinking serially rather than because of wanting to avoid `Promise`?

[01:46:46.0696] <yulia>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> yulia: i totally agree this doesn't fix the education problem. to me it's fixing an ergonomics problem.

the ergonomics issue is relying on learners to make its poinit

[01:46:48.0438] <bakkot>
"wanting to avoid `Promise`" seems like a problem we should not be trying to solve for them

[01:46:49.0924] <yulia>
you just did so as well

[01:46:55.0423] <Kris Kowal>
I imagine `for await all` would take a lot of pressure off of `await.all`.

[01:46:57.0868] <yulia>
i don't agree that this is a solution

[01:47:02.0745] <ljharb>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> ljharb I definitely see people do `await a; await b; await c` over `await Promise.all` but I have generally assumed it was because of thinking serially rather than because of wanting to avoid `Promise`?

my experience is that most of the time they don't need to be serial, and that they didn't want to deal with the ceremony of Promise.all

[01:47:12.0974] <Christian Ulbrich>
Motivate a change to "unconfuse" developers from Promises by adding a totally new syntax, should be well-thought of.

this rings true to me

[01:48:00.0795] <shu>
i reckon beginners are not at a place that _would_ reach for parallel combinators but for a more discoverable way to do so, like syntax, or something

[01:48:08.0880] <shu>
they're just not at a place to reason about things in parallel

[01:48:21.0279] <Christian Ulbrich>
Concerning the hiding motivation, it actually is a problem that have all the time with junior developers, they already do not know, that they are using promises...

[01:48:49.0535] <Kris Kowal>
I agree with Yulia that promises should be taught before async/await. I agree with rbuckton that the latter is not to hide the former.

[01:49:11.0153] <HE Shi-Jun>
if the main problem is await all, should we only add `await.all` without `await.race` and others? Or even just introduce a special syntax (eg. `await* promises`)?

[01:49:15.0358] <shu>
first we must teach one of the First Mistakes -- the existence of the microtask queue

[01:49:22.0678] <Christian Ulbrich>
shu: The whole Playwright API is heavily _async_...

[01:49:48.0922] <shu>
Christian Ulbrich: sorry what's the context of that comment? i don't know what that means

[01:50:07.0352] <Kris Kowal>

that would still be better than the status quo, but i think that'd be an unfortunate inconsistency

[01:51:43.0848] <Alex Vincent>
"do nothing" is always an option.

[01:51:46.0985] <HE Shi-Jun>
ljharb: if syntax, there is no inconsistency?

[01:52:37.0597] <ljharb>
the inconsistency would be 3 of the promise combinators lacking syntax, but 1 having it
