already 15 min ahead!

Wouldn't this be also the first time, that we would have a ~_keyword_~operator being extended / giving a `.` ? `await` is not a normal function but sth. _magical_ like `delete`?

[01:38:14.0029] <ljharb>
no, we have `new.target`

[01:38:16.0649] <ljharb>
and `super.whatever`

[01:38:24.0849] <rbuckton>
and `import.meta`

[01:38:29.0365] <ljharb>
metaproperties are already A Thing

[01:40:01.0298] <Christian Ulbrich>
`super.whatever` is used like a magical function and `new.target` is a magical property. `import.meta` a magical global.

[01:40:21.0431] <yulia>
speaking of research -- anyone wanna take over running that call?

[01:42:11.0843] <Christian Ulbrich>
I can relate to the idea of hiding Promises, but it would come at the cost of having - IMO - at the cost of another magical thing, that we do not have so far.

[01:43:37.0048] <Christian Ulbrich>
 * `super.whatever` is used like a _magical_ **function** and `new.target` is a _magical_ **property**. `import.meta` a _magical_ **global**.

[01:44:40.0090] <ljharb>
it could be an `awaitAll` keyword and it'd be the same

[01:44:44.0490] <yulia>
we have issues with sound in the room?

[01:44:58.0460] <ljharb>
`await.all` isn't magical, it's just a way to nest keywords under keyords in this case

[01:44:58.0678] <bakkot>
`await.all [a, b, c]` just doesn't seem that different from `await Promise.all([a, b, c])` to me

[01:45:00.0480] <rbuckton>
async/await isn't about hiding promises. It's about taking continuation passing style code and allowing you to write it as linear code so that you can maintain the benefit of existing control flow constructs like `continue`/`break`/`return`/`yield`.
