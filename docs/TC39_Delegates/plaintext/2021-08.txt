I’d like to champion my first (small) proposal (as a delegate from Indiana University) and get it added to the August meeting’s agenda. I’ve never done this before—do I just open a pull request to tc39/agendas?
 (The proposal is at https://github.com/js-choi/proposal-array-async-from, with specification at https://jschoi.org/21/es-array-async-from/. No slides yet.)

jschoi: yup, that's all! you do need to open the PR >= 10 days before the meeting, so people get a chance to review, but you've got another couple of weeks before that deadline

(though earlier is better, of course)

bakkot: Thank you!
