ljharb: the github pages deploy seems to be broken

[18:09:25.0852] <bakkot>
seems to be hitting https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/f4694412639e19acab2c0dd5baac247aa7d7a889/scripts/auto-deploy.sh#L6-L7

Richard Gibson leobalter who's doing the 402 update?

[12:10:27.0457] <Aki>
is anyone giving a test262 update?

In case anyone wants to figure out when the plenary meeting is in their own time zone (accurately adjusting for DST, of course!), I heard there's a cool ECMAScript API you can use for that. üòÄ  

Just go to https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/ and open the devtools console in the browser. Just substitute your own time zone and optionally how long after the start of the meeting.

```
Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2021-07-13T10:00[Asia/Tokyo]')
  .withTimeZone('America/Los_Angeles')
  .add({minutes: 160})
// => 2021-07-12T20:40:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
```


[18:29:30.0256] <ryzokuken>
justingrant can you use `Temporal.now.timeZone()` instead? 

[18:29:52.0546] <justingrant>
Oh, good point!  I'll edit.

tcq is back! ü•≥

[18:10:05.0201] <bterlson>
Yes sorry about TCQ friends. Freak accident combined with paternity leave was a bad combo :-P

[18:12:14.0011] <Justin Ridgewell>
Can an admin update the Reflector link in the room description?

Does anyone know what the current status of archival is, in terms of whether we're managing to archive everything in our GitHub org, and how to access the archives?

[18:34:31.0785] <ryzokuken>
why are there multiple JSON standards? I thought ECMA-404 was the "canonical" JSON standard but apparently IETF has its own JSON?

[18:35:24.0592] <littledan>
everyone considers their own standard canonical!

[18:35:59.0357] <ryzokuken>
well, let me rephrase, I thought JSON was TC39's domain...

[18:36:04.0855] <ryzokuken>
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259 btw

[18:36:15.0574] <ljharb>
a musical canon of standards / a round of JSON?

[18:36:42.0852] <ljharb>
 * a musical canon of standards / a round of JSON?

[18:37:29.0282] <bterlson>
I see them as complimentary standards. ECMA402 is very conservative, describes syntax mechanically, doesn't add much editorial fluff or advisory information

[18:37:33.0036] <ryzokuken>
wonder if there's any difference between the two standards: if the IETF standard is a subset/profile then I guess that's not _that_ unexpected.

[18:37:57.0016] <bterlson>
I use 8259 when I need to show people why it's a bad idea to use the complete grammar in ECMA-404

[18:38:06.0137] <bterlson>

[18:38:16.0203] <HE Shi-Jun>
JSON is cross language/platform :)

[18:38:53.0763] <bterlson>
e.g. if you expect precision greater than IEEE754 doubles, , you're going to have a bad time, and RFC8259 helpfully calls that out

[18:39:49.0187] <ryzokuken>
thanks for pointing out the differences. Is something on that published somewhere? (maybe you should write something, it'll be useful üôà)

[18:40:33.0034] <ryzokuken>
but I generally expected the IETF standard to be more... concise. This is definitely a fun data point!

[18:43:37.0212] <ryzokuken>
the next IETF meeting (november 2021) is supposed to be in-person...

[18:43:44.0653] <bterlson>
You can ctrl+f rfc8259 for the phrase "interoperable in the sense that" to see the places where IETF suggested you avoid some corner of JSON

[18:43:46.0187] <Richard Gibson>
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-1.2 includes explicit reconciliation:
> The reference to ECMA-404 in the previous sentence is normative, not with the usual meaning that implementors need to consult it in order to understand this document, but to emphasize that there are no inconsistencies in the definition of the term "JSON text" in any of its specifications... If there is a difference found between them, ECMA and the IETF will work together to update both documents.

[18:43:52.0802] <HE Shi-Jun>
Yeah, JSON itself do not support specific type, there is always confusion/complain about int64

[18:44:39.0796] <ryzokuken>
> <@bterlson:matrix.org> You can ctrl+f rfc8259 for the phrase "interoperable in the sense that" to see the places where IETF suggested you avoid some corner of JSON

neat, thanks!

[18:44:52.0424] <HE Shi-Jun>
We also have the trouble of serialization of BigInt/Date/etc.

[18:45:26.0113] <ryzokuken>
HE Shi-Jun: what's wrong with ISO8601/RFC3339 for Date serialization?

[18:45:49.0443] <bterlson>
One problem we run in to is you need to know schema to know whether to treat a string value as a date value

[18:46:09.0198] <HE Shi-Jun>
The problem is you don't know whether it's a date value or string :playful:

[18:46:18.0339] <bterlson>
implementations which detect date-like strings and convert to date types have been highly problematic in the past

[18:47:24.0772] <bterlson>
int64 has similar problems - there is no good option. You encode as a number literal and lose precision as the json document traverses a JS runtime. Or you encode as a string and you either need schema or users have to deal with converting to int64 themselves.

Previously I wrote a JSON hint proposal ( https://gist.github.com/hax/5691ca8acdf9179e63043857cdc3616b ) to solve the problem in general , does anyone interest in that?

that does sound cool, thanks

[18:48:33.0167] <ryzokuken>
well I dunno what's so wrong assuming valid ISO8601 strings were dates? but I might be missing something here

[18:48:57.0690] <bterlson>
There are many problems üòÅ

[18:49:12.0895] <bterlson>
For example, performance - you are now attempting to parse every string field.

[18:49:44.0397] <ryzokuken>
well, I'm running a regex over every field

[18:49:47.0258] <bterlson>
also, it can become unpredictable what the type of a field actually is - if I so happen to have data that matches the ISO8601 grammar, all of a sudden things are dates, but if not, its strings.

[18:49:54.0956] <ryzokuken>
and parsing if it matches the regex
