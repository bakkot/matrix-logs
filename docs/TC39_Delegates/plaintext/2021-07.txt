In case anyone wants to figure out when the plenary meeting is in their own time zone (accurately adjusting for DST, of course!), I heard there's a cool ECMAScript API you can use for that. ðŸ˜€  

Just go to https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/ and open the devtools console in the browser. Just substitute your own time zone and optionally how long after the start of the meeting.

```
Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2021-07-13T10:00[Asia/Tokyo]')
  .withTimeZone('America/Los_Angeles')
  .add({minutes: 160})
// => 2021-07-12T20:40:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
```


[18:29:30.0256] <ryzokuken>
justingrant can you use `Temporal.now.timeZone()` instead? 

[18:29:52.0546] <justingrant>
Oh, good point!  I'll edit.

Just go to https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/ and open the devtools console in the browser. Optionally, you can add some time after the start of the meeting.
```
Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2021-07-13T10:00[Asia/Tokyo]')
  .withTimeZone(Temporal.now.timeZone()) // your system time zone
  .add({minutes: 160})
// => 2021-07-12T20:40:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]
