https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields is still getting new comments despite it being Stage 4. It should get archived, right?

[07:43:41.0033] <Rob Palmer>
maybe ljharb (our Administrator-to-be) would like to handle that

[07:53:49.0672] <ljharb>
Yup, that is the first thing on my list

FYI, the State of JS people have reached out to TC39 at https://es.discourse.group/t/help-shape-the-contents-of-the-next-state-of-js-survey/1148 asking what sort of questions they should be asking for the upcoming community survey. This might be really useful.

Only three proposals made today's deadline for possible advancement at this month's TC39 meeting. Looks like it's going to be a short meeting…

[09:17:48.0808] <ljharb>
i count 4 for advancement, but indeed there'll be a lot of time that could be filled with updates and discussions

[12:00:22.0129] <jschoi>
It might be worth offloading some of the chartered incubator topics into plenary, if there’s lots of room. https://github.com/tc39/incubator-agendas/issues/22


[12:00:22.0989] <jschoi>

https://github.com/tc39/process-document/pull/33 might also be worth discussing.

jschoi: agreed, i haven't had time to run any calls at all between last meeting and this one

Ah, enum for stage 1 was in the "open-ended discussion category" instead of in the proposals.

I thought TC39 was this week…

[11:03:26.0610] <Justin Ridgewell>
Anyways, TCQ's SSL cert is expired.

[11:03:34.0367] <Justin Ridgewell>
We should fix that before plenary.
