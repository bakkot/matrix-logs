Probably not, but just in case…
Is there a way for ecmarkup to become aware of definitions from Ecma262 pull requests? I want a proposal spec to refer to the Decorator productions from #2417—and I want to suppress the grammar-shape errors resulting from the spec referring to those productions.

jschoi: check out the pr, run `ecmarkup --verbose --write-biblio whatever.json spec.html > /dev/null`; this will produce a `whatever.json` biblio file. in your proposal, do `ecmarkup --load-biblio ./whatever.json your-proposal.html`.

[21:16:09.0033] <bakkot>
that said I am halfway through making a breaking change to the biblio format so you might want to wait a couple days

(the `./` is import because otherwise ecmarkup will attempt to load a node module named `whatever.json` which is not the thing you want)

[21:17:24.0349] <bakkot>
this requires a recent (v10/v11) version of ecmarkup, I should mention

[21:17:45.0353] <bakkot>
uh, but that might not actually fix your problem

[21:18:00.0025] <bakkot>
because some of the checks are from grammarkdown, which doesn't really know about the biblio

[21:20:23.0621] <jschoi>
Thank you very much! I think the PR’s biblio file will be sufficient. Looking forward to the biblio-format upgrade.

it is just a small tweak to make it better for other tooling: https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/pull/425

[21:21:03.0960] <jschoi>
This will be a v12?

[21:21:18.0841] <bakkot>
https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/releases/tag/v12.0.0

[21:21:36.0504] <bakkot>
but there's a bug to do with https://github.com/tc39/ecmarkup/pull/426 that I gotta fix before this is actually usable

[21:21:41.0717] <bakkot>
so stick with 11 for now
