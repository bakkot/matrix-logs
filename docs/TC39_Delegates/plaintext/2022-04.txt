Probably not, but just in case…
Is there a way for ecmarkup to become aware of definitions from Ecma262 pull requests? I want a proposal spec to refer to the Decorator productions from #2417—and I want to suppress the grammar-shape errors resulting from the spec referring to those productions.

jschoi: check out the pr, run `ecmarkup --verbose --write-biblio whatever.json spec.html > /dev/null`; this will produce a `whatever.json` biblio file. in your proposal, do `ecmarkup --load-biblio ./whatever.json your-proposal.html`.

that said I am halfway through making a breaking change to the biblio format so you might want to wait a couple days

(the `./` is import because otherwise ecmarkup will attempt to load a node module named `whatever.json` which is not the thing you want)

[21:17:24.0349] <bakkot>
this requires a recent (v10/v11) version of ecmarkup, I should mention

[21:17:45.0353] <bakkot>
uh, but that might not actually fix your problem

[21:18:00.0025] <bakkot>
because some of the checks are from grammarkdown, which doesn't really know about the biblio
