Could someone with permissions to tc39-transfer finish the transfer process for the proposals that advanced to Stage 1 last meeting?

Aki: bterlson: Rob Palmer: ^ (would also appreciate finalizing transfer of structs, which i forgot to transfer to tc39-transfers after last meeting)

Also when possible, I would like a chair to turn on GitHub Actions in proposals-bigint-math and proposals-array-fromasync and switch their repository homepages to their spec pages on tc39.github.com.

github actions should be automatically on for everything, is it not?
