Could someone with permissions to tc39-transfer finish the transfer process for the proposals that advanced to Stage 1 last meeting?

[13:03:36.0121] <ljharb>
(that'd be the chairs)

Aki: bterlson: Rob Palmer: ^ (would also appreciate finalizing transfer of structs, which i forgot to transfer to tc39-transfers after last meeting)

[15:44:48.0796] <jschoi>
Also when possible, I would like a chair to turn on GitHub Actions in proposals-bigint-math and proposals-array-fromasync and switch their repository homepages to their spec pages on tc39.github.com.

github actions should be automatically on for everything, is it not?

shu: what's `Atomics.waitAsync` waiting on? just a second implementation? 

[11:40:55.0600] <shu>
correct

[11:41:13.0789] <shu>
it is actually pretty tricky to implement, and the use case is fairly niche, so probably not prioritized

[11:41:23.0079] <shu>
you have a use case?

[11:45:55.0297] <bakkot>
not really

[11:46:02.0472] <bakkot>
I was just going to publish a pure-JS `setTimeout` polyfill

[11:48:38.0474] <shu>
ah

What was the deadline for October-plenary notes edits, again? I was planning to edit them over the weekend.

[11:55:35.0313] <bakkot>
jschoi: "They will be published on November 11th" per the reflector

[11:55:50.0143] <bakkot>
though I imagine you could ask to hold off a couple of days to get your edits in

I'm happy to delay publishing until Monday.

GitHub Actions are not active for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint-math/. (I was wrong about proposal-array-from-async, though. Actions are active on that oneâ€”although, for some reason, https://tc39.github.io/proposal-array-from-async/ doesnâ€™t work.)

[16:14:26.0880] <bakkot>
jschoi: presumably you don't have github pages on, which is a distinct thing from having github actions on

[16:16:13.0555] <jschoi>

Ah yeah, thatâ€™s right. Thatâ€™s under repository settings, right? 

So I have two TC39 repositories in which the GitHub Pages option needs to be turned on, as well as editing the repository home page. One repository also needs to have Actions turned on.

[16:17:18.0623] <ljharb>
If youâ€™re an admin on those repos you can do it yourself; if not, then thatâ€™s the ask id make of the chairs :-)

[16:18:01.0634] <jschoi>
Yes, I would like to be made admin of those repositories by a chair. Iâ€™ve pinged before but theyâ€™re busy, and itâ€™s not urgent anyway. ðŸ˜„

unfortunately when you transfer your own repo to an org, you lose admin rights on it by default; i usually try to restore those rights while it's in tc39-transfer but sometimes the chairs transfer the repos before i get to it
