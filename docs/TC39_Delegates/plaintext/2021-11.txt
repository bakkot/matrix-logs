Could someone with permissions to tc39-transfer finish the transfer process for the proposals that advanced to Stage 1 last meeting?

[13:03:36.0121] <ljharb>
(that'd be the chairs)

[15:30:52.0344] <shu>
Aki: bterlson: Rob Palmer: ^ (would also appreciate finalizing transfer of structs, which i forgot to transfer to tc39-transfers after last meeting)

[15:44:48.0796] <jschoi>
Also when possible, I would like a chair to turn on GitHub Actions in proposals-bigint-math and proposals-array-fromasync and switch their repository homepages to their spec pages on tc39.github.com.

github actions should be automatically on for everything, is it not?

[11:40:20.0464] <bakkot>
shu: what's `Atomics.waitAsync` waiting on? just a second implementation? 

[11:40:55.0600] <shu>
correct

[11:41:13.0789] <shu>
it is actually pretty tricky to implement, and the use case is fairly niche, so probably not prioritized

[11:41:23.0079] <shu>
you have a use case?

[11:45:55.0297] <bakkot>
not really

[11:46:02.0472] <bakkot>
I was just going to publish a pure-JS `setTimeout` polyfill

[11:48:38.0474] <shu>
ah

What was the deadline for October-plenary notes edits, again? I was planning to edit them over the weekend.

[11:55:35.0313] <bakkot>
jschoi: "They will be published on November 11th" per the reflector

[11:55:50.0143] <bakkot>
though I imagine you could ask to hold off a couple of days to get your edits in

I'm happy to delay publishing until Monday. 

[16:08:08.0055] <jschoi>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> github actions should be automatically on for everything, is it not?

GitHub Actions are not active for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint-math/. (I was wrong about proposal-array-from-async, though. Actions are active on that one‚Äîalthough, for some reason, https://tc39.github.io/proposal-array-from-async/ doesn‚Äôt work.)

[16:14:26.0880] <bakkot>
jschoi: presumably you don't have github pages on, which is a distinct thing from having github actions on

[16:16:13.0555] <jschoi>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> jschoi: presumably you don't have github pages on, which is a distinct thing from having github actions on

Ah yeah, that‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs under repository settings, right? 

So I have two TC39 repositories in which the GitHub Pages option needs to be turned on, as well as editing the repository home page. One repository also needs to have Actions turned on.

[16:17:18.0623] <ljharb>
If you‚Äôre an admin on those repos you can do it yourself; if not, then that‚Äôs the ask id make of the chairs :-)

[16:18:01.0634] <jschoi>
Yes, I would like to be made admin of those repositories by a chair. I‚Äôve pinged before but they‚Äôre busy, and it‚Äôs not urgent anyway. üòÑ

[16:22:39.0298] <ljharb>
unfortunately when you transfer your own repo to an org, you lose admin rights on it by default; i usually try to restore those rights while it's in tc39-transfer but sometimes the chairs transfer the repos before i get to it

Alright. Please do finish soon!

Someone has created a website that scrapes the tc39/proposals repo and then provides a UI to see various summaries/indexes.

https://www.proposals.es/

It somewhat duplicates the official website, but has extra data, e.g. proposals are sorted by star count. 

[11:14:52.0104] <Hemanth H.M>
There was https://github.com/bevacqua/prop-tc39 which was active for few years, also there is https://jsfeatures.in [shameless plug] we should request the author of proposals.es to contribute to the official site rather?

[11:18:53.0389] <bakkot>
official site definitely should not include star counts

[11:18:55.0773] <bakkot>
star counts are poison

[12:14:37.0335] <shu>
should include randomized star counts on every load

[12:14:39.0687] <shu>
keep'em guessing

[12:15:36.0584] <shu>
also include some other kind of emoji counts, like ü•¶ or ü™Å

[12:19:49.0640] <Rob Palmer>
Putting aside the broccoli for a moment, I think there was a related plenary discussion on maintaining authoritative structured data to enable more folk to create live websites for viewing proposal summaries.

https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/master/meetings/2020-11/nov-19.md#dealing-with-tc39-data

[12:23:43.0796] <Rob Palmer>
We can ask Yulia the status of this, but I read it as general agreement with the principle, modulo Leo's test262 experience with trying this previously.  My guess is that, like many things in TC39, we just need some energetic volunteer willing to lead an initiative to make it happen.

[12:24:03.0211] <shu>
oh Rob Palmer while you're here, do you have access to finish the transfer for https://github.com/tc39-transfer/proposal-structs?

[12:25:46.0494] <Rob Palmer>
that is now transferred, Shu

[12:27:55.0883] <shu>
much appreciated, thank you

jschoi: how do you do your corpus analyses? i'm interested in gauging the popularity of some Array methods

[07:46:50.0227] <jschoi>
shu: Take a look at the ‚ÄúWhat methodology was used‚Äù disclosure element at the end of this section: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bind-this#bind-and-call-are-very-common.

[07:47:40.0562] <shu>
ah you did mention Gzmenid

[07:47:42.0385] <shu>
neat, thank you!

[07:47:55.0416] <jschoi>
Basically, download Gzemnid‚Äôs slim.code.js.txt.lz4 and search.topcode.sh.
Then run:
```bash
./search.topcode.sh '\.bind\b' | awk 'END { print NR }‚Äô
```
‚Ä¶or whatever.

[08:52:25.0017] <Ashley Claymore>
Not as impressive as what jschoi has done but we also did a bit of corpus research for change-array-by-copy: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-change-array-by-copy/issues/37

[08:53:35.0018] <Ashley Claymore>
regex matching, so .slice could be string or array

[11:35:41.0988] <Richard Gibson>
why is `WeakRef.prototype.constructor` normative optional? https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-weak-ref.prototype.constructor

[11:36:14.0396] <shu>
SES IIRC?

[11:43:19.0397] <Richard Gibson>
how so? I could see WeakRef itself being normative optional, but what is the point of shipping a WeakRef whose prototype does not have a `constructor` property?

[11:45:12.0978] <Richard Gibson>
and I don't see discussion at https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2089 other than "we're adding inline normative optional spec text" from yulia in the PR description without further explanation

[11:49:30.0455] <Mathieu Hofman>
The motivation is that it can be removed so you wouldn't be able to create a new WeakRef from an instance. Aka sharing an instance to observe the liveness of one object doesn't allow you start observing the liveness of any object.

[11:51:27.0778] <Richard Gibson>
but why would an implementation ship that rather than requiring code to delete the property?

[11:52:51.0713] <Richard Gibson>
it seems bizarrely special-cased from an implementation perspective

[11:53:21.0107] <ljharb>
same reason an implementation would "ship" without any other normative-optional thing

[11:53:26.0402] <Mathieu Hofman>
The idea is that an environment without access to the contructor through the prototype would still be a compliant JavaScript environment. Aka not introduce code that expects it to be there.

[11:53:40.0139] <ljharb>
code that requires normative-optional things to exist isn't portable; it's reasonable for an implementation to only support portable code (where "implementation" could include "any environment that's been prepared with first-run JS code")

[11:54:01.0592] <ljharb>
 * code that requires normative-optional things to exist isn't portable; it's reasonable for an implementation to only support portable code (where "implementation" could include "any environment that's been prepared with first-run JS code")

[11:54:30.0032] <Mathieu Hofman>
Richard Gibson  Is there any reason you would want it to always be there?

[11:54:55.0724] <Mathieu Hofman>
besides the "it's different

[11:55:28.0028] <Richard Gibson>
to avoid the cognitive burden of an exception to the rule that every built-in constructor's prototype has a `constructor` property referencing it

[11:56:52.0288] <Richard Gibson>
`delete builtInConstructor.prototype.constructor` is always allowed, but only in this one case is a conforming implementation allowed to ship without the property present at all

[11:58:37.0884] <Mathieu Hofman>
Do you have a specific use case, or is it conceptual only ?

[11:58:51.0417] <Richard Gibson>
the latter

[11:59:51.0331] <Richard Gibson>
it's not even like it allows SES or similar to avoid the `delete WeakRef.prototype.constructor` code, because conforming implementations can and do ship with it
