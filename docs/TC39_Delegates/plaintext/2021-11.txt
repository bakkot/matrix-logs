Could someone with permissions to tc39-transfer finish the transfer process for the proposals that advanced to Stage 1 last meeting?

[13:03:36.0121] <ljharb>
(that'd be the chairs)

[15:30:52.0344] <shu>
Aki: bterlson: Rob Palmer: ^ (would also appreciate finalizing transfer of structs, which i forgot to transfer to tc39-transfers after last meeting)

[15:44:48.0796] <jschoi>
Also when possible, I would like a chair to turn on GitHub Actions in proposals-bigint-math and proposals-array-fromasync and switch their repository homepages to their spec pages on tc39.github.com.

github actions should be automatically on for everything, is it not?

[11:40:20.0464] <bakkot>
shu: what's `Atomics.waitAsync` waiting on? just a second implementation? 

[11:40:55.0600] <shu>
correct

[11:41:13.0789] <shu>
it is actually pretty tricky to implement, and the use case is fairly niche, so probably not prioritized

[11:41:23.0079] <shu>
you have a use case?

[11:45:55.0297] <bakkot>
not really

[11:46:02.0472] <bakkot>
I was just going to publish a pure-JS `setTimeout` polyfill

[11:48:38.0474] <shu>
ah

What was the deadline for October-plenary notes edits, again? I was planning to edit them over the weekend.

[11:55:35.0313] <bakkot>
jschoi: "They will be published on November 11th" per the reflector

[11:55:50.0143] <bakkot>
though I imagine you could ask to hold off a couple of days to get your edits in

I'm happy to delay publishing until Monday.

GitHub Actions are not active for https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint-math/. (I was wrong about proposal-array-from-async, though. Actions are active on that one‚Äîalthough, for some reason, https://tc39.github.io/proposal-array-from-async/ doesn‚Äôt work.)

[16:14:26.0880] <bakkot>
jschoi: presumably you don't have github pages on, which is a distinct thing from having github actions on

[16:16:13.0555] <jschoi>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> jschoi: presumably you don't have github pages on, which is a distinct thing from having github actions on

Ah yeah, that‚Äôs right. That‚Äôs under repository settings, right? 

So I have two TC39 repositories in which the GitHub Pages option needs to be turned on, as well as editing the repository home page. One repository also needs to have Actions turned on.

[16:17:18.0623] <ljharb>
If you‚Äôre an admin on those repos you can do it yourself; if not, then that‚Äôs the ask id make of the chairs :-)

[16:18:01.0634] <jschoi>
Yes, I would like to be made admin of those repositories by a chair. I‚Äôve pinged before but they‚Äôre busy, and it‚Äôs not urgent anyway. üòÑ

[16:22:39.0298] <ljharb>
unfortunately when you transfer your own repo to an org, you lose admin rights on it by default; i usually try to restore those rights while it's in tc39-transfer but sometimes the chairs transfer the repos before i get to it

Alright. Please do finish soon!

Someone has created a website that scrapes the tc39/proposals repo and then provides a UI to see various summaries/indexes.

https://www.proposals.es/

It somewhat duplicates the official website, but has extra data, e.g. proposals are sorted by star count. 

[11:14:52.0104] <Hemanth H.M>
There was https://github.com/bevacqua/prop-tc39 which was active for few years, also there is https://jsfeatures.in [shameless plug] we should request the author of proposals.es to contribute to the official site rather?

[11:18:53.0389] <bakkot>
official site definitely should not include star counts

[11:18:55.0773] <bakkot>
star counts are poison

[12:14:37.0335] <shu>
should include randomized star counts on every load

[12:14:39.0687] <shu>
keep'em guessing

[12:15:36.0584] <shu>
also include some other kind of emoji counts, like ü•¶ or ü™Å

[12:19:49.0640] <Rob Palmer>
Putting aside the broccoli for a moment, I think there was a related plenary discussion on maintaining authoritative structured data to enable more folk to create live websites for viewing proposal summaries.

https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/master/meetings/2020-11/nov-19.md#dealing-with-tc39-data

[12:23:43.0796] <Rob Palmer>
We can ask Yulia the status of this, but I read it as general agreement with the principle, modulo Leo's test262 experience with trying this previously.  My guess is that, like many things in TC39, we just need some energetic volunteer willing to lead an initiative to make it happen.

[12:24:03.0211] <shu>
oh Rob Palmer while you're here, do you have access to finish the transfer for https://github.com/tc39-transfer/proposal-structs?

[12:25:46.0494] <Rob Palmer>
that is now transferred, Shu

[12:27:55.0883] <shu>
much appreciated, thank you
