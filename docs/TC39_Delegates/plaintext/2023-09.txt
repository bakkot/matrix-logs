@shu We do a thing in SES that Mark calls ‚Äúenablements‚Äù to compensate for the override mistake which may be of interest: We replace the non-writable property with a getter/setter pair. The prototype is still effectively frozen, but assignment-override works. We‚Äôd be delighted to be in touch.

[09:47:45.0295] <Michael Ficarra>
Kris Kowal: Yes, we considered taking this approach for `Iterator.prototype[Symbol.toStringTag]` because of this exact issue with regenerator-runtime (see https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/pull/213), but instead decided to just make the property writable

[09:51:04.0788] <ljharb>
this is interesting: https://twitter.com/webreflection/status/1697518069554299121 - isn't there some security thing around SAB that this seems to bypass via wasm?

[09:54:19.0787] <shu>
that's always been the case (since COOP/COEP shipped)

[09:54:28.0257] <shu>
it's explicitly allowed, and wpt uses it in testing

[09:54:52.0234] <shu>
the actual capability is the sharing of memory, not the SAB constructor. without COI you still can't postMessage the buffer across workers

[09:54:54.0258] <bakkot>
the problem isn't getting a SAB, it's being able to share it to workers

[09:55:05.0686] <bakkot>
see step 13.1.1 of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#structuredserializeinternal

[09:55:59.0074] <shu>
this is my "fault" technically: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4732#issuecomment-598470434

[09:56:13.0482] <shu>
but we did it for compat reasons for chrome users

I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd recommend ‚Äúenablements‚Äù as a general language compensation for override-mistake, but we do recommend replacing certain properties with accessors as a preparation for freezing a prototype in environments that freeze shared prototypes.

[09:59:02.0493] <shu>
the original plan, was, in fact, to make SAB always available

[10:15:48.0853] <ljharb>
ah ok, thanks, that makes sense

[10:50:53.0335] <leobalter>
Stage 3 won't become a silver bullet for proposal changes.

[11:44:00.0713] <Michael Ficarra>
of course, changes can be made in response to implementation feedback

[11:45:14.0401] <Michael Ficarra>
the point of this change is to catch necessary changes before we get to the point of implementation so we don't waste implementers' time, not to have an indicator of rock-solid stability

[14:28:11.0958] <littledan>
Huh, facilitating feature detection seems like a good thing‚Ä¶

[14:28:31.0144] <littledan>
(I saw parts of this controversy but never really followed along closely enough)

[14:30:07.0245] <littledan>
I agree with Leo. Actually, HTML integration is already a requirement in practice, just randomly enforced by certain delegates (including me), and it has been this way for years 

[14:30:14.0064] <littledan>
We should document this

[14:30:32.0088] <littledan>

[14:30:45.0382] <littledan>
It feels funny to have html be special but it just is

[14:30:58.0332] <littledan>
I think that is why we have hesitated to document it so far

[14:33:26.0642] <Michael Ficarra>
littledan: I agree but I don't think it needs to be combined with my proposed process change

[14:34:00.0040] <Michael Ficarra>
as we saw at the last meeting, it is already hard for some delegates to understand the process change

[14:34:04.0304] <littledan>
> <@michaelficarra:matrix.org> littledan: I agree but I don't think it needs to be combined with my proposed process change

Sure they are separate, maybe good for Leo to put this other point on the agenda for this meeting 

[14:34:47.0342] <littledan>
As far as I am concerned, HTML integration is already a requirement, just a poorly documented one, unlike your proposal which is a genuine change in how we work

[14:49:00.0318] <shu>
process or no process my personal resolve going forward is i will block stage 3 on proposals where there's non-trivial amounts of semantics in the integration

[14:49:16.0542] <shu>
 * process or no process my personal resolve going forward is i will block stage 3 on proposals where there's non-trivial amounts of semantics in the integration, and the integration is not yet done

[16:03:50.0015] <shu>
eh, i guess arguably the right way to feature detect is `self.crossOriginIsolated`, not the existence of the SAB constructor

it's actually a reference to the original title of War and Peace

yes this gives me concern

Is Daniel Minor (Mozilla) in this channel?

I've seen the agenda item proposing demotion of ShadowRealms to Stage 2. I'd love if we can link that agenda item to an open (new?) thread in the ShadowRealms repo.

Considering the facts, I'd have to agree with the arguments and recognize there's an amount of work for HTML integration I initially underestimated.

Saying that, we have work with Igalia restarting on this in October 1st. This update is as fresh as today. The budget cut happened initially along the mass layoffs and we are putting it back to order to continue the work here.

Even if the demotion is unavoidable, I'd love we can set a plan for the next steps for what would be expected for re-requesting Stage 3.

Having a thread linked to this agenda item, we can have pre-discussions and champions might be able to draw some estimates as well.

dminor is here.

[14:20:55.0775] <leobalter>
Thank you, Kris Kowal ! I couldn't find it. 

For the ref: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WJd9g3df_ibVHK3LdoKX2FboDwYQBUBJNxuRAWOYYbM/edit#slide=id.p

[14:24:49.0446] <shu>
i agree with dminor's points

[14:25:13.0337] <shu>
i think a demotion to stage 2 would be precisely to make the criteria for getting back to stage 3 clear

[14:25:28.0082] <shu>
(which is html integration)

[14:25:54.0942] <shu>
so any update Igalia or the champions want to provide on restarting that work would be towards the same goal IMO

[14:26:19.0019] <shu>
but the current state, as the slides say, is not implementable nor shippable

[14:26:38.0222] <shu>
also, recall Apple even had to unship because of a misunderstanding of what the HTML integration involved!

[14:28:32.0691] <leobalter>
I fully understand from this perspective. 

I just wish we had Michael Ficarra's mid-stage.

While we don't have the new stage, hopefully we can agree to settle the current ES-specs as a like-stage-3 quality/stable. Of course this would still be subject to new changes for anything new identified in the HTML integration. Is that agreedable?

[14:29:36.0676] <shu>
yes, i think it'd be good to reaffirm consensus that the 262 spec is fine as-is

[14:29:41.0113] <ljharb>
we've done that twice now, with import assertions and something else

[14:29:50.0753] <shu>
and that there are no further plans to redesign

[14:30:06.0581] <ljharb>
demotion to stage 2, with a consensus about what items are expected to make it re-eligible for stage 3 consensus (implying that other items aren't in scope)
