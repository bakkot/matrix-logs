@shu We do a thing in SES that Mark calls “enablements” to compensate for the override mistake which may be of interest: We replace the non-writable property with a getter/setter pair. The prototype is still effectively frozen, but assignment-override works. We’d be delighted to be in touch.

Kris Kowal: Yes, we considered taking this approach for `Iterator.prototype[Symbol.toStringTag]` because of this exact issue with regenerator-runtime (see https://github.com/tc39/proposal-iterator-helpers/pull/213), but instead decided to just make the property writable

this is interesting: https://twitter.com/webreflection/status/1697518069554299121 - isn't there some security thing around SAB that this seems to bypass via wasm?

[09:54:19.0787] <shu>
that's always been the case (since COOP/COEP shipped)

[09:54:28.0257] <shu>
it's explicitly allowed, and wpt uses it in testing

[09:54:52.0234] <shu>
the actual capability is the sharing of memory, not the SAB constructor. without COI you still can't postMessage the buffer across workers

[09:54:54.0258] <bakkot>
the problem isn't getting a SAB, it's being able to share it to workers

[09:55:05.0686] <bakkot>
see step 13.1.1 of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#structuredserializeinternal

[09:55:59.0074] <shu>
this is my "fault" technically: https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/4732#issuecomment-598470434

[09:56:13.0482] <shu>
but we did it for compat reasons for chrome users

I don’t think we’d recommend “enablements” as a general language compensation for override-mistake, but we do recommend replacing certain properties with accessors as a preparation for freezing a prototype in environments that freeze shared prototypes.

[09:59:02.0493] <shu>
the original plan, was, in fact, to make SAB always available
