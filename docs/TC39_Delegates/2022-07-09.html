<p>Yes, in Rust the compiler will prevent you from making this particular mistake, whereas in JS you are more likely to get bit by it, so yes, there's a significant downside to using iterators that Rust does not have (though all the other languages I named do - nothing prevents you from trying to re-use a Java stream, e.g.).</p>
<p>But the most important question is whether the helpers are usable and clear when used <em>correctly</em>, and on that question, the compiler checks are irrelevant.</p>
<p>(And there's similar problems with accidentally re-using helpers on <em>iterables</em> in other non-rust languages, for that matter - see e.g. the second half of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/28513908">https://stackoverflow.com/a/28513908</a>, which discusses the downsides of C#'s IEnumerable design which were explicitly considered when designing Java's Streams. We're all jealous of Rust's compile-time checks but we still have to design a language which works without them.)</p>
