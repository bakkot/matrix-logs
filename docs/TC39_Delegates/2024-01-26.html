I appreciate the amount of work that has gone into the presentation and the proposals, but advancement to Stage 1 is about agreement that the problem is worth investigating, and a 90 minute timebox to me sounds like we're getting into too many details about how to solve the problem. I would prefer a shorter Stage 1 advancement presentation, followed by a Stage 1 update at the next plenary. I think that splitting this way could help keep the discussion more focused, by separating the "should this be part of JavaScript" from "how should we do this" into separate discussions.</td></tr>

I expect much of that timebox will be in discussion about hoisting, as that's where we last left it. The actual presentation isn't 90 minutes long. I'm also happy to couch a discussion about hoisting as something to dig into as part of stage 1, as you said, but a discussion on hoisting needs to happen at some point whether that is now or in two months.</td></tr>

It's a known concern from prior discussions dating back 8-9 years from when Yehuda was the initial decorators champion. It may take multiple sessions to iron out, so I'd like to get the ball rolling as other proposals like parameter decorators (which is already stage 1) have a dependency on this.</td></tr>

(And it isn’t a good idea to work around that ceiling by breaking things into multiple agenda items, for the same reason). At the same time, I do think it would be good to introduce the hoisting topic as well as Ron’s preferred conclusion—I think that part should be able to fit in under 15 minutes (just to state the problem and have a brief discussion, to make sure everyone understands; drawing a conclusion would happen in a future meeting)</td></tr>

We've already had a number of discussions about this in plenary since Decorators was first proposed, with no clear outcome. This isn't exactly a net new topic, though there may be new voices joining the dialogue. My hope is that the numerous prior discussions we've already had are a good indicator that this proposal should at least get stage 1 to continue examining the problem, but in a more focused way.</td></tr>
