I appreciate the amount of work that has gone into the presentation and the proposals, but advancement to Stage 1 is about agreement that the problem is worth investigating, and a 90 minute timebox to me sounds like we're getting into too many details about how to solve the problem. I would prefer a shorter Stage 1 advancement presentation, followed by a Stage 1 update at the next plenary. I think that splitting this way could help keep the discussion more focused, by separating the "should this be part of JavaScript" from "how should we do this" into separate discussions.</td></tr>

I expect much of that timebox will be in discussion about hoisting, as that's where we last left it. The actual presentation isn't 90 minutes long. I'm also happy to couch a discussion about hoisting as something to dig into as part of stage 1, as you said, but a discussion on hoisting needs to happen at some point whether that is now or in two months.</td></tr>
