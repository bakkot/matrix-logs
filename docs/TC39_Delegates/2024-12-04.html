<p><em>For clarity and for the records, I no longer speak as a champion of the proposal, but as a regular delegate.</em></p>
<p>It seems the only real blocker for Stage advancement is getting agreement from DOM vendors, which I agree. I don't think - and I hope I'm right - that stage 2.7 or stage 3 would change how DOM vendors would react or accept the proposal.</p>
<p>The challenge for DOM vendors to accept is having the design (resolved), tests (resolved), and <strong>capacity for implementation</strong>.</p>
<p>I don't think DOM vendors would be able to prioritize or willing to implement it just for the sake of releasing a new feature. I believe this one is up to the champions finding sponsorship for the implementation. That's something I no longer control or can exercise much leverage.</p>
<p>Given all the facts and where we are at with ShadowRealm, offering funding for implementation of ShadowRealm is the best chance to get it accepted, and then yes, move it up to stages 3 and 4. This may still require vendors spending some cycles on review, but I think it's doable.</p>

<p>but something i wanted to just throw out there regarding error stacks</p>
<p>rather than trying to standardize (or at least codify) what already exists, what if we created a new <code>Error.prototype.get standardizedStack</code> or something which we can build entirely from scratch (i.e. a uniform format across engines)?</p>
<p>to be clear this wouldn't preclude engines from having their own <code>stack</code> that contains whatever details the engine wants to provide</p>
<p>instead it would give an opportunity for all of us to agree on at least some minimal meaning for "what does a stack look like?" and "how do i get one?"</p></td></tr>
