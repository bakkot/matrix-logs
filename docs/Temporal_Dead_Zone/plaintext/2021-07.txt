though it looks like they broke their cert; you'll need to manually trim off the 'www' after the redirect

[18:37:54.0858] <bakkot>
I'll fix my redirect

[18:59:50.0765] <Aki>
Thank you

[19:00:28.0541] <Aki>
Also ‚Äúfootgun‚Äù is missing from the possible values. (Footgun is why I was looking it up)

[19:02:13.0002] <Aki>
I wrote a bingo card generator, maybe it‚Äôs time to bring it back. 

[21:01:34.0473] <DerekNonGeneric>
you know, the term we use in academia is "pitfall" as opposed to "footgun"

[21:03:35.0906] <DerekNonGeneric>
or maybe they're not the same, but that is another word for you

[23:46:32.0914] <ryzokuken>
but do people say "pitfall" in plenary? I've heard footgun a lot but never pitfall (or I did but do not remember).

[23:47:16.0978] <ryzokuken>
also I just got "refactoring hazard", this bingo is really well done üòõ 

[06:59:44.0065] <devsnek>

2021-07-08
[14:09:40.0739] <rkirsling>
in the other direction, there are a few terms that haven't been used while I've been around

[14:10:07.0785] <rkirsling>
like "nannyish" or "scenario-solving" (not even sure what the latter _is_)

[14:11:05.0453] <rkirsling>
"cow path" could be another to add

[14:11:27.0932] <rkirsling>
or just "membrane"

[14:11:55.0315] <rkirsling>
somehow membranes always get mentioned

[16:00:35.0614] <shu>
scenario solving is like solving specific problems instead of getting the right abstraction that solves a broader set of problems i think

[16:45:42.0855] <rkirsling>
ahh okay

[16:45:50.0787] <rkirsling>
so like "lack of independent motivation"

[16:47:08.0276] <rkirsling>
I feel like for "nannyish" I'd more expect to hear "hand-holding"? but not sure whether that counts as an overused term for us


2021-07-10
[10:01:26.0436] <ljharb>
yeah I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúbeing paternalistic‚Äù more often than ‚Äúnannyish‚Äù but i doubt either term is ideal 


2021-07-11
[20:14:44.0268] <shu>
i usually say "coddling" i think

[22:08:01.0463] <littledan>
These terms reek of gender! Not sure if that matters, but we're in tdz so

[22:08:48.0228] <littledan>
Aren't these various words describing raising children good things?

[22:12:23.0391] <littledan>
What metaphors about other topics could work? "Gilded cage" "forces you down a narrow path", "prescriptivist", etc

[06:45:19.0115] <devsnek>
"helicopter committee"

[06:59:22.0512] <ljharb>
‚Äútreating developers as if they‚Äôre children and as if we know what‚Äôs best for them‚Äù indeed seems like the theme

[08:50:03.0553] <devsnek>
top level await has really changed a lot since I added it to engine262

[08:50:48.0686] <devsnek>

I'm not showing this at the Realms presentation, but it's worth sharing here: 

[09:56:45.0801] <leobalter>
https://twitter.com/leobalter/status/1414232479934734340?s=21

[15:21:43.0576] <devsnek>
with all this extra time we could spend the entirety of day 4 discussing  asi

[15:32:39.0223] <littledan>
yeah, and we can spend day 3 on Annex B

[16:54:05.0545] <leobalter>
How about a new pragma? Something that enables `with` in strict mode 

[16:54:40.0823] <leobalter>
jokes apart, I believe there is a chance for time overflow for the Realms discussion. I'd prefer to resolve it in the timebox, but this is TC39

[16:56:18.0763] <littledan>
let's do super-strict mode, but make sure it's not *too* strict to be an adoption barrier. But, it'll get rid of all of the bad parts of JS.

[16:56:40.0514] <littledan>
this discussion can be on day 5


2021-07-13
[17:11:30.0617] <bakkot>
leobalter: I actually have a babel transform which enables `with` in strict mode as long as you don't also need direct `eval`

[17:13:13.0328] <littledan>
but do you have an eslint plugin to implement super-strict mode?

[17:14:07.0327] <leobalter>
bakkot: so you mean I can't have the best of both worlds?

[17:14:44.0240] <bakkot>
just need to write an babl plugin which rewrites direct eval into indirect eval

[17:14:44.0856] <devsnek>
> <@bakkot:matrix.org> leobalter: I actually have a babel transform which enables `with` in strict mode as long as you don't also need direct `eval`

send pls

[17:14:46.0421] <bakkot>
it's technically doable

[17:14:56.0392] <bakkot>
devsnek: wrote it on company time, unfortunately

[17:15:07.0382] <devsnek>
send it to me on company time

[17:15:46.0040] <bakkot>
but it's the obvious thing: within a `with (o)`, rewrite every variable reference to `'x' in o ? o.x : x`

[17:16:08.0552] <devsnek>
nice

[18:13:06.0382] <leobalter>
We can stream this video to fill in all the time we don't use for this meeting

[18:14:37.0630] <Aki>

[18:45:44.0612] <bakkot>
I appreciate that the quality of the weather in the place ECMA is having a GA meeting is a topic of importance to Istvan but I really really do not care about it

[18:46:33.0503] <shu>
i'd rather we end early yes

[18:47:17.0195] <littledan>
yeah, I thought we were going to move towards written updates from Istvan

[18:48:04.0228] <littledan>
maybe we can propose that again to him?

I don't understand what was the proposal but I don't want to ask what was it

[19:30:33.0035] <bakkot>
Linux foundation wants to partner with Ecma and also wants Ecma to change their bylaws in some herein unspecified fashion

that is 100% of the content of this presentation so far

[19:32:05.0954] <leobalter>

[07:28:03.0893] <devsnek>
the grammar for class elements is nuts

[07:28:10.0734] <devsnek>
so much overlap between these productions

[07:31:28.0428] <devsnek>
and apparently `static` is a valid field name

[07:42:57.0133] <littledan>
I dunno, it's unambiguous and has several correct implementations that pass the conformance tests

[07:43:52.0556] <littledan>
We tried to follow the pattern from object literals and class methods that basically all names are allowed, even if they are keywords

[07:44:19.0914] <littledan>
IMO arrow functions and destructing are a lot weirder to parse than classes

[08:09:58.0055] <devsnek>
yea i know it can be implemented, it's just quite scary lol


2021-07-14
[18:05:23.0232] <devsnek>
i think i've gotten like 50% through implementing class fields now

[18:05:29.0766] <devsnek>
some tests are passing 

[18:25:44.0329] <devsnek>
i think we should reserve e4x

[18:28:44.0602] <shu>
this is how we start versioning JS

[18:29:39.0436] <shu>

[18:33:04.0572] <shu>
if it's JScript MSFT lawyers might like a word!

[18:34:36.0347] <devsnek>

javecmascript

[18:35:58.0389] <devsnek>
jambascript

[18:36:13.0293] <ljharb>
instead of `import`, the keyword is `blend`

[18:36:27.0473] <bterlson>

is that still around

[18:36:42.0774] <devsnek>
"wscript" what

[18:36:49.0659] <devsnek>
is that like a wide jscript

It does, with a flag on (but only with classes constructor)

[18:48:35.0791] <leobalter>
reminder that `/*/` is a syntax error

[18:48:38.0097] <devsnek>

apparently they already do

[18:48:54.0566] <bakkot>
type annotations should not have runtime effects

[18:51:14.0220] <Jack Works>
Not quite useful cause complex type is not representable

[18:51:47.0311] <devsnek>
just need a typing library

[18:51:50.0448] <devsnek>
like python

[18:52:27.0219] <Jamie Kyle>
devsnek: you mean like https://github.com/colinhacks/zod

[18:52:54.0176] <devsnek>
maybe?

[18:53:05.0504] <devsnek>
i'm not talking about schemas

[18:53:12.0214] <devsnek>
but if zod lets you describe complex types then sure

[18:53:50.0359] <Jack Works>
it doesn't preserve generics, union/conjunction types, mapped types, etc

[18:54:33.0650] <Jamie Kyle>
`z.intersection(z.object({ prop: z.string() }), z.object({ prop2: z.number() }))` it can do quite a bit

[18:54:34.0116] <Jack Works>
class info can be preserved though, I guess it's a OOP win

[18:55:20.0192] <Jack Works>
* Only x: ClassA, not x: ClassA | ClassB

You'd need a custom calendar too, because there's not a 1:1 mapping between Earth month/day/year and whatever calendar NASA, ESA, and the little green men use. 

[20:17:02.0501] <ryzokuken>
it was just a lot of churn for a use-case that's not very well-defined yet, this one needs more time and research

Planetary cultural appropriation!  Soon there'd be Earth teenagers trying to live on Mars time because they saw it on TikTok.

[20:19:30.0636] <ptomato>
> <@gibson042:matrix.org> devsnek: `Temporal.Duration.from("P1D").round({largestUnit:"hour"}).hours`

that will also need a `relativeTo` since it deals with calendar units

[20:20:08.0777] <ryzokuken>
> <@devsnek:matrix.org> what is `P1D`

a duration of 1 day

[20:20:09.0550] <iain>
NASA teams working on Mars rovers typically switch to Mars time and shift ~40 minutes with respect to every Earth day 

[20:20:24.0132] <Richard Gibson>

[21:21:40.0003] <Richard Gibson>

It could be on the other edge too, maybe it'll go the an "older" state üòõ

wow, I think that was the first slur I've seen come out of the notes bot

[21:51:26.0416] <Michael Ficarra>
and that is why we revise the notes :-)

[22:11:31.0228] <leobalter>
these birds are total pricks

[22:20:18.0217] <Aki>
my family literally refers to the as "the fuck you birds"

[22:31:19.0414] <leobalter>
Aki: second that. That's pretty much how my spouse express about these birds

[22:32:49.0840] <leobalter>
I remember in Boston we got some 5AM-ish hundreds of birds outside and then her yelling: "F*** YOU! I HATE BIRDS!". 

[22:33:35.0910] <Aki>
just in the past two weeks or so my local birds have started chirping at midnight and i haaaaate them

[22:38:22.0064] <leobalter>
bakkot: that function example is one of the worst precedents 

[22:39:21.0453] <bakkot>
I kinda like hoisting honestly!

[22:39:30.0181] <bakkot>
but yeah it's weird

[22:39:49.0354] <devsnek>
i would trade hoisting for decorators

[22:42:53.0899] <ljharb>
like you want decorators and not hoisting?

[22:43:21.0134] <leobalter>
bakkot: I just wrote some horrible hoisting example today: https://gist.github.com/leobalter/274ba70e6b5fd5ba79550a7c93e54cf5#file-js-L5-L18

[22:43:40.0552] <devsnek>
> <@ljharb:matrix.org> like you want decorators and not hoisting?

ye

[22:44:08.0032] <ljharb>
sounds like a double win to me

[22:44:21.0072] <devsnek>
people who think the filter acts on the liquid are not allowed here any more

[22:45:56.0855] <bakkot>
leobalter: that's B.3.3, not just hoisting

[22:46:26.0002] <bakkot>
I just pretend B.3.3 doesn't exist

[22:46:28.0181] <bakkot>
strict mode all the way

[22:46:29.0832] <leobalter>
well, one does not have JS without Annex B

[22:47:07.0653] <devsnek>
bakkot are you excited to move b.3.3 into the main body of the spec

[22:47:27.0681] <bakkot>
I am not going to let that happen until we figure out exactly how to write it down correctly, which we still haven't done yet

[22:47:31.0517] <bakkot>
but then honestly yes

[22:47:36.0594] <bakkot>
because the current specification is extremely unclear

[22:47:40.0026] <bakkot>
because of being in annex B

[22:48:28.0488] <devsnek>
javascript is functional right?

[22:48:44.0574] <bakkot>
no in both senses :P

[22:48:48.0765] <bakkot>
 * no in both senses :P

[22:48:50.0866] <devsnek>

i have definitely crafted multiple kinds of `true` to evolve a boolean API option in the past

[18:10:39.0260] <bterlson>
three types of true? Pfff ithkuil has 10 types of true.

[18:11:35.0264] <ljharb>
this one has parseInt(10, 3) types of true :-p

[18:15:32.0502] <bterlson>
The relevant section of Ithkuil, for those curious: http://www.ithkuil.net/05_verbs_1.html#Sec5o9

[18:56:17.0894] <leobalter>
we have both meeting spacing and lack of topics for incubator calls. I have a raw idea for a proposal but it's early to show it even as stage 0. I'm open to chat about it if anyone is curious, but not worth using the plenary for this

[18:56:28.0356] <leobalter>
it's about proxies 

[19:00:33.0976] <devsnek>
:O

[19:00:46.0015] <ljharb>
i can't decide if i want to ask or not

[19:00:55.0600] <devsnek>
proxies 2

[19:04:17.0070] <leobalter>
I need to check the temperature before I bring it as stage 0, but I've been setting strategies for transparent proxies. 

[19:05:10.0407] <ljharb>
i think it'd be pretty straightforward to allow them to forward private fields, if they were reified as symbols :-/

[19:07:45.0405] <devsnek>

[19:31:42.0215] <iain>

[19:31:45.0874] <iain>
Keep programmers on their toes

[19:32:05.0819] <ryzokuken>
haha perfect, let's put this in the spec

[19:32:30.0760] <ryzokuken>
`const now = Temporal.now || Temporal.Now`

[19:32:38.0673] <ryzokuken>
my polyfill business is booming

[19:36:31.0560] <leobalter>
Wikipedia only lists the capitalized Now

[19:36:54.0611] <devsnek>
now?

[19:37:11.0647] <ryzokuken>
`Temporal.NOW`

[19:37:23.0520] <ryzokuken>
all problems solved

[19:37:32.0199] <ryzokuken>
it's neither a function nor a constructor

[19:37:38.0542] <devsnek>
its too loud

[19:38:27.0751] <leobalter>
News headline: _Now or now? TC39 takes a very optimistic turn and won't discuss if it's now or never!_ 

[19:38:41.0564] <ryzokuken>
`Temporal.ŒΩŒøœé`?

[19:39:15.0947] <leobalter>
`Temporal.never; // -Infinity`

[19:40:23.0269] <leobalter>
as -Infinity would be the best numeric representation of something never happened, it's set to never before the start of time

[19:40:46.0182] <leobalter>
`Temporal.always; // Infinity`

[19:41:06.0409] <leobalter>
or should I capitalize those?

[19:41:32.0845] <ryzokuken>
it is a constant

[19:41:37.0388] <ryzokuken>
`Temporal.NEVER`

[19:44:37.0826] <leobalter>
makes sense

[19:45:04.0989] <devsnek>
intentional with a t?

[19:45:47.0958] <leobalter>
you can still make it a namespace: `Temporal.Never.instant(); // NaN`

[19:46:41.0620] <leobalter>
`Temporal.Later.instant()` returns a range 

[19:49:23.0018] <shu>
devsnek: i was distinguishing intensional vs intentional

[19:49:42.0307] <devsnek>
i see

[19:49:54.0737] <devsnek>
learning new words

[19:50:24.0195] <ljharb>
what is "intensional"? i don't know that one

[19:50:40.0289] <shu>
it's a logic and philosophy of language concept, don't think it gets much use outside of that

[19:50:47.0707] <devsnek>
> In linguistics, logic, philosophy, and other fields, an intension is any property or quality connoted by a word, phrase, or another symbol. In the case of a word, the word's definition often implies an intension.

[19:50:49.0989] <devsnek>
whatever that means

[19:51:02.0101] <shu>
an "intensional definition" is what you usually think of as a definition

[19:51:13.0712] <shu>
the necessary and sufficient conditions that would make X, X

[19:51:30.0087] <iain>
The wiki page is reasonably helpful: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_and_intensional_definitions

[19:51:39.0262] <shu>
that's contrasted with "extensional", which is like, a list of all instances of X

[21:56:32.0779] <bakkot>

let me say only that that is not code that I would write personally

[21:57:06.0370] <Michael Ficarra>
the problem with ring 0 anti-cheat is that rings are signed :-)

[21:57:25.0833] <devsnek>
the problem with ring 0 anti-cheat is that it assumes i'm not running custom microcode

the fallacy that the creator decides the ultimate pronunciation of their creation is the silliest part hehe

[23:24:42.0532] <ljharb>
psh, no it's not

[23:24:59.0096] <ljharb>
who else should get to decide

[23:35:38.0638] <rkirsling>
the populace; I always give the example of how the creator of Hadoop meant for it to be pronounced HAD-oop instead of ha-DOOP, which is like, sorry buddy, that's not an accent pattern that occurs in English

[23:36:53.0922] <ljharb>
that still makes the former correct, even if literally nobody will ever pronounce it that way

[23:37:05.0806] <ljharb>
the populace doesn't get to decide that your dog's name is suddenly pronounced differently.

[23:37:23.0993] <ljharb>
kamala harris' name has a correct pronounciation even if almost every reporter gets it wrong :-) (altho that's a sentient being so it's ofc a different category)

[23:37:33.0434] <ljharb>
 * kamala harris' name has a correct pronounciation even if almost every reporter gets it wrong :-) (altho that's a sentient being so it's ofc a different category)

[23:37:34.0579] <rkirsling>
maybe? but then correctness isn't the thing in question, I guess

[23:37:50.0185] <ljharb>
not on that tweet thread, sure

[23:37:59.0946] <rkirsling>
(for a tech thing, not for a person/animal's name)

[23:38:01.0206] <ljharb>
but in general? it's the most important thing :-)

[23:38:41.0147] <ljharb>
i still pronounce it "jay sawn" but i do that knowing that i'm wrong, and the correct pronunciation is "jason"

[23:38:48.0929] <ljharb>
people can say "giff" all they want as long as they accept they're wrong

[23:39:55.0209] <rkirsling>
it just seems weird to say "wrong" if the goal isn't to be right :)

[23:40:02.0578] <ljharb>
why isn't that the goal

[23:40:05.0941] <ljharb>
but also why is the goal relevant

[23:40:07.0906] <rkirsling>
"not what they intended", absolutely

[23:40:26.0584] <rkirsling>
 * "not what they intended", absolutely

[23:40:31.0058] <ljharb>
when people on fox news make claims that are objectively false, for example, their goal isn't to be correct. they're still wrong. the goal has no impact on correctness.

[23:40:42.0977] <ljharb>
 * when people on fox news make claims that are objectively false, for example, their goal isn't to be correct. they're still wrong. the goal has no impact on correctness.

[23:41:11.0629] <ljharb>
(which also means, being wrong won't deter them. and that's "fine". but they're still wrong.)

[23:41:18.0168] <ljharb>
 * (which also means, being wrong won't deter them. and that's "fine". but they're still wrong.)

[23:42:18.0807] <rkirsling>
I mean that feels awfully irrelevant since we're not talking about misinformation; a better example that came to my attention recently would be the word "bade"

[23:42:29.0235] <rkirsling>
apparently it _should_ be pronounced the same as "bad"

[23:42:33.0948] <ljharb>
sure

[23:42:35.0329] <rkirsling>
 * apparently it _should_ be pronounced the same as "bad"

[23:42:45.0273] <rkirsling>
but if you say it that way I will openly be like "what"

[23:43:07.0382] <ljharb>
sure. that you need to be wrong to be understood doesn't make you less wrong :-) it just means other concerns take priority.

[23:43:08.0817] <rkirsling>
because nobody knows that and the unintuitive pronunciation has already died

[23:43:28.0190] <ljharb>
altho word pronunciation is trickier, what with descriptivism vs prescriptivism and linguistic evolution and whatnot

[23:43:37.0892] <ljharb>
nobody named it "bade", it's just a word

[23:43:41.0251] <ljharb>
someone named it "json" or "gif". they're a different category.

[23:43:48.0886] <ljharb>
 * someone named it "json" or "gif". they're a different category.

[23:44:02.0759] <rkirsling>
those aren't not words just 'cause somebody coined 'em

[23:44:19.0033] <rkirsling>
somebody came up with "yeet"

[23:44:21.0605] <ljharb>
i think they might eventually evolve into the same category, sure

[23:44:28.0638] <ljharb>
but nobody knows who coined "yeet"

[23:44:43.0566] <ljharb>
there is a known, single, creator of the names we're discussing. they're distinct.

[23:44:44.0718] <rkirsling>
sure but it's the same thing for JSON

[23:44:46.0579] <rkirsling>
 * sure but it's the same thing for JSON

[23:44:51.0888] <ljharb>
i don't think it is

[23:45:01.0755] <rkirsling>
I genuinely don't care who came up with it, 'cause it's now effectively everyone's

[23:45:26.0988] <ljharb>
i think that's a reasonable claim at some point. i don't think that claim holds up here tho.

[23:45:34.0051] <rkirsling>
it could have a prescribed pronunciation in the spec if it wanted to but yeah

[23:45:41.0591] <rkirsling>
 * it could have a prescribed pronunciation in the spec if it wanted to but yeah

[23:45:42.0058] <ljharb>
maybe because 20 years is too short a time period, maybe because the creator is still alive

[23:46:14.0890] <ljharb>
eg when crock's gone then there'll be a much stronger argument that the pronunciation belongs to the commons

[23:46:54.0650] <ljharb>
the other thing is that with json, the pronunciation isn't meant to evoke anything

[23:47:00.0376] <rkirsling>
but like, just because its creator is known doesn't mean that the majority know who that is

[23:47:08.0061] <rkirsling>
I don't remember who the GIF guy is

[23:47:08.0649] <ljharb>
but for gif, it 100% is meant to be "choosy developers choose gif", like "choosy moms chose jif" peanut butter

[23:47:37.0248] <ljharb>
like that is verbatim the origin story

[23:47:52.0435] <rkirsling>
yeah I follow

[23:48:00.0143] <rkirsling>
I mean, it's an amusing case

[23:48:10.0532] <rkirsling>
but it is nothing other than language change in action

[23:48:12.0562] <ljharb>
i think it's just a different category, even though in the fullness of time it will be the same

[23:48:24.0904] <ljharb>
right but "in action" is a distinct time period from "changed"

[23:48:37.0815] <ljharb>
also with json, the "wrong" one is much more universal than the one for gif

[23:49:00.0415] <rkirsling>
two competing conventions, just as in Wisconsin people fight over whether "bag" is pronounced with the vowel of "dad" or the vowel of "day"

[23:49:11.0751] <ljharb>
sure but that's regional. this one is global.

[23:49:23.0924] <rkirsling>
that's...not a difference?

[23:49:46.0843] <ljharb>
if you're trying to claim "the populace" decides, then "all the populace" versus "a tiny chunk of it" definitely is a difference

[23:50:00.0928] <ljharb>
meaning like, outside wisconsin people don't fight about that

[23:50:03.0709] <rkirsling>
I didn't mean to claim that there's a final verdict delivered

[23:50:08.0200] <ljharb>
sure, nor am i

[23:50:11.0026] <rkirsling>
it's statistical

[23:50:23.0383] <ljharb>
i'm saying that what people fight about in one state, when there's no fight outside it, is kind of irrelevant :-)

[23:50:47.0898] <rkirsling>
yeah but "the JS community" could just as well be a virtual state :)

[23:50:52.0394] <ljharb>
if the pronunciation of json or gif or whatever was that granularly regional then i'd cave too

[23:51:17.0004] <ljharb>
i mean, outside of the js community nobody even says "json" so i'm not sure they count. "gif" ofc is a ~universal word~ universally used term

[23:51:51.0880] <ljharb>
 * i mean, outside of the js community nobody even says "json" so i'm not sure they count. "gif" ofc is a ~universal word~ universally used term

[23:51:52.0422] <rkirsling>
the relevance of Wisconsin in that example is that it's the location of a battleground where two language regions meet

[23:51:57.0455] <ljharb>
 * i mean, outside of the js community nobody even says "json" so i'm not sure they count. "gif" ofc is a ~~universal word~~ universally used term

[23:52:01.0602] <ljharb>
 * i mean, outside of the js community nobody even says "json" so i'm not sure they count. "gif" ofc is a ~universal word~ universally used term

[23:52:03.0415] <rkirsling>
but regions don't need to be geographical

[23:52:41.0218] <ljharb>
ok, but "the population that uses a term" is the group that matters

[23:52:49.0581] <rkirsling>
my point is that there could be a "winner" 100 years from now on that debate in Wisconsin

[23:52:53.0810] <ljharb>
sure

[23:53:02.0709] <ljharb>
but bag isn't a coined term

[23:54:07.0450] <rkirsling>
I mean I'm trying to say that you're viewing this as a more special thing than it is

[23:54:12.0452] <ljharb>
also it's part of a larger dialect, it's not just that word that's pronounced differently

[23:54:40.0993] <ljharb>
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø i disagree, i think this is indeed a special category of thing (not unique to tech but certainly common there because we make up so many terms)

[23:54:48.0135] <ljharb>
 * ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø i disagree, i think this is indeed a special category of thing (not unique to tech but certainly common there because we make up so many terms)

 * ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø i disagree, i think this is indeed a special category of thing (not unique to tech but certainly common there because we make up so many terms)

[23:55:33.0156] <rkirsling>
like if a word gets loaned into a different language, it takes on a new life in that second language, and in particular, there could even be some period of people disagreeing on how to pronounce it in that second language

[23:56:18.0161] <rkirsling>
when you put your thing out into the world and it is met with enthusiastic reception, the conventions of the masses come into play

[23:56:24.0143] <ljharb>
if a *word* does, sure. but this isn't about words.

[23:56:33.0848] <rkirsling>
it's literally nothing other than a word

[23:56:48.0889] <ljharb>
a word that a living human chose and is acknowledged as the creator of, is quite different from a regular word.

lol this sounds like the transpiler/compiler thing, where compiler people insist transpilers are just regular compilers, but that's just because they can't discern the distinction that transpiler people find critically useful

[23:57:47.0898] <ljharb>
you may not discern this distinction but that doesn't mean it's not there or that it's not useful :-)

[23:58:03.0299] <ljharb>
 * you may not discern this distinction but that doesn't mean it's not there or that it's not useful :-)

[23:58:44.0217] <rkirsling>
I mean it's a subtle matter

[23:58:53.0701] <rkirsling>
the issue is that it's not a brand

[23:59:00.0306] <rkirsling>
like, it wouldn't need to be, but

[23:59:04.0401] <ljharb>
sure, it's not part of a legal entity

[23:59:09.0020] <rkirsling>
if it _were_, then you'd be like

[23:59:13.0006] <ljharb>
but the pronunciation of a legal entity is in the same bucket imo

[23:59:18.0345] <rkirsling>
"dude, stop pronouncing Coca-Cola wrong"

[23:59:21.0824] <ljharb>
yep

[23:59:53.0790] <ljharb>
there is a single correct pronunciation of it, at least in one language/region (i'm sure some global companies have official pronunciations that vary by language/region, but let's set that aside)

[00:00:23.0929] <rkirsling>
I mean like, honestly I don't disagree with you that it's _interesting_ that it shouldn't matter what the creator wanted

[00:00:31.0887] <rkirsling>
that was indeed my original point

[00:00:35.0415] <ljharb>
it's interesting that it *doesn't* matter to everyone

[00:00:45.0488] <ljharb>
"shouldn't" may be something we disagree on :-)

[00:01:02.0837] <rkirsling>
sorry that was the other meaning of "should"

[00:01:12.0614] <rkirsling>
the hypothetical one

[00:01:19.0191] <ljharb>
but the correctness of one of these kinds of pronunciations isn't changed by any of this. it just means being wrong might not make a difference in many cases.

[00:01:54.0555] <ljharb>
what i also find interesting is how strongly people will fight against being thought of as "wrong" even if they don't care about the way they're wrong in the first place :-)

[00:02:16.0961] <rkirsling>
hmm but I feel like that's just a matter of word choice

[00:02:44.0352] <ljharb>
if word choice is so important, why isn't pronunciation choice :-p

[00:03:41.0520] <rkirsling>
I mean US and UK aren't calling each other's pronunciation "wrong" üòÖ

[00:04:02.0886] <rkirsling>
I simply said that the creator doesn't have control over the fate of how the populace refers to their creation

[00:04:03.0018] <ljharb>
lol i have heard many people from both countries say exactly that

[00:04:12.0403] <ljharb>
i agree the creator doesn't have control over that.

[00:04:21.0334] <rkirsling>
yes yes there is of course rivalry there but still

[00:04:25.0055] <ljharb>
but the populace also doesn't have control over which pronunciation is objectively correct. they just may not care.

[00:04:32.0049] <ljharb>
 * but the populace also doesn't have control over which pronunciation is objectively correct. they just may not care.

[00:05:11.0070] <ljharb>
(in the case of JSON, crock has explicitly said he doesn't care how it's pronounced, so the case for correctness there is super weak - that is not the case for GIF tho.)

[00:05:23.0973] <ljharb>
 * (in the case of JSON, crock has explicitly said he doesn't care how it's pronounced, so the case for correctness there is super weak - that is not the case for GIF tho.)

[00:05:39.0023] <rkirsling>
there's also a notion of a "usefully incorrect" pronunciation

[00:06:16.0562] <ljharb>
as long as the word "incorrect" is attached, there's probably lots of ways that'd be useful

[00:06:42.0860] <ljharb>
i'll pronounce something however it takes to get it understood, i'll just know i might be wrong doing it :-)

[00:07:05.0009] <rkirsling>
I was thinking about this because I hear tem-PO-ral quite a bit when it's correctly TEM-po-ral, but I don't look down on this other pronunciation because I consider it to be driven by an aim to clearly articulate the O

[00:08:03.0045] <ljharb>
acking it's wrong wouldn't mean it's looked down on

[00:08:12.0841] <ljharb>
being wrong isn't a shameful thing, sometimes it's just fact

[00:08:33.0583] <ljharb>
("temporal" is an actual word tho, so it's not really a strong example of what i'm claiming gif/json are)

[00:09:02.0801] <rkirsling>
again, they're all words lol

[00:09:17.0916] <rkirsling>
the creator is equivalent to like, the academie francaise or something

[00:09:43.0454] <rkirsling>
(I have to reach for another country since we don't really have an equivalent, heh)

[00:09:53.0903] <ljharb>
an interesting analogy since they will definitely tell you you're pronouncing things wrong

[00:09:56.0852] <ljharb>
 * an interesting analogy since they will definitely tell you you're pronouncing things wrong

[00:10:28.0646] <ljharb>
but yeah now we're back to the previous thing where i claim there is a subtle but distinct and important category that gif and json are in, but traditional dictionary words are not

[00:11:14.0838] <rkirsling>
but you can probably find a word other than "yeet" with a clearly identifiable originator

[00:11:24.0030] <rkirsling>
isn't "cheugy" an example of that?

[00:11:38.0636] <rkirsling>
but that too will probably evolve in a flash

[00:11:39.0152] <ljharb>
afaik that only has one pronunciation

[00:11:44.0664] <rkirsling>
(or die out)

[00:11:47.0103] <ljharb>
possibly because it was coined on a video medium

[00:12:15.0627] <ljharb>
also that's a term for a concept, not for a concrete thing, so maybe that's another difference

[00:12:41.0498] <rkirsling>
yeah I'm just saying, somebody could like, counterpopularize it with a slightly different pronunciation or spelling or meaning or whatever

[00:13:03.0070] <ljharb>
sure. and that might become the prevailing pronunciation. it'd still be wrong. and that's ok.

[00:13:52.0491] <rkirsling>
but then where do you draw a line?

[00:14:06.0003] <rkirsling>
"boo" is presumably a willfully "incorrect" form of "beau"

[00:14:13.0821] <ljharb>
nobody coined that term

[00:14:32.0103] <rkirsling>
sigh

[00:14:43.0892] <ljharb>
atm (i haven't like, thought this out academically) the line is "did a living person name it, and does it refer to a concrete thing as opposed to a concept? they decide what's right"

[00:14:48.0770] <rkirsling>
it doesn't matter if the originator is known

[00:14:56.0335] <ljharb>
i hear it doesn't to you. it does to me.

[00:15:01.0795] <ljharb>
and usually to the originator.

[00:15:09.0004] <rkirsling>
again, I don't know offhand and frankly don't care who created the GIF format

[00:15:25.0641] <ljharb>
i don't know the name without googling. but they exist and are alive and created it with a specific intended pronunciation.

[00:15:45.0804] <ljharb>
that defines what's correct even if no other human ever uses the correct pronunciation

[00:16:35.0436] <ljharb>
language can be descriptivist but names are not

[00:16:42.0099] <rkirsling>
I mean I agree that absolutely should be indicated in a dictionary entry

[00:17:03.0288] <rkirsling>
but the most important info would be "what do you expect to hear it as"

[00:17:15.0357] <ljharb>
that's fine. but that has no bearing on correctness.

[00:17:29.0444] <ljharb>
it just means that "what's correct" isn't necessarily the most important consideration

[00:17:34.0728] <ljharb>
it does not erase "what's correct"

[00:18:36.0675] <rkirsling>
> <@rkirsling:matrix.org> maybe? but then correctness isn't the thing in question, I guess

yeah I mean that was what I said 40 minutes ago üòÇ (holy crap how has it been this long of a conversation)

[00:20:06.0792] <rkirsling>
anyway good battling with you

[00:20:30.0528] <rkirsling>
think I'm gonna catch some z's üòõ

[10:51:42.0904] <Richard Gibson>
> but you can probably find a word other than "yeet" with a clearly identifiable originator

Isn't "daemon" an example? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)#Terminology

[12:38:04.0485] <ljharb>
that‚Äôs a real word having a coined meaning, which I‚Äôm more inclined to treat as just a word
