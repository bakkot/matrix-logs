I wonder if "just" adding JSX to the syntax would cause any actual conflicts with the existing use of `<` for less-than comparisons? According to its [spec](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/), the JSXElement and JSXFragment are added as new PrimaryExpressions.

I would love to understand why JSX would need to be added as syntax, and why a built-in template tag litteral is not sufficient to support these use cases. I do realize some cases would require a little more verbose escaping, and that IDEs would need to get better at understanding DSLs in template tags, but that doesn't seem like a fundamental blocker to me. There have been a lot of discussions on this topic in ES Discourse, and I still don't understand the requirement for new syntax besides familiarity with JSX.

Besides any other reasons, one aspect of JSX that I observe is that it works really well as a suburb for representing an XML-ish structure in JS. Since its release almost a decade ago, I think the only real change to the syntax has been the addition of fragments. Rather than inspiring alternatives, it's been adopted pretty much directly by a number of other front-end frameworks.

So given that a tagged template literal is in many ways easier to implement than something like JSX, I would point at the popularity of JSX and the rarity of comparable template literal solutions as a really strong indicator of the strength of the syntax.

Whilst I agree that the popularity is a very strong signal of the need for some solution, there's been significant interest in evolving JSX with a new version for a long time, so I suspect what we have today is not the final form.

basically, same reason as type annotation. they want to unfork the language, so let's do the same with JSX. why template literal does not work is documented in JSX spec https://facebook.github.io/jsx/#sec-why-not-template-literals

[20:34:56.0956] <Mathieu Hofman>
Right that argument is the one about verbosity of escaping that I mention. I would say the example given in that spec is biased because JSX has somewhat magical treatment of tags. I am not convinced that tag names should be dynamically bound to the surrounding context, which means they may not need to be escaped in the first place. And the note about syntax highlighting does not refer to an intrinsic limitation of tagged templates, tools could parse tagged templates litterals.

i think the only thing i would want to fix about jsx is `className`

everything else is perfect

That's React not JSX ðŸ˜‰

ah perfect then

[01:42:14.0777] <eemeli>
From a process point of view, I'd say that the persistence of JSX is a pretty good indicator of a "problem or need" existing in the desirability of an ergonomic syntax for representing XML-ish structures, as well as providing a "general shape of a solution". So for stage-1 I'd be surprised by strong opposition.

For stage-2, though, Mathieu Hofman's concerns are very real, and do need to be addressed. For myself, I'm most persuaded by considering the replacement cost of JSX's reliance on variables in the current scope, which allows for `<Box>` to contain a reference to a variable `Box`, rather than needing to be `<${Box}>` or to be processed together with some explicitly created context like `{ Box }`.

I think that's a key feature which has allowed JSX to succeed, and which ought to be retained in any spec solution.
