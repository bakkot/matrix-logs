I wonder if "just" adding JSX to the syntax would cause any actual conflicts with the existing use of `<` for less-than comparisons? According to its [spec](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/), the JSXElement and JSXFragment are added as new PrimaryExpressions.

I would love to understand why JSX would need to be added as syntax, and why a built-in template tag litteral is not sufficient to support these use cases. I do realize some cases would require a little more verbose escaping, and that IDEs would need to get better at understanding DSLs in template tags, but that doesn't seem like a fundamental blocker to me. There have been a lot of discussions on this topic in ES Discourse, and I still don't understand the requirement for new syntax besides familiarity with JSX.
