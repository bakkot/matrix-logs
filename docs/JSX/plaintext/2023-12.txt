> <@mhofman:matrix.org> I am ok exploring the problems of representing tree structures, but I am very skeptical it should take the shape of new syntax. Tagged templates litterals were added to the language to solve exactly this kind of problem, and the fact they have been used exactly for this same use case by other frameworks show JSX is not the only viable approach.

I think that tagged templates for representing tree structures comes at the cost of runtime parsing and processing of the template. Unlike jsx which is already structured on the desired way as an object structure.

In both cases it's text that has to be parsed. If the tag is built-in, I don't see the difference.

Would it then be some kind of special case of tagged templates with it's own specific call semantics?

[18:23:32.0501] <Mathieu Hofman>
No, why? The tag function gets passed an array of strings, and has to parse those according to the DSL it implements. If the function is natively implemented, the parsing can be as efficient as parsing the string of JS source code. Also the string array is immutable with unique identity, so the parsing can be cached.

I see your what you mean.

well, the problem I think tagged template literal have, is exactly stated in the JSX doc

if tagged templates make me write ${Component} everywhere i'm never going to use them over a babel transform

On the other hand, the special semantics of tag names in JSX are weird at best. From what I recall, some html tags do not require scoped references for tags by relying on the custom element registry. Of course making that generic enough yet ergonomic is the hard problem
