> <@mhofman:matrix.org> I am ok exploring the problems of representing tree structures, but I am very skeptical it should take the shape of new syntax. Tagged templates litterals were added to the language to solve exactly this kind of problem, and the fact they have been used exactly for this same use case by other frameworks show JSX is not the only viable approach.

I think that tagged templates for representing tree structures comes at the cost of runtime parsing and processing of the template. Unlike jsx which is already structured on the desired way as an object structure.

In both cases it's text that has to be parsed. If the tag is built-in, I don't see the difference.

Would it then be some kind of special case of tagged templates with it's own specific call semantics?
