First he's sorry about not being able to make it this morning. From what I understand the biggest concern with adding prototype methods to shared structs is that it makes it too easy to transform existing single threaded code into shared memory multi-threaded code without the author realizing the implication of such a transformation. This is especially true with non-shared structs also existing as you're roughly a "shared" keyword away from transforming into multithreaded existing but non thread safe code.

Java and C# do not prevent object instances from being shared in the first place, so the problem in these languages is arguably worse since it's pretty much not up to the implementer of the class to enable multi-threading (at best it can document that the class is not thread safe). The current shared struct proposal does require opt-in by marking the struct type as shared, but we consider that to not be a sufficient friction point in transforming non multi-threaded code, as it's highly unlikely that simply marking a struct as shared to be sufficient, and that explicit locking logic is likely to be required as well in the methods.</td></tr>

Would it make sense that by default (without some kind of explicit opt-out), all methods of a shared struct would take a thread local lock on the instance. By that I mean every time a shared struct method is invoked, it'd check if the thread already has a lock on the object (in case of local re-entrancy or simply the method being called from another method), and if not, acquire a lock on the object. While that's unlikely to be sufficient to reliably protect the users of the object, it should at least make the methods implementations thread safe by default.</td></tr>
