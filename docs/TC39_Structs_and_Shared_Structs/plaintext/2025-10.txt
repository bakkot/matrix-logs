I'm not sure what involvement shu plans to have in this proposal following his departure from Google, so I'll let him speak to that. As for myself, I hope to start working on this again soon (though likely not until after Tokyo). We would likely need additional involvement from someone else on the V8 team given that most of the experimentation and data we have so far came from V8.
