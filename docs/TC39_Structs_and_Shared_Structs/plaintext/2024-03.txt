Hey shu,  tomorrow is actually not a great time for Mark and I. I know it's last minute but maybe Thursday would work for everyone?

[14:39:06.0529] <Mathieu Hofman>
We also need to discuss a little more between him and I to make this follow up discussion more productive, and I was too tired after my travels last week to catch up with him.

Chatting with Mark yesterday, we realized that the wasm shared everything thread is pretty strict about shared stuff not being able to access non shared stuff. Which brings the question, are there no use cases where shared funcs need to "call" a host function (which I assume is non-shared?). How would that work?
