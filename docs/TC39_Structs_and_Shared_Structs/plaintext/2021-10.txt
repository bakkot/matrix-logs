i was thinking of getting a monthly working session call started on structs. i'll put a tentative calendar invite out, we can hash out times when asumu is back

Sounds good to me.

I'm hoping to finish up an update for resource-management for the next meeting, as I'm hoping a RAII-style `using const ...` declaration will be useful for locking for a future concurrent JS. I'd ask for stage 3, but my spec reviewers haven't had a chance to review the updated spec text.

While not as terse as `using value expr` was, I switched the bindingless form to `using const void = expr` because it made both the syntax and the algorithms much simpler.

(probable bikeshed at plenary to follow)

hi folks, i'd like to nail down a time for the first working session meeting this Thurs, Oct 21

[12:31:42.0967] <shu>
i've heard some conflicts for the current proposed time of 10-11AM PT

[12:32:02.0953] <shu>
asumu: does the current time work for you?
