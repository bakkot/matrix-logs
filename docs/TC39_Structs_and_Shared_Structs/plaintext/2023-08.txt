As far as topics for today, I've started experimenting with the shared structs trial in the TypeScript compiler and have some early feedback.

As promised, here is a rough sketch of the handshaking mechanism I was thinking about: https://gist.github.com/rbuckton/08d020fc80da308ad3a1991384d4ff62

If we end up having this concept of thread-local fields, or a thread-local `[[Prototype]]`, do we actually need shared structs? Could we solve the same problem by introducing `shared` and `fixed` fields on a `class` instead? In other words, treat all non-`shared` fields as just thread-local fields, while having all `fixed` fields establish a fixed shape for an object, with the remaining non-`fixed` fields at the end?

I suppose you'd still need to indicate whether non-`shared` fields are "structured clone"-able.

And this could all be potentially handled via privileged decorators rather than keywords, i.e.:

```js
@Shareable()
class Foo {
  @Shared()
  x;

  @Shared()
  y;

  @Copiable()
  data;

  @ThreadLocal()
  toString() { ... }
}
```
