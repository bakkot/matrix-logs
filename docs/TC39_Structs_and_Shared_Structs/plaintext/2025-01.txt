hi folks, i have no new topics to discuss for the next structs call, but would like someone there to jog my memory (kriskowal and nicolo-ribaudo preferably) on where exactly we left off and agreed on for the module identity thing for per-realm prototypes

Kris is out this week. I'm a bit tied up but if necessary I can free myself up tomorrow.

[11:43:09.0074] <shu>
we can also postpone until kris is back

[12:09:51.0404] <Mathieu Hofman>
Postponing by a week would work for us

thoughts on prohibiting computed property names in struct bodies? with structs positioned as "restricted classes that trade expressivity for performance and analyzability", prohibiting computed property names furthers the analyzability goal
