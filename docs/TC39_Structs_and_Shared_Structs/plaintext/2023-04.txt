finally catching up on old code sharing threads

rbuckton: i applaud the scope of "shared modules" but i feel that is tantamount to designing a new language, which is not incremental and significantly increases risk of adoption or shipping anything.

put another way, IMO the only realistic way to move the needle for multithreading for JS is to have an opt-in carve out for shared memory. shared structs _is_ that opt-in. to have "shared modules" seems to require the capability to write code that is actual parallel and threadsafe _in general_, including a threadsafe stdlib. were i to do a greenfield project i'd design a stdlib with that in mind but i feel like that would be too much to bite off at the moment?

[17:04:07.0407] <shu>
more i think about it, i think the non-threadsafe stdlib thing is the actual showstopper for me

I'm coming at this from two different directions, with two different outcomes:

1. Design something transformative for the language, adding cohesive and comprehensive new capabilities.
2. Design something tacked on to the language, adding a minimal set of capabilities necessary to solve a specific problem.

Option 1 is complex, takes longer, and requires a fair amount of "big design upfront", all to support capabilities we may or may not need. However, the end goal is to have something cohesive that is future-leaning with few "warts". That's what "shared modules" is, or is intended to be.

Option 2 is far simpler (though not trivial), shorter term, and focused. While this approach allows for incremental change, we may in the future find that related capabilities are harder to implement in the future because of design decisions we make now, potentially leaving more "warts" in the design over time.

I'm not opposed to either direction, but its worth considering the former even if only to inform the latter.

> <@shuyuguo:matrix.org> more i think about it, i think the non-threadsafe stdlib thing is the actual showstopper for me

The "shared modules" approach would have required a threadsafe stdlib subset (i.e., make operations threadsafe if possible, and throw when not).

[05:02:42.0059] <rbuckton>
I find the "only share data, but register per-thread behavior" approach acceptable, so long as we have a reasonable way to register per-thread behavior.

[05:04:58.0534] <rbuckton>
That's the approach I took with https://esfx.js.org/esfx/api/struct-type.html?tabs=ts, though it's not so much "registration" and is more of a "wrap an ArrayBuffer with a DataView"-like approach.

[07:30:50.0550] <shu>
i'm saying something stronger for (1). my intuition is that "transformative" for JS actually means "not adoptable and unrealistic"

[10:42:59.0088] <littledan>
Yeah, I think it's good to *consider* 1, but after years of considering it, I haven't seen a realistic path for it. Do you? This informs my agreement with Shu's choice of 2.

[10:43:20.0356] <littledan>
Are there other things about it we should consider? Other potential takeaways to inform things further?

[13:29:34.0496] <Mathieu Hofman>
I remain convinced that sharing initialization code between realms, and in this case between agents, is also a general problem that is relevant for this proposal and for others (extensible cloning for example, or recursive initialization of ShadowRealms). I believe this problem can be solved without being transformative to the language, just with targeted API additions and relying on other proposals in progress like module expressions. So going towards (2) does not mean the solution has to be specific to this proposal.

[13:30:15.0475] <littledan>
We're all agreed on sharing code, the question is whether to has to be the same copy of the code or not

[13:30:51.0930] <littledan>
my idea with module expressions has always been, it's the same code but different copies of it; different instances of the same module

[13:32:42.0755] <Mathieu Hofman>
Right I agree. I think multiple copies is sufficient, we just need to solve the registration ergonomics, which has different approaches possible, and where rbuckton and I disagree on.

[13:33:40.0643] <littledan>
yeah I agree registration economics is fraught. Could you elaborate on the disagreement?

[13:33:46.0510] <littledan>
bterlson: I think I saw you typing?

[13:34:08.0120] <littledan>
 * yeah I agree registration ergonomics is fraught. Could you elaborate on the disagreement?

[13:34:29.0946] <Mathieu Hofman>
Basically Ron suggested an implicit shared cross agent registry, which is a non starter in my book.

[13:34:30.0836] <bterlson>
littledan: I was just catching up and typed a bit :-D Just got back from paternity and have been out for many an eon, have no idea whats going on

[13:34:54.0868] <bterlson>
(and I want this feature in my project I'm working on)

Huh, I don't see why we'd bother with a new registry when we already have the module map

[13:35:27.0429] <littledan>

Oh! Could you say more?

[13:36:37.0767] <bterlson>
wasm stuff, can't say more yet :P

[13:37:14.0012] <littledan>
are we going to start living the multithreaded wasm gc dream?

[13:37:26.0568] <Mathieu Hofman>
The module map is agent specific, different agents may have a different module map. The main question is independent initialization and what happens when you receive a shared struct from another agent, whether there is a relation to the "same" shared struct that may have been declared in the local agent

[13:38:08.0225] <Mathieu Hofman>
basically identity discontinuity

[13:39:03.0630] <littledan>
wait, I thought a limited form of "identity discontinuity" was a given: We're taking that we have different *copies* of the functions and prototype (which ideally do the same thing)

[13:39:39.0513] <littledan>
do you mean, the risk that it won't just be identity discontinuity, but a greater level where the actual behavior won't match up?
