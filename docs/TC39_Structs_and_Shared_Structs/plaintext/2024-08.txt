I seem to have bludgeoned the Join button enough times for Matrix to acknowledge my presence.

Welcome

kriskowal: I tried to DM you the link I mentioned, but there are two matrix identities for you in the delegates chat and I may have sent them to the wrong one. Here's what I sent, in any case:

Alternatively, this other gist details possible mechanisms to grant/deny correlation as well as to support bundlers when correlating by source location: https://gist.github.com/rbuckton/b00ca9660fb888486da07b22e38dd1e9

Yeah, Matrix isn’t good at chat. One cannot simply start up a new Matrix instance with friends and migrate their identity, much less convince Matrix the old one is gone, especially when matrix.org has forgotten its side of the credentials for it.

By a glance, it looks like this design direction hasn’t been considered or was dismissed out-of-hand:
```
struct Foo {}
addEventListener('message', event => {
  const foo = new Foo(event.data.foo);
});
```
Wherein, `Foo` is an opaque struct definition closing over the vm-specific vagaries of padding, alignment, embedding, dereferencing, &c, `event.data.foo` is an opaque handle on shared memory without behavior, and `new Foo(event.data.foo)` unites the data and behavior.
