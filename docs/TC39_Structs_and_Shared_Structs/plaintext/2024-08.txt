I seem to have bludgeoned the Join button enough times for Matrix to acknowledge my presence.

Welcome

kriskowal: I tried to DM you the link I mentioned, but there are two matrix identities for you in the delegates chat and I may have sent them to the wrong one. Here's what I sent, in any case:

For reference, this Gist contains a brief analysis of an earlier proposed handshaking mechanism: https://gist.github.com/rbuckton/08d020fc80da308ad3a1991384d4ff62

Yeah, Matrix isnâ€™t good at chat. One cannot simply start up a new Matrix instance with friends and migrate their identity, much less convince Matrix the old one is gone, especially when matrix.org has forgotten its side of the credentials for it.
