are we meeting today?

[10:09:19.0249] <shu>
rescheduled to 1030-1100

[10:09:44.0322] <shu>
did the invite not go through?

[10:11:49.0663] <shu>
argh this is a problem with the entry on the TC39 calendar vs the one that existed before, i think

[10:12:03.0283] <shu>
the one that existed before has a list of people on it, and the TC39 calendar one doesn't

[10:12:25.0765] <Mathieu Hofman>
ah yeah I only have the tc39 calendar one

[10:12:51.0940] <shu>
