Is there an agenda for the shared structs meeting? (after the plenary presentation, I'm considering attending)

[09:02:55.0208] <nicolo-ribaudo>
It seems like there are some common problems to solve between shared structs and modules, with regards to what does it mean to "be the same code"

I think we're hoping that Mark will show up and we can continue the discussion from plenary

[09:34:27.0689] <shaylew>
IMO the most awkward thing about the "same code" question is that WASM linking -- and especially WASM gc reference types -- already has a coherent answer to what it means for types to be compatible/identical/etc 

[09:34:56.0155] <shaylew>
(a story based on exporting types and type witnesses)

[09:35:42.0684] <littledan>
do you have a reference for the type witness thing? I thought it was all structural

[09:35:47.0654] <shaylew>
and it's not been clear to me which parts of that story are possible or desirable to also do in JS, but it would sure make things simpler to use some of the same principles

[09:36:31.0314] <shaylew>
uhhh I don't know which parts of WASM are real and which are still imaginary, I read proposals and don't use it in practice yet

[09:37:44.0176] <shaylew>
but the exceptions/call tags pieces are definitely using witnesses and opaque coercions, and at least in some stage the GC proposal had some of that (for subtyping)

[09:41:58.0835] <littledan>
hmm yeah I don't see how/why we'd use those. I like the idea of identifying by parse node, and maybe adding onto that, reference (via module sources)
