Is there an agenda for the shared structs meeting? (after the plenary presentation, I'm considering attending)

It seems like there are some common problems to solve between shared structs and modules, with regards to what does it mean to "be the same code"

I think we're hoping that Mark will show up and we can continue the discussion from plenary

IMO the most awkward thing about the "same code" question is that WASM linking -- and especially WASM gc reference types -- already has a coherent answer to what it means for types to be compatible/identical/etc

(a story based on exporting types and type witnesses)
