shu: Are the origin trial shared structs not allowed to have fields that are stringified integers?

[14:25:56.0386] <shu>
rbuckton: it should, that looks like a bug

[14:26:01.0355] <shu>
i'll investigate soon, thanks for raising it

The more I tinker with this, trying to shoehorn it into the compiler, the more I want some mechanism to attach behavior.
I also had to implement a custom `Map`-like mechanism using shared structs to share some keyed data efficiently.

I have made some progress on parallel parsing, however. 

[15:44:56.0565] <shu>
i am working on the behavior thing

[15:45:10.0955] <shu>
more specifically, the thread-local storage thing

[15:45:46.0842] <shu>
our current GC scheme makes inter-heap cycles uncollectable, and i'm trying to fix that, which is taking a bit due to GC being finnicky
