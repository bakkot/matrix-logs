rbuckton: i don't think there'll be enough time this meeting to meaningfully discuss the design space of the proposal, as i'm focusing on an implementation experience report showcasing the challenges and feasibility of implementing the feature

[18:14:28.0141] <shu>
so i've avoided giving concrete examples about Symbol.dispose interaction with mutexes, as well as details about the method sharing ideas

[18:14:33.0848] <shu>
those will come in a later update, probably the next meeting

[18:14:43.0300] <shu>
i've shared the slides with you

[18:14:47.0561] <shu>
they're at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qhrn6w3hcD4_uD9ebKfz4Fd_tJqQyPOI-IlH8keWIfQ/edit?usp=sharing for others interested

Slides seem fine to me, though as someone not well versed in calligraphy its a bit hard to read "Implementability" on slide 7 (due to the shape of the "y"), "maximum" on slide 13 (due to the shape of the "x"), and "feedback" on slide 40 (due to the shape of the "k")
