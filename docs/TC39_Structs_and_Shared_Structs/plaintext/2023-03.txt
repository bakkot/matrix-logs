rbuckton: i don't think there'll be enough time this meeting to meaningfully discuss the design space of the proposal, as i'm focusing on an implementation experience report showcasing the challenges and feasibility of implementing the feature

[18:14:28.0141] <shu>
so i've avoided giving concrete examples about Symbol.dispose interaction with mutexes, as well as details about the method sharing ideas

[18:14:33.0848] <shu>
those will come in a later update, probably the next meeting

[18:14:43.0300] <shu>
i've shared the slides with you

[18:14:47.0561] <shu>
they're at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qhrn6w3hcD4_uD9ebKfz4Fd_tJqQyPOI-IlH8keWIfQ/edit?usp=sharing for others interested
