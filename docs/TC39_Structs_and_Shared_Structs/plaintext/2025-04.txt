Looks like Mark and I may have a last minute conflict for 11am today. What is on the agenda?

[10:25:07.0255] <Mathieu Hofman>
We might be able to split duties. I'll probably be a no-show but Mark might be able to still attend.

thanks for heads up

the only agenda was getting everyone on same page for the plan for strengthening non-extensibility

[11:12:46.0156] <shu>
which mark is already up-to-speed on

[11:12:57.0100] <littledan>
I'm so happy about that proposal!

thanks, hopefully it works out and the mapping software i don't want to break actually responds to outreach
