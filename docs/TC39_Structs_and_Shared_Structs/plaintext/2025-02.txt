It would be interesting to have a concept of born immutable object as that would allow to change the notion of equality for these objects. That's what records and tuples explored.

what would be different from what R&T explored?

probably R&T should just be shared structs (if you don't include anything non-shared in them)

[06:33:44.0660] <littledan>
now that we aren't making them primitives

[06:34:32.0882] <littledan>
we could use an updated equality function for Map and Set keys, while leaving === and Object.is and such unchanged
