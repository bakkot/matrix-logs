i do plan to have the call tomorrow if anyone's interested

[16:31:19.0088] <shu>
on my agenda is to talk about method sharing and prototype lookup

[16:33:45.0175] <Mathieu Hofman>
I mentioned to Ashley the other day it might be worth for him to join to discuss if there may be any similarities with the R&T proposal as was hinted by some during the last plenary. Will remind him of the call tomorrow

[16:36:24.0319] <shu>
indeed, that sounds great, thanks!

[04:38:07.0364] <Ashley Claymore>
Thanks Mathieu Hofman ! I am likely to be on a train home during the call, but will try and listen in on my mobile
