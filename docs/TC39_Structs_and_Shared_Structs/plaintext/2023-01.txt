i do plan to have the call tomorrow if anyone's interested

[16:31:19.0088] <shu>
on my agenda is to talk about method sharing and prototype lookup

[16:33:45.0175] <Mathieu Hofman>
I mentioned to Ashley the other day it might be worth for him to join to discuss if there may be any similarities with the R&T proposal as was hinted by some during the last plenary. Will remind him of the call tomorrow
