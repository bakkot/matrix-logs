i do plan to have the call tomorrow if anyone's interested

[16:31:19.0088] <shu>
on my agenda is to talk about method sharing and prototype lookup

[16:33:45.0175] <Mathieu Hofman>
I mentioned to Ashley the other day it might be worth for him to join to discuss if there may be any similarities with the R&T proposal as was hinted by some during the last plenary. Will remind him of the call tomorrow

[16:36:24.0319] <shu>
indeed, that sounds great, thanks!

[04:38:07.0364] <Ashley Claymore>
Thanks Mathieu Hofman ! I am likely to be on a train home during the call, but will try and listen in on my mobile 

[07:22:46.0511] <shu>
doh, a last minute conflict arose (apartment repair people)

[07:23:55.0649] <shu>
Ashley Claymore: if i move this one to the 26th 1 hour earlier (9am PT), would that work better for you?

[09:00:24.0264] <littledan>
OK, are we meeting now?

[09:02:00.0657] <littledan>
shu: ^

[09:06:39.0301] <littledan>
OK, I take it not

[09:08:36.0005] <Ashley Claymore>
Moved to next week on the TC39 events cal now

[09:13:28.0619] <Ashley Claymore>
Also feel free to have at the original time next week (10am PT), I'm getting an earlier train than I would usually today :)

Unfortunately I don't think I will be able to attend tomorrow due to a conflicting appointment. I don't have much to report, Wasm GC is moving towards getting a formal spec (& JS API spec) so if anything relevant comes out of that I'll report in future meetings.

[17:28:52.0881] <shu>
thanks asumu

^^ if missed before. Feel free to keep the 10am time, if that works better for asumu . My clash last week was not reoccurring

I'm also curious if we can leverage `using` with Mutex/ConditionVariable, since that was one of the reasons I focused on getting that proposal to Stage 3.
