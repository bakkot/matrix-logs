<p>the "can be used as weakmap keys" concern basically 100% rides on implementation feasibility from others at this point, and i don't think it's useful for this group to design around it yet</p>

the implementation constraint for me with that world is that we must be able to compile #-names in shared structs just as normal property slots. because of the "#-names have different identities depending on the evaluation of the class declaration" thing, they are wildly inefficient in engines. this problem might not exist at all if we have the restriction that struct decls are top-level only and thus can't be reevaluated anyways

so that sounds like a promising thing for us to explore</td></tr>

so it sounds like if we just introduce that method, here or independently, that solves it. everyone AFAIK agrees return override is loathsome so that method would be a good addition independently anyway</td></tr>

<p>That is great news</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah we've been going at this from different approaches for a couple years now. In the latest iteration we were thinking of a new explicit integrity level above "freeze", but I have to think if could we lower that to an explicit integrity level right above "prevent extensions". The thing is that we wanted to attach some different proxy trap semantics as well, and provide a signal to not trigger the override mistake, and I don't know if that can work in that case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for unsafe {}, mark is also happy with "all shared struct fields always private", then we don't need unsafe {}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had independently been mulling over this, and the 2 issues I came up with are:</p>
<ul>
<li>WASM integration: I doubt an FFI style approach and wasm having to go through JS would be acceptable for every shared field access?</li>
<li>shared struct extend: the semantics of privates in JS is lexical. I think we may need a notion of protected here. Or at least a way to extract and represent the power to access private fields (which could be used to solve the wasm issue as well)</li>
</ul>
