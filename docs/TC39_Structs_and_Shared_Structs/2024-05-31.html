Of course that doesn't guarantee the author will get it right.<br>Shared structs is an improvement over SAB for complex value types. However SAB did force you to think about what you were doing when coming from an object model. The concern here is that an author can too easily take a regular non shared aware class, and transform it into a shared struct, without really thinking about what they're doing.</td></tr>

Afaik, there is also no proposal for attaching prototypes to non-shared wasm refs either. So I fail to see how the complexity for this JS feature would already be there.</blockquote></mx-reply>For WASM shared objects to be remotely usable from JS, you need to be able to interact with them <em>somehow</em>. If they are opaque, that only means that interactions must go through a wrapper/Proxy, as littledan said, and also likely need to be valid <code>WeakMap</code> keys so that such proxies work. As a result, opaque WASM shared objects are not inherently safer, just slower due to indirection and FFI marshaling. When I brought up having WASM shared objects be opaque entities in a prior structs meeting, the main purpose was to discuss a <em>worst case</em> fallback position if we don't have a comprehensive story for JS shared objects. If WASM shared objects were to be introduced as ordinary JS objects and we were to want to later introduce JS shared structs with unique semantics around field reads and writes (such as what I discussed above re <code>unsafe</code>), then mutable WASM shared objects couldn't align with that approach without breaking existing consumers. Whether WASM shared objects are opaque or not has nothing to do with thread safety, only runtime semantic consistency. Thread safety is still a split responsibility between the shared object implementer and shared object consumer based on the needs of any given use case.</td></tr>
