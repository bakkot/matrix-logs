To expand on my earlier idea, I think we don't need any stable identity for module blocks or even symbols, we can just use shared structs themselves to dynamically attach behavior to a shared struct kind, given some built-in wiring. Here is a gist where I explore that approach: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mhofman/aa23fcc88e1ccd031a3c34f88577eaf7">https://gist.github.com/mhofman/aa23fcc88e1ccd031a3c34f88577eaf7</a></p>
<p>It does not require any new syntax, or extra magic in postMessage (like module blocks, or symbol identities being preserved). It only requires an automatically generated static property on shared struct classes that represent the kind, and some built-in behavior, plus the dynamic prototype lookup we discussed of course. I'm actually wondering if this could be prototyped (pun intented) in the current experiment.</p>

(also method chaining, but <code>|&gt;</code> operator would also give that).<br>'type' here being the identity created by the <code>shared struct class</code> syntax (the fan-out case).<br>For the fan-in case, where a farm of workers start up on their own, each creating their own separate <code>shared struct class</code> (from the same module URL), as they are sent to a sink, the sink would need to register that one 'prototype' with the multiple 'type's that are received from each worker.</td></tr>

You're right at the end of the day this boils down to the capability of setting the dynamic prototype to use for instances.</td></tr>

</blockquote></mx-reply>I have actually been wondering about that, and whether that's an observable thing from the 262 spec point of view. The only program observable aspect of this is the preservation of identity through cross agent interactions, which is host defined anyway.</td></tr>

</blockquote></mx-reply>Not really. If the prototype is set once and maybe throws when accessed before, then it's arguably sealed for that agent. As I mentioned, the fact there is a single reference shared between agents is an implementation detail IMO</td></tr>
