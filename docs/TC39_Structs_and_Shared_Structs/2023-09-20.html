<ul>
<li>the internal agent wide registry is an association from type to local behavior definition</li>

<li>you can only populate the agent wide registry through connection registries.</li>
</ul>
<p>that means a worker A connected to a worker B through M but not sharing the same connection registry will not be able share behavior throughout. I'm still wondering about the special parent - child relationship these connection based registries seem to have, and how you can only have one connection registry between 2 agents or things fall apart.
