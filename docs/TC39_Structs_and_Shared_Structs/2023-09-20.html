This is another reason why my proposal uses a preload script. The preload script performs the worker side of the handshake before any other data can be shared between the worker and M, so you cannot have a stray PointA sent to B, or PointB sent to A, prior to a completed handshake on both sides.</td></tr>

Workers will always be part of a tree that points back to some root agent, so there's always a way to collect these things. If the handshake establishes the relationship without the ability to pass messages, would that be sufficient to address concerns about a global registry?</td></tr>
