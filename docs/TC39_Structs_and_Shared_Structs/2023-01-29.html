<p>SharedStructType.getConstructor() is needed to allow the program to avoid duplicating type definitions in each agent/realm. I think the burden of such deduplication should be on the program, not on the engine.</p>
<p>If the engine had to deduplicate itself, you'd either need a user provided type identifier at "prepare" time, and a global lock around such type definitions, or you'd need to somehow be able to collapse separate definitions into a single one. In either case you'd have to figure out what to do if the shape definition does not match, and in the case of definition collapse, how do you communicate the error to the program?</p>
<p>By having the type definition generate the unique type identifier, you avoid all those complications in the engine, at the cost of putting more type hydration burden on the program.</p>
</blockquote></mx-reply>This assumes the worker can be sure the incoming message is actually for that prototype, which might not be the case if there are multiple possible values for the message. This design seems very hard to implement in user code, while my suggestion is more reliable for write-once and reuse.</td></tr>

If the user defined identity is already registered to a different shape, it should throw.</td></tr>

But I'm very doubtful we can overcome the issue with a user supplied identity.</td></tr>
