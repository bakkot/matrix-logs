<p>SharedStructType.getConstructor() is needed to allow the program to avoid duplicating type definitions in each agent/realm. I think the burden of such deduplication should be on the program, not on the engine.</p>
<p>If the engine had to deduplicate itself, you'd either need a user provided type identifier at "prepare" time, and a global lock around such type definitions, or you'd need to somehow be able to collapse separate definitions into a single one. In either case you'd have to figure out what to do if the shape definition does not match, and in the case of definition collapse, how do you communicate the error to the program?</p>
<p>By having the type definition generate the unique type identifier, you avoid all those complications in the engine, at the cost of putting more type hydration burden on the program.</p>

Your code defines the relationship between an id and a constructor/prototype on your agent. If your code tries to register the same unique id twice, it should be an error so you can isolate the problem early. If the constructor/prototype on one agent doesn't match the constructor/prototype on another agent, that's fine. In fact, that may even be a value add, since bundlers could potentially tree-shake away prototype methods that aren't used.</td></tr>
