<ol>
<li>I strongly hold that existing Reflect &amp; co APIs should not work on writable shared structs fields in non unsafe blocks.<br>a. I understand this may break existing code that blindly try to access objects, but technically this is already a possibility with exotic objects, and I really don't want to see us modify the shape of property descriptors.<br>b. It may be acceptable for some new dedicated Reflect APIs to access writable shared struct fields in non unsafe block, but I like the idea that "unsafe" access requires new syntax. It'd be a much more consistent model for audits.</li>
<li>I believe that existing Reflect &amp; co APIs should work on shared struct fields inside unsafe blocks. This is especially true if we don't have new dedicated unsafe APIs</li>
<li>At first I didn't like <code>function.unsafe</code> as it felt like a form of dynamic scoping, but I am now warming up to it. As explained it is similar to <code><a href="http://new.target">new.target</a></code>: the unsafe block changes the semantics of the call, like <code>new</code> would, and as the callee you get to sense the semantic change through some new piece of syntax.<br>a. Unlike construct, I don't think we need <code>Reflect.unsafeCall</code>/<code>Reflect.unsafeContruct</code> and the corresponding proxy traps as long as the existing call/construct traps get to sense through <code>function.unsafe</code>, so they can use an unsafe block to trigger the change of semantics on the target.</li>
<li><code>unsafe function () { ... }</code> would effectively be the equivalent of <code>function () { if (!function.unsafe) throw TypeError(); unsafe { ... } }</code></li>
<li>I like the idea of non-writable properties of shared structs being safe to access anywhere, but since the change from writable to non-writable is intrinsically dynamic, we have to consider whether we might opening too wide a door for authors to shoot themselves in the foot: since the access may not be audited as unsafe, they might not realize that there could be a race with the freezing of the property.<br>a. even if the property becomes non-writable at init, given that you can share the struct before init completes, it is still a dynamic state change</li>
</ol>
