Hello hello! 👋 Lovely to see so many familiar faces here!

I'm sure the TC39 process has changed quite a bit since the last time I've interacted with it – so I hope this is a reasonable place to start again :)

Specifically I'm here because of the ShadowRealm proposal – I'm wondering, I saw that there was discussion about moving it to Stage 3 but I guess that didn't happen and I can't find any details on that. So I'm both curious whether
 * that is an accurate representation of the latest state of the proposal, and
 * there is anything that a motivated person can do to help move it along at this point?

Hi Anna 👋
If helpful, it was last presented in Feb: https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/57892385c66ffd51df3148c8347e77b8b49338a5/meetings/2025-02/february-18.md?plain=1#L580
There was a "for stage 3" presentation December last year: https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/57892385c66ffd51df3148c8347e77b8b49338a5/meetings/2024-12/december-02.md?plain=1#L801

The conversations are primarily focused on the Web integration story - specifically which APIs are exposed within the ShadowRealm
AFAIK

Ashley Claymore: Thank you, that's great context :) Also, that's absolutely a reasonable problem to find the "right" answer to first.

I'd still be curious to know if there's a concrete things that one can do as an individual to help here, but there's nothing obvious that springs to my mind I guess

Reaching out to ptomato (intermittent availability) might be best. He's also been collecting a list of use cases, and always keen to add to that list
