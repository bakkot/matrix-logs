Hello hello! ðŸ‘‹ Lovely to see so many familiar faces here!

I'm sure the TC39 process has changed quite a bit since the last time I've interacted with it â€“Â so I hope this is a reasonable place to start again :)

Specifically I'm here because of the ShadowRealm proposal â€“Â I'm wondering, I saw that there was discussion about moving it to Stage 3 but I guess that didn't happen and I can't find any details on that. So I'm both curious whether
 * that is an accurate representation of the latest state of the proposal, and
 * there is anything that a motivated person can do to help move it along at this point?
