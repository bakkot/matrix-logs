You're in the "TC39 Beginners" chat room. It's 'owned' by TC39, the committee that maintains the ECMAScript spec, aka the JavaScript language.

[07:15:47.0119] <jmdyck>
The description I found for this room says "space for clarifying questions on terminology, process, history, etc". So I think "Beginners" refers to people who are new to the spec or new to the committee.

[07:16:53.0015] <jmdyck>
(rather than, say, people who are new to JavaScript)

[07:17:51.0431] <jmdyck>
(though if you're new to JavaScript, I don't think we'd turn you away)

okay cool, so this is the room where i think i will be hanging out in for quite a while

TC39 has a very colorful history and there are so many things i would be interested in knowing about that took place in the olden days of Netscape

one thing that i've been curious about is this so-called "ECMAScript Edition 4 Reference Implementation" that Brenden Eich blogged about in 2017 https://brendaneich.com/2007/06/ecmascript-edition-4-reference-implementation/
