[07:00:31.0217] <jmdyck>
What do you want to begin?

[07:08:18.0224] <Alexandra Hercilia Pereira Silva>
where i am?

You're in the "TC39 Beginners" chat room. It's 'owned' by TC39, the committee that maintains the ECMAScript spec, aka the JavaScript language.

[07:15:47.0119] <jmdyck>
The description I found for this room says "space for clarifying questions on terminology, process, history, etc". So I think "Beginners" refers to people who are new to the spec or new to the committee.

[07:16:53.0015] <jmdyck>
(rather than, say, people who are new to JavaScript)

[07:17:51.0431] <jmdyck>
(though if you're new to JavaScript, I don't think we'd turn you away)

okay cool, so this is the room where i think i will be hanging out in for quite a while

[17:37:40.0705] <DerekNonGeneric>
TC39 has a very colorful history and there are so many things i would be interested in knowing about that took place in the olden days of Netscape

[18:13:48.0505] <DerekNonGeneric>
one thing that i've been curious about is this so-called "ECMAScript Edition 4 Reference Implementation" that Brenden Eich blogged about in 2017 https://brendaneich.com/2007/06/ecmascript-edition-4-reference-implementation/

[18:20:00.0413] <DerekNonGeneric>
would anyone happen to know where to get a copy of this `es4-pre-release.M1.source.tar.gz` source archive that was publicly available a while ago? http://web.archive.org/web/20090606010542/http://www.ecmascript.org/download.php

have had no luck getting past the pesky agreement checkpoint to grab a copy -- it seems to interfere with the JS that internet archive uses for their time travel frame

(2007, not 2017.)

[19:05:24.0586] <DerekNonGeneric>
oh, good catch jmdyck

[19:12:05.0262] <DerekNonGeneric>
this is indeed weird... according to ecmascript.org, the 5th edition was approved

> The Fifth Edition of ECMA-262 has been approved!
> -- https://web.archive.org/web/20091214212324/http://www.ecmascript.org/

... but, according to [the official Ecma page](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) “ECMA-262 Edition 4” along with “ECMA-262 Edition 5” were not recognized as Ecma International publications, but somehow we ended up with only “ECMA-262 Edition 5.1” being recognized

[19:15:58.0723] <jmdyck>
I don't see where the page you linked to says that.

[19:16:23.0647] <DerekNonGeneric>
> Please note that for ECMAScript Edition 4 the Ecma standard number “ECMA-262 Edition 4” was reserved but not used in the Ecma publication process. Therefore “ECMA-262 Edition 4” as an Ecma International publication does not exist.

[19:16:58.0920] <jmdyck>
Yup, I see that. But not what you said about the 5th.

[19:17:40.0570] <jmdyck>
 * Yup, I see that. But not what you said about the 5th.

[19:17:51.0005] <DerekNonGeneric>
oh, if you keep scrolling below "Online Archives", it does show the 5th edition there

[19:17:59.0618] <jmdyck>
yup

[19:17:59.0949] <DerekNonGeneric>
my mistake!
