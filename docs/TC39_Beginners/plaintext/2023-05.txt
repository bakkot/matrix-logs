I'm not finding a public invite for the Matrix space. Is it possible to join it as a non-delegate?

why is it so hard to find the invites to these matrix channels or the space? The *only* place I can seem to find them mentioned at all is https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/a64ad4bf2276063bfd268d50d5fbe393369b9fff/matrix-guide.md, a somewhat obscure markdown file which also seems worded more towards *exclusively* TC39 delegates and not the general public

not even at the bottom of https://tc39.es/ in the "Connect" section is the existence of the matrix channels acknowledged, why is this?

the forums https://es.discourse.group/ are linked, but nowhere official in them is the matrix mentioned either, only in replies to a select few threads, which is how i happened to by luck manage to learn this place exists
