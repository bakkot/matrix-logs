I'm not finding a public invite for the Matrix space. Is it possible to join it as a non-delegate?

why is it so hard to find the invites to these matrix channels or the space? The *only* place I can seem to find them mentioned at all is https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/a64ad4bf2276063bfd268d50d5fbe393369b9fff/matrix-guide.md, a somewhat obscure markdown file which also seems worded more towards *exclusively* TC39 delegates and not the general public

[01:44:44.0374] <voidhedron>
not even at the bottom of https://tc39.es/ in the "Connect" section is the existence of the matrix channels acknowledged, why is this?

[01:49:16.0538] <voidhedron>
the forums https://es.discourse.group/ are linked, but nowhere official in them is the matrix mentioned either, only in replies to a select few threads, which is how i happened to by luck manage to learn this place exists

Not disputing anything you said, but https://tc39.es/ecma262/'s "Contributing" section does mention Matrix and point to the matrix-guide.

The matrix-guide does indeed say that it's "for TC39 delegates", but the content seems pretty general to me.

[10:48:27.0614] <jmdyck>
It could maybe be re-titled.

Ah it is indeed linked there, never paid much attention to the very start of the spec, although its still arguably obscure even there (consider a lot of people open the spec via permalinks to specific sections away from the top), my questions remains as to why is it not in any non-technical or Google-indexable page? It almost makes it feel like this place is trying to be kept hidden or something...
