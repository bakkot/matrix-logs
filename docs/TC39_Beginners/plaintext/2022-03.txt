[03:43:58.0334] <destrox>
I was waiting for invide to repo now

[03:45:06.0193] <destrox>
There is sooo much information, i read at beggining i must be a contributor and after this i can create issue or PR

[03:45:39.0546] <ryzokuken>
hello destrox 

[03:46:10.0876] <ryzokuken>
I'm not sure about what you aim to do, can you please explain?

[03:46:29.0450] <ryzokuken>
you can file issues and make PRs to TC39 repos without filling any forms

[03:48:01.0497] <destrox>
I want to send a proposal with new feature

[03:48:57.0667] <destrox>
I read this on CONTRIBUTING.md

[03:49:09.0163] <destrox>
https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md
There

[03:50:11.0836] <destrox>
https://github.com/PatrykKuniczak/proposal-full-trim
This is my proposal, what i must do now?

I read i must create fork of ecma262, and i do this

[03:50:41.0791] <destrox>
then i read, edit spec.emu and create PR

[03:51:16.0842] <destrox>
But i was looking for (My first ss) and i think i must be a contributor for make PR

[03:51:33.0316] <ryzokuken>
the PR is the final step, you can ignore it for now

[03:51:53.0425] <ryzokuken>
for now, you need to add an explainer for your proposal, that would be the first step

[03:52:25.0366] <ryzokuken>
secondly, you can start writing the spec text although it's not absolutely necessary to be finished right away

[03:53:34.0658] <ryzokuken>
once you've done that, you can ask someone to champion your proposal, unless you're a delegate yourself

[03:55:10.0201] <destrox>
> <@usharma:igalia.com> once you've done that, you can ask someone to champion your proposal, unless you're a delegate yourself

Ok, how can i contact with 1 of the champions?

[03:55:41.0861] <ryzokuken>
destrox: there is a forum/ML where you can discuss your proposal (es.discourse.group)

[03:55:51.0579] <destrox>
And can i delete my application to be a contributor, because it's unnecessary

[03:56:33.0400] <ryzokuken>
destrox: well, I'm sure you'd need it at some point as the author of the proposal, but I'll ask around.

[03:57:53.0031] <destrox>
Ok, i have rea

[03:59:55.0784] <destrox>
read, if my proposal go forward on next and next step i need to be contributor for agree my IPR

[04:00:23.0677] <destrox>
Ecma can take my proposal without money and etc. from my side

[04:00:46.0023] <destrox>
i hope you understand, my english isn't perfect :)

[04:01:05.0966] <destrox>
Else let's write it i try my best for explain this for you ;)
