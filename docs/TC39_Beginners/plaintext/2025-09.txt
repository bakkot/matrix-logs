> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> CyanChanges there were some discussion about that in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments/blob/master/0-module-and-module-source.md (cc Kris Kowal). That proposal wouldn't allow you to modify the module cache, but it would allow you to run some modules in a _clean cache_ that can be partially popupated from an old cache. So you'd be able to re-run a module and its importers, while keeping the old version of all the other branches in the module tree

Is this being working on? 3 years ago and still stage 1 üòµ‚Äçüí´

people tend to work on proposals based on need (and the justification they can make to their managers), not "this one has been in the same stage for a long time". maybe you should contact the proposal authors and ask how you can help to move it forward?

For that proposal specifically, I believe there is some movement again but kriskowal can say more
