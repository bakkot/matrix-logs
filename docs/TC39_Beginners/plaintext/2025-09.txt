> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> CyanChanges there were some discussion about that in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments/blob/master/0-module-and-module-source.md (cc Kris Kowal). That proposal wouldn't allow you to modify the module cache, but it would allow you to run some modules in a _clean cache_ that can be partially popupated from an old cache. So you'd be able to re-run a module and its importers, while keeping the old version of all the other branches in the module tree

Is this being working on? 3 years ago and still stage 1 😵‍💫

people tend to work on proposals based on need (and the justification they can make to their managers), not "this one has been in the same stage for a long time". maybe you should contact the proposal authors and ask how you can help to move it forward?

For that proposal specifically, I believe there is some movement again but kriskowal can say more

Yeah, we have been relying on a working shim for this feature for some time. We picked up another volunteer (ZB) to help move it along, and some of my time has been freed up so folks can expect regular updates at plenary

let's just say the shim is being thoroughly validated 😄
