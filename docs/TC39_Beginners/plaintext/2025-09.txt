> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> CyanChanges there were some discussion about that in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments/blob/master/0-module-and-module-source.md (cc Kris Kowal). That proposal wouldn't allow you to modify the module cache, but it would allow you to run some modules in a _clean cache_ that can be partially popupated from an old cache. So you'd be able to re-run a module and its importers, while keeping the old version of all the other branches in the module tree

Is this being working on? 3 years ago and still stage 1 😵‍💫
