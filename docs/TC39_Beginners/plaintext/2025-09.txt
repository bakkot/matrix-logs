> <@nicolo-ribaudo:matrix.org> CyanChanges there were some discussion about that in https://github.com/tc39/proposal-compartments/blob/master/0-module-and-module-source.md (cc Kris Kowal). That proposal wouldn't allow you to modify the module cache, but it would allow you to run some modules in a _clean cache_ that can be partially popupated from an old cache. So you'd be able to re-run a module and its importers, while keeping the old version of all the other branches in the module tree

Is this being working on? 3 years ago and still stage 1 üòµ‚Äçüí´

people tend to work on proposals based on need (and the justification they can make to their managers), not "this one has been in the same stage for a long time". maybe you should contact the proposal authors and ask how you can help to move it forward?

For that proposal specifically, I believe there is some movement again but kriskowal can say more

Yeah, we have been relying on a working shim for this feature for some time. We picked up another volunteer (ZB) to help move it along, and some of my time has been freed up so folks can expect regular updates at plenary

let's just say the shim is being thoroughly validated üòÑ

What‚Äôs the expectation for presenting a proposal a second time? Is it presenting the delta/changes between the last presentation or is it more like presenting for the first time?

[11:16:48.0272] <Ashley Claymore>
I always include a quick recap of the proposal. There are lots of proposals, and not everyone can make every meeting, or there could be new attendees. So I think it's nice to give some context.

[11:17:25.0442] <Ashley Claymore>
Though naturally don't eat up so much of the timebox that there isn't time to actually talk about the new parts

Right, elevator pitch the context, but don't linger on it. People who were around for the previous meeting just need a refresher and don't want to sit thru a re-explanation; people who missed it need a quick update to get context but can look elsewhere for fuller details.
