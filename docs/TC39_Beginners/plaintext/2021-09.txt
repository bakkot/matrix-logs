Q: Are `SyntaxError`'s reserved only for early errors / parsing errors, or can it be thrown by APIs?

[15:40:49.0973] <jschoi>
They can be thrown by APIs; JSON.parse throws SyntaxErrors for invalid input. 

[15:41:03.0660] <jschoi>
* They can be thrown by APIs; JSON.parse and parseInt throw SyntaxErrors for invalid input. 

[15:41:37.0364] <jschoi>
* They can be thrown by APIs; JSON.parse throws SyntaxErrors for invalid input. 

[15:42:17.0383] <jschoi>
(parseInt should throw SyntaxError, but it returns NaN instead. https://github.com/tc39/proposal-number-fromstring would throw SyntaxErrors.)

[15:42:22.0242] <jschoi>
* (parseInt should throw SyntaxError, but it returns NaN instead. https://github.com/tc39/proposal-number-fromstring would throw SyntaxErrors.)

Does this seem like the right intuition?

[16:59:17.0835] <ljharb>
i would prefer a syntax error, since the syntax is wrong. but i think something in the web recently chose type error for something like that with URLs
