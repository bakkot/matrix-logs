The more I work on my Parser Augmentation proposal the more it seems like a _really_ good idea. It doesn't require browser buyin, and it has a really slow and gentle adoption strategy, which just feels nice ðŸ™‚ https://es.discourse.group/t/proposal-parser-augmentation-mechanism/2008

but the best part of all is, it's just describing stuff people are already doing

[22:42:08.0630] <Danielle Church>
this is basically just a spec of "this is what it means to be a transpiler", but it has legs
