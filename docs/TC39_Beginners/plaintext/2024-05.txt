What is a cover grammar? Where does one go to learn more about them?

A cover grammar, at least the way the ES spec uses it, is sort of a hack to avoid a conflict in a bottom-up parser.

That definition says "to remain context free and unambiguous", but the grammar would certainly still be context free without the cover, and it would in some cases also be unambiguous.
