What is a cover grammar? Where does one go to learn more about them?

Well, there's https://v8.dev/blog/understanding-ecmascript-part-4

A cover grammar, at least the way the ES spec uses it, is sort of a hack to avoid a conflict in a bottom-up parser.

That definition says "to remain context free and unambiguous", but the grammar would certainly still be context free without the cover, and it would in some cases also be unambiguous.

(E.g., in the case that CoverParenthesizedExpressionEtc deals with, there's no ambiguity: either the parenthesized thing is followed by an `=>` or it isn't, and that tells you whether it's a ParenthesizedExpression or ArrowFormalParameters. The problem is, that token is arbitrarily far away from where you would have to start taking different parse actions for the two possibilities.)

indeed.  the definition should be improved

Does the etymological trail for cover grammar end at 262 or did I miss a chapter of Knuth? (I have missed all chapters)

[11:55:33.0417] <jmdyck>
There are formal-language papers that talk about cover grammars, with roughly the same meaning, but typically not with 262's kind of use in mind?

he doesn't use the term "cover grammar" (and I'm not sure where that entered the lexicon), but he does... cover it...  sorry, I'll let myself out
