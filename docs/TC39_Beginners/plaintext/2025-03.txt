Hi, I'd like to know about this bug is valid? v8, spider monkey and JSC resulted as 'something'. 

If invalid, where can I find the section? :)
And the spec said: 

114.15.1 Static Semantics: Early Errors
Catch : catch ( CatchParameter ) Block
It is a Syntax Error if the BoundNames of CatchParameter contains any duplicate elements.
It is a Syntax Error if any element of the BoundNames of CatchParameter also occurs in the LexicallyDeclaredNames of Block.
It is a Syntax Error if any element of the BoundNames of CatchParameter also occurs in the VarDeclaredNames of Block.

Seokho Song: I agree that the given script is a Syntax Error (i.e., the bug appears to be valid).

I'm working on that on V8, there are test262 cases existed that need to be updated. It feels like a breaking change.

I'll open a PR to update the test262 cases to make sure they comply with the spec soon (or does this need a spec update to match with the engines' behavior?)

I'm not sure whether the spec should be changed to match implementations or vice versa in this case. Maybe start with an issue on ecma262 to get an official opinion.

Thanks! I filed an issue https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/3551

Seokho Song: Sorry, I forgot about Annex B. And the parser I used to check doesn't know about Annex B.

[18:12:37.0266] <Seokho Song>
It's okay haha at least I learned something about Annex B!

[18:17:00.0315] <jmdyck>
I have a couple PRs toward incorporating the Annex B modifications ('monkey patches') into the main body of the spec, which would prevent this kind of problem. But they haven't seen much attention.
