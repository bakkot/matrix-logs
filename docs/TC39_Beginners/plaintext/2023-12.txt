Hey, can anyone tell me if the proto-proposal I put on the Discourse (https://es.discourse.group/t/proposal-access-to-constructor-parameters-in-field-initializers/1862) is a reasonable thing to have posted?

it's definitely a reasonable thing to have posted, and that's the right place to post it :-)

Thank you! I always have an anxiety about walking into a place and saying the wrong thing, so I really appreciate the reassurance!

I suppose my next question is... what now? like, I figure this will bounce around the discourse for a week or two. presumably at some point I fork a repo and try to write something that looks like an actual technical proposal? I'm afraid I'm very new to proposing ideas to a standards committee, any guidance you could give would be greatly appreciated ðŸ˜…
