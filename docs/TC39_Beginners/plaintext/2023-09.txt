Hi, what's the difference between Completion Record `normal` and `return` type?

If you evaluate a statement (within a function body, say), and it causes a return from that function, then that's signaled via a `return` completion. If evaluation is to proceed normally to the next statement, then that's signaled by a `normal` completion.
