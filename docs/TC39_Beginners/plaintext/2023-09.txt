Hi, what's the difference between Completion Record `normal` and `return` type?

If you evaluate a statement (within a function body, say), and it causes a return from that function, then that's signaled via a `return` completion. If evaluation is to proceed normally to the next statement, then that's signaled by a `normal` completion.

Makes sense, but what about the next paragraph: "Callable objects that are defined in this specification only return a normal completion or a throw completion. Returning any other kind of Completion Record is considered an editorial error."

I'll expect it to include `return` completion?

No, if, within function A, you call function B, that call cannot cause a return from function A. (But it can cause A to throw.)
