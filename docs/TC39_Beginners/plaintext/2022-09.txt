Let me ask a question about the syntax-directed operation `StringNumericValue`. There doesn't seem to be a production definition of following case.

```
StrDecimalLiteral ::: + StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral
```

Is this not necessary? Or am I misunderstanding something?

That case is handled by the chain rule, see https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-algorithm-conventions-syntax-directed-operations

[06:28:56.0253] <тars>
Ah, I get it. Thanks! So, by the chain production rule, it implicitly includes the following:

```
StrDecimalLiteral ::: + StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral
  Return 1. StringNumericValue of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral
```

Am I correct?

It would be “Return Evaluation of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral”.

[07:03:48.0398] <тars>
What? How? Isn't the same syntax-directed operation reapplied to the sole right-hand side nonterminal? Where did the `Evaluation` come from?

My apologies; I misunderstood the question; I hadn’t realized you were talking about a specific syntax-directed operation. Yes, your interpretation is correct.

Oh, I’m relieved to hear that. I was just beginning to wonder if I had completely misunderstood something. You don't need to apologise! Thanks for the clarification. :)
