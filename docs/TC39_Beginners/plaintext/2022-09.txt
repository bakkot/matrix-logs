Let me ask a question about the syntax-directed operation `StringNumericValue`. There doesn't seem to be a production definition of following case.

```
StrDecimalLiteral ::: + StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral
```

Is this not necessary? Or am I misunderstanding something?

https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-stringnumericvalue

[04:22:48.0948] <jmdyck>
That case is handled by the chain rule, see https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-algorithm-conventions-syntax-directed-operations

[06:28:56.0253] <тars>
Ah, I get it. Thanks! So, by the chain production rule, it implicitly includes the following:

```
StrDecimalLiteral ::: + StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral
  Return 1. StringNumericValue of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral
```

Am I correct?

It would be “Return Evaluation of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral”.

[07:03:48.0398] <тars>
What? How? Isn't the same syntax-directed operation reapplied to the sole right-hand side nonterminal? Where did the `Evaluation` come from?

My apologies; I misunderstood the question; I hadn’t realized you were talking about a specific syntax-directed operation. Yes, your interpretation is correct.

Oh, I’m relieved to hear that. I was just beginning to wonder if I had completely misunderstood something. You don't need to apologise! Thanks for the clarification. :)

hi yall! does tc39 have any general newsletters or rss feeds that one can subscribe to to get notified on the latest proposals?

[21:10:16.0054] <ssamkough>
sorry if this is not where i should be posting, completely new to this

[21:11:01.0837] <jmdyck>
I think this is an appropriate place to post that question.

[21:11:41.0471] <jmdyck>
I believe the answer is no, but I'm not positive.

[21:14:48.0903] <jmdyck>
But if you 'watch' https://github.com/tc39/proposals, I think you'll get a notification whenever that repo changes, which might suffice?

[21:17:31.0925] <jmdyck>
(actually, you'll get notifications for more than just that, but you can filter out what you're not interested in)

[21:17:48.0901] <ssamkough>
Yeah I did that. Just feels like we should have a better way…

Like, I’d love for there to be some sort of newletter that gets sent every week (or even month) on updates to the things TC39 is working on

[21:18:04.0895] <ssamkough>
It can even be an RSS feed! But I bet people have thought of that and maybe there were issues with it?

[21:20:28.0839] <jmdyck>
So not just "here's a new proposal", but also "this proposal (active but not 'new' per se) changed in such-and-such a way" ?

[21:21:16.0900] <jmdyck>
(Because I can imagine automating the first, but not the second.)

[21:22:34.0997] <ssamkough>
yeah i think starting with the first (the automation part), then going with some more detailed things

[21:23:05.0566] <jmdyck>
Well, on second thought, you could automate the second, saying things like "In the X-proposal repo, these PRs were merged, these issues were closed, these were opened", that sort of thing.
