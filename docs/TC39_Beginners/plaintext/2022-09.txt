Let me ask a question about the syntax-directed operation `StringNumericValue`. There doesn't seem to be a production definition of following case.

```
StrDecimalLiteral ::: + StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral
```

Is this not necessary? Or am I misunderstanding something?

That case is handled by the chain rule, see https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-algorithm-conventions-syntax-directed-operations

Ah, I get it. Thanks! So, by the chain production rule, it implicitly includes the following:

```
StrDecimalLiteral ::: + StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral
  Return 1. StringNumericValue of StrUnsignedDecimalLiteral
```

Am I correct?
