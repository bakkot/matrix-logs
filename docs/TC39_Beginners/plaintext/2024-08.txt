I don't think so but in the past we've had delegates teaming up together to review a proposal to help someone with their first review

Process-wise, you are allowed to go and revive whatever is abandoned. I think there's a note to this effect in how-we-work or the process doc, but not absolutely sure

iirc, in general if the existing champions are no longer around, or are amenable; and if you've done the research to understand its status and its potential hurdles/constraints, then you can just summarily take it over and present it at plenary (usually as like an "update" first, and then advancement at a separate meeting, but that's not a requirement)

* (nvm, I read that as "reviewing")
