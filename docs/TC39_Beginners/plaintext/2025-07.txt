What does it mean to be a "delegate"?

[10:19:34.0193] <kriskowal>
Welcome styfle. Delegates are employees of an ECMA member organization who the company sends to represent some or all of their interests at plenary meetings.

[10:20:22.0108] <nicolo-ribaudo>
That you are one of the people representing your company in TC39. Most of the committee members are delegates of some company.

Delegates soemtimes voice their own opinions, and often those of their colleagues

Where can we find the list of "ECMA member organizations"?

[10:21:52.0679] <styfle>
Is Vercel one of them?

[10:22:22.0136] <styfle>
I just spoke to Tobias who said he hasn't championed a proposal before so now I'm not sure if we have anyone who has.

Thanks! And what does "GA rep" mean? I'm not seeing that defined in the documentation.

[12:46:16.0645] <kriskowal>
GA is General Assembly, the body overseeing all of ECMA, not just JavaScript.

Hey! I want to fill https://tc39.es/agreements/contributor/ and I am unsure whether it is required (or even just recommended/preferred) for me to use my real name, or whether it’s allowed for me to use an alias or nickname like “zamfofex” instead.

[13:29:08.0632] <ljharb>
i believe it's ideal to use your real name, but that pseudonymity is also fine
