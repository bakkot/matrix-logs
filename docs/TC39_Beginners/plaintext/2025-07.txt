What does it mean to be a "delegate"?

[10:19:34.0193] <kriskowal>
Welcome styfle. Delegates are employees of an ECMA member organization who the company sends to represent some or all of their interests at plenary meetings.

[10:20:22.0108] <nicolo-ribaudo>
That you are one of the people representing your company in TC39. Most of the committee members are delegates of some company.

Delegates soemtimes voice their own opinions, and often those of their colleagues 

[10:21:14.0264] <styfle>
Where can we find the list of "ECMA member organizations"?

[10:21:52.0679] <styfle>
Is Vercel one of them?

[10:22:22.0136] <styfle>
I just spoke to Tobias who said he hasn't championed a proposal before so now I'm not sure if we have anyone who has.

Thanks! And what does "GA rep" mean? I'm not seeing that defined in the documentation.

[12:46:16.0645] <kriskowal>
GA is General Assembly, the body overseeing all of ECMA, not just JavaScript.

Hey! I want to fill https://tc39.es/agreements/contributor/ and I am unsure whether it is required (or even just recommended/preferred) for me to use my real name, or whether it’s allowed for me to use an alias or nickname like “zamfofex” instead.

[13:29:08.0632] <ljharb>
i believe it's ideal to use your real name, but that pseudonymity is also fine

[14:06:21.0696] <jmdyck>
ISTR someone who didn't want to 'sign' with their real name, and that became a problem.

[14:07:17.0910] <jmdyck>
but maybe things have changed since then.

[14:15:31.0721] <Chris de Almeida>
IIRC, Ecma needs to know who they are, but we individually do not

[15:49:05.0750] <Aki>
Needs to be legal name (for some definition of legal name, which is actually a really squishy legal concept in many countries). Matching some form of id, I assume.
