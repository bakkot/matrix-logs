Is `NaN` a finite Number value in ecma262? Or not? I think it's not a finite Number value, but reading the specs below, all Number values except +∞𝔽 or -∞𝔽 could also be read as finite, so I was wondering about that.

https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type

No, NaN isn't finite. That section introduces the 3 special values (NaN and the infinities), and then says "The other values are the 'finite' values."

[06:04:18.0719] <jmdyck>
Are you suggesting that "other" could be read as "other than the 2 infinities", rather than "other than the 3 values introduced above"?

[06:08:04.0515] <тars>
Oh, I see. It's crystal clear now! Thank you very much.

> Are you suggesting that "other" could be read as "other than the 2 infinities", rather than "other than the 3 values introduced above"?

Yes I thought so, but I understand "other" means 3 special values above now. Thanks.

no problem.

can also verify via: `Number.isFinite(NaN)`

[06:35:39.0828] <тars>
Thanks! Actually, I had noticed that, but their definition is like `If number is not finite, return false.` and I didn't get what "not finite" really meant. So that also made me wonder. lol

As someone who is not a member of TC39 or ECMA, where should I start if I want to make a new proposal? Would it be better to start by writing a document using the template below and then ask someone here to review it?

https://github.com/tc39/template-for-proposals

[05:32:56.0689] <ryzokuken>
yeah, you can start authoring a proposal and ask someone to champion it

[05:33:08.0771] <littledan>
Also see how-we-work for a practical guide (the template does not include this)

[05:33:14.0283] <ryzokuken>
maybe a faster place to start/iterate would be the discourse 

[05:35:48.0981] <тars>
Ok, Thanks!

Hi, all. 👋 This is only my second time attending TC39, and the first time was over four years ago.  Since we're less than 24 hours from the start, I'm trying to get a feel for what to expect, along the lines of "when will the draft schedule be posted?", and "how can I test my configuration to make sure I'm ready to present with no technical glitches?"

[10:25:55.0359] <ptomato>
hi Alex, and welcome! the draft schedule is ideally posted the day before, but sometimes that's not possible

[10:26:18.0100] <Alex Vincent>
-- a little hand-holding before the meeting starts with someone who's presented before would be very much appreciated.

[10:26:28.0830] <ptomato>
there will be people in the meeting room before it starts in order to do a tech check

[10:26:29.0545] <Alex Vincent>
 * -- a little hand-holding before the meeting starts with someone who's presented before would be very much appreciated.

[10:26:42.0185] <ptomato>
yeah, this is a good place to ask questions!

[10:28:24.0332] <Alex Vincent>
When do you expect the meeting room to be operational for that tech check?

[10:29:23.0533] <ptomato>
the chairs have mentioned it'll be available 30 minutes before the start of the meeting

[10:30:26.0483] <Alex Vincent>
oh, right, the link isn't available yet 🤦‍♂️

[10:31:41.0065] <ptomato>
I believe you have access as an invited expert to the tc39/Reflector github repository for meeting logistics information - I'd recommend subscribing to notifications on that repo

[10:32:47.0419] <ptomato>
(that's also where the draft schedule will be posted)

[10:32:54.0042] <Alex Vincent>
I _am_ watching the repository, and subscribed to the "93rd Meeting" issue.  If that means I'm all set regarding the news, then I'm good for now.

[10:33:45.0455] <Alex Vincent>
(I also hope no one remembers my arrogant know-a-lot attitude at my first meeting's beginners session 😅)

[10:33:51.0518] <ptomato>
ah, great. that's all you need. notifications will be published there

[10:34:34.0332] <ptomato>
likely they will be mentioned in the TC39 Delegates channel on Matrix as well, but the repo is the source of truth

[10:42:59.0930] <Alex Vincent>
Thank you.  :)

yulia What does STR mean?

[02:00:09.0221] <yulia>
oh, Steps-to-reproduce

[05:56:38.0147] <linusg>
is it possible to change the affiliation shown next to my name on TCQ? The company I work for (and have set on my GitHub profile) has nothing to do with why I'm here

[05:56:45.0000] <linusg>
(probably an edge case :))

[05:57:08.0356] <ryzokuken>
TCQ just picks it up from GitHub 😢

[05:57:19.0514] <ryzokuken>
but you could make a PR!
