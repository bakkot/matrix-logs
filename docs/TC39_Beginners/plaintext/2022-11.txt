Is `NaN` a finite Number value in ecma262? Or not? I think it's not a finite Number value, but reading the specs below, all Number values except +‚àûùîΩ or -‚àûùîΩ could also be read as finite, so I was wondering about that.

No, NaN isn't finite. That section introduces the 3 special values (NaN and the infinities), and then says "The other values are the 'finite' values."

Are you suggesting that "other" could be read as "other than the 2 infinities", rather than "other than the 3 values introduced above"?

[06:08:04.0515] <—Çars>
Oh, I see. It's crystal clear now! Thank you very much.

Yes I thought so, but I understand "other" means 3 special values above now. Thanks.

no problem.

can also verify via: `Number.isFinite(NaN)`

[06:35:39.0828] <—Çars>
Thanks! Actually, I had noticed that, but their definition is like `If number is not finite, return false.` and I didn't get what "not finite" really meant. So that also made me wonder. lol

As someone who is not a member of TC39 or ECMA, where should I start if I want to make a new proposal? Would it be better to start by writing a document using the template below and then ask someone here to review it?

https://github.com/tc39/template-for-proposals

[05:32:56.0689] <ryzokuken>
yeah, you can start authoring a proposal and ask someone to champion it

[05:33:08.0771] <littledan>
Also see how-we-work for a practical guide (the template does not include this)

[05:33:14.0283] <ryzokuken>
maybe a faster place to start/iterate would be the discourse 

[05:35:48.0981] <—Çars>
Ok, Thanks!
