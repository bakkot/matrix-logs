Is `NaN` a finite Number value in ecma262? Or not? I think it's not a finite Number value, but reading the specs below, all Number values except +∞𝔽 or -∞𝔽 could also be read as finite, so I was wondering about that.

No, NaN isn't finite. That section introduces the 3 special values (NaN and the infinities), and then says "The other values are the 'finite' values."

Are you suggesting that "other" could be read as "other than the 2 infinities", rather than "other than the 3 values introduced above"?
