Is `NaN` a finite Number value in ecma262? Or not? I think it's not a finite Number value, but reading the specs below, all Number values except +‚àûùîΩ or -‚àûùîΩ could also be read as finite, so I was wondering about that.

https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type

No, NaN isn't finite. That section introduces the 3 special values (NaN and the infinities), and then says "The other values are the 'finite' values."

[06:04:18.0719] <jmdyck>
Are you suggesting that "other" could be read as "other than the 2 infinities", rather than "other than the 3 values introduced above"?

[06:08:04.0515] <—Çars>
Oh, I see. It's crystal clear now! Thank you very much.

> Are you suggesting that "other" could be read as "other than the 2 infinities", rather than "other than the 3 values introduced above"?

Yes I thought so, but I understand "other" means 3 special values above now. Thanks.

no problem.

can also verify via: `Number.isFinite(NaN)`

[06:35:39.0828] <—Çars>
Thanks! Actually, I had noticed that, but their definition is like `If number is not finite, return false.` and I didn't get what "not finite" really meant. So that also made me wonder. lol

As someone who is not a member of TC39 or ECMA, where should I start if I want to make a new proposal? Would it be better to start by writing a document using the template below and then ask someone here to review it?

https://github.com/tc39/template-for-proposals

[05:32:56.0689] <ryzokuken>
yeah, you can start authoring a proposal and ask someone to champion it

[05:33:08.0771] <littledan>
Also see how-we-work for a practical guide (the template does not include this)

[05:33:14.0283] <ryzokuken>
maybe a faster place to start/iterate would be the discourse 

[05:35:48.0981] <—Çars>
Ok, Thanks!

Hi, all. üëã This is only my second time attending TC39, and the first time was over four years ago.  Since we're less than 24 hours from the start, I'm trying to get a feel for what to expect, along the lines of "when will the draft schedule be posted?", and "how can I test my configuration to make sure I'm ready to present with no technical glitches?"

[10:25:55.0359] <ptomato>
hi Alex, and welcome! the draft schedule is ideally posted the day before, but sometimes that's not possible

[10:26:18.0100] <Alex Vincent>
-- a little hand-holding before the meeting starts with someone who's presented before would be very much appreciated.

[10:26:28.0830] <ptomato>
there will be people in the meeting room before it starts in order to do a tech check

[10:26:29.0545] <Alex Vincent>
 * -- a little hand-holding before the meeting starts with someone who's presented before would be very much appreciated.

[10:26:42.0185] <ptomato>
yeah, this is a good place to ask questions!

[10:28:24.0332] <Alex Vincent>
When do you expect the meeting room to be operational for that tech check?

[10:29:23.0533] <ptomato>
the chairs have mentioned it'll be available 30 minutes before the start of the meeting

[10:30:26.0483] <Alex Vincent>
oh, right, the link isn't available yet ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[10:31:41.0065] <ptomato>
I believe you have access as an invited expert to the tc39/Reflector github repository for meeting logistics information - I'd recommend subscribing to notifications on that repo

[10:32:47.0419] <ptomato>
(that's also where the draft schedule will be posted)

[10:32:54.0042] <Alex Vincent>
I _am_ watching the repository, and subscribed to the "93rd Meeting" issue.  If that means I'm all set regarding the news, then I'm good for now.

[10:33:45.0455] <Alex Vincent>
(I also hope no one remembers my arrogant know-a-lot attitude at my first meeting's beginners session üòÖ)

[10:33:51.0518] <ptomato>
ah, great. that's all you need. notifications will be published there

[10:34:34.0332] <ptomato>
likely they will be mentioned in the TC39 Delegates channel on Matrix as well, but the repo is the source of truth

[10:42:59.0930] <Alex Vincent>
Thank you.  :)
