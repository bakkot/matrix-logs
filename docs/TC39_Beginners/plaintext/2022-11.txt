Is `NaN` a finite Number value in ecma262? Or not? I think it's not a finite Number value, but reading the specs below, all Number values except +‚àûùîΩ or -‚àûùîΩ could also be read as finite, so I was wondering about that.

No, NaN isn't finite. That section introduces the 3 special values (NaN and the infinities), and then says "The other values are the 'finite' values."

Are you suggesting that "other" could be read as "other than the 2 infinities", rather than "other than the 3 values introduced above"?

Oh, I see. It's crystal clear now! Thank you very much.

Yes I thought so, but I understand "other" means 3 special values above now. Thanks.

no problem.

can also verify via: `Number.isFinite(NaN)`
