hi i am new to the tc39 but i have a realtiv clear goal could some one assist me to get my first proposal started or maybe some one likes to champion it for me directly

[03:05:19.0229] <frank-dspeed>
i need the following: proposal importScripts (a sync import of scripts that get executed in order as they would be inlined) taking infinity urls and strings as args 

[03:06:36.0343] <frank-dspeed>
the current existing implementation from w3c inside workers should get part of general ECMAScript Next to solve interop problems in diffrent engines at present the most engines do implement nativ require mixed with this functionality

[03:07:02.0620] <frank-dspeed>
i am part of the wintercg but i am not familar with the tc39 process and it is a hugh one to get familar with

[03:07:28.0039] <frank-dspeed>
https://www.w3.org/community/wintercg/

[03:10:05.0020] <frank-dspeed>
maybe a bit more background while ESM is great it is async by default so it can not get used in ECMAScript Engines that relay on native code sideEffects

[03:10:21.0905] <frank-dspeed>
as it will get loaded and executed after the process first tick

[03:11:02.0081] <frank-dspeed>
we need a import for Scripts ESM only covers Modules

frank-dspeed: cool! I'd suggest starting by reading some of the "Proposals" pages on https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work

i need help again which category is that https://github.com/frank-dspeed/tc39-proposal-importScripts
Normative: changes impacting JavaScript behavior in some way. These changes are called "observable" because it is possible to write code to "observe" the change in behavior.
Editorial: any non-normative changes to spec text including typo fixes, changes to the document style, etc.
Layering: refactoring of specification text, algorithms, and/or embedder hooks to enable clean integration of the JavaScript specification with other specifications that use JavaScript.
Markup: non-visible changes to markup in the spec
Meta: changes to documents about this repository (e.g. readme.md or contributing.md) and other supporting documents or scripts (e.g. package.json, design documents, etc.)

[02:28:02.0713] <nicolo-ribaudo>
That is definitely normative, because you can write JS code that uses that new proposed feature

[02:28:23.0688] <frank-dspeed>
ok thanks for clarifying

[03:28:43.0301] <frank-dspeed>
can some people please look into this and give feedback https://github.com/frank-dspeed/tc39-proposal-importScripts/issues/2

[03:29:11.0076] <frank-dspeed>
i am not sure if that case leads to web-reality-pr https://github.com/tc39/how-we-work/blob/main/pr.md#web-reality-prs  and so i would need to change the name of the proposal?

[03:31:32.0394] <nicolo-ribaudo>
Web reality PRs are for "all the engines agree on X, but the spec says Y: we should update the spec to say X". This is not the case for your proposal, since importScripts is not already available everywhere

It's possible that the name would have to be changed, but that is a stage 2 discussion. Your goal now is to get to stage 1, which means "we have a problem: ecmascript does not provide a way of loading scripts from within the language, and it's needed because ...".
Sure, we must make sure that the proposal does not break the web and we can start thinking about it, but it's not high-priority at the moment.

nicolo-ribaudo: thanks a lot sorry for my confusion that explaination helped me a lot.
