Hello, I'm thinking about allowing purge(/access to) module import cache in ECMAScript.
What do you think about this?

Being able to access the module cache will make HMR easier, without restarting the entire environment or bundling things together.

I like it, but i think it's been discussed before.

If you do move forward with it, please tag me ðŸ˜€

Is there a time or reference to the message of that discussion, so I can look for it?
